What does he do? The CSSD in Praza doesn't know Voldemort or sugar
The new Chief City of the CSSD will, accordingly, have to convince a certain language barier to understand their ODS members in the Prague Council and in the Representative.
Journal Currently.cz members of the new Council of the CSSD "tested" as they know the notoric introduced slange, which has occurred in the Council during the last years when Prague has been governed by the current coalition partners.
The encoding dictionary, which the Prague political smiling has introduced during the previous era of the recipient of Paul Bema, describes some of the most famous positions, positions, and couchs in metropolis.
It was surprised that new advice concepts were not too known.
At least it says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm in Prague Policy more new," he reacted to the "agricultural" dictionary test for the culture of Luka Kaucky.
And in the case of a political veteran, he also responded to Karel Brezin's advice.
Maybe on the "Golf Jam."
"It's the only expression you're suggesting me that I sometimes use."
"I don't generally recognize Slang."
From the dictionary, whose expressions the journal Actually.cz published the years in June before the election congress of the ODS, he chose six examples, especially those who are nottoricly connected to the Prague Master.
The socialists had to explain the ideas of "Voldemort", "the largest golf jacket in Praza", "Go to the sugar", "the birds of the main city" and "shopping".
Three of the advisers with a bird agreed, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who will be in the future to lead Prague School - first he promised the conversation, but he didn't take the phone anymore.
The fifth adviser Peter Dolinek refused the test.
"I don't solve these things, and the way civil democracy takes place, I'm not going to evaluate."
"I now resolve how we will understand our programs," he answered.
As already said, advisory Lucas Kaucky would not have known above that the word of the influenced business and friends of the expressor of Béma Romana Janouska was the case.
"Woldemort" doesn't say anything to Kauck, and the only term that he recalled right in the test is "the greatest golf jacket in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, "and now he adds, "but I know it more from the news."
"I'm gonna have to pay a same language course," he says.
The golf jacket then like the tonnel Blanka is decrypting not only Karel Brézin's matador but also advisers for Life § Lucas Plachy.
Both social democracy then know who is Voldemort, and Luka Plachému is responsibility to find this position - a thorough significance of the expression "Go to the sugar" .
"I mean to go to the same Prague Business," is the Plach nearly resolving that it's about the seat of the Janoušk fires.
In accordance with Brussels, knowledge has been made more than news than to use such a vocabulary.
In the social democracy, according to test frequency, there is no similar slanging words.
"I've been happy with my colleagues, but it seems we have nothing like that."
"We call us more names, sometimes shortcuts and decomoline names," says the CSSD President Petr Hulinski, whose sides are overflowing Hulda.
"In school they called me Briza, but I don't know if colleagues also call me like that," he admits to his own overseer Karel Brézin.
The journal Attually.ch name tried and worked.
The Council Weinert is for Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, representative Miroslav Poche, who has warned on himself before elections when sponsoring the page, has some colleagues of the "Players".
The overseers are also the only way social democracy accepts in the internal talk.
Huld's Hulin's cousin doesn't hear, but the journal is currently.ch menal also another survival of this pregnancy president.
The "Doctor of Auditor's Rights" says Peter Hulinski got his title in the broadcast police academy.
The government wants to restrict the torture of "Charoènic", issued the brochure.
Women announced in Burkina Faso for the chirurgie of mine several common characters.
In addition to the elderly generation, they cannot participate in the work, such as health care, are free and do not have children.
The one who's going to be "stood" is sent to the isolation so that it does not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man's just a very rare trial."
"They do not reject young healthy women, because they are helping to work and born children," describes a series of sisters in the main city of Western Africa, Burkina Faso, age in a special house of more than hundred women who have taken their community out of their rows.
The local government has now decided to cross the unusual "social measures".
She issued an information brochure that would help her to restrict.
But he's got a little bitch.
"For more than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," he warned about the outcome of the written lighting journal Die Standard.
In other African countries, accusation of the ship is running.
In Ghana, a neighborhood of Burkina Faso, last week, Ammy Hemmah's twenty-year-old Ammy died after three women and two men tortured her, smoked her with oil and deceived her.
He informed the BBC server about the case.
The guards claim that it was an emergency meeting of the circumstances.
The woman, according to their version, was raised up a woman, which is used for ritual uncleanness.
He took up what the group wanted from the woman to get out of the bad spirit.
The isolations of "Charo`nic" support people without a view to the level of achieved education.
The journal Der Standard quoted a twenty-year businessman from Burkina Faso: "The consumers of human souls represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to rest, the president himself has become in the nearest year in Burkina.
"The Gambian president Jammy, after his grandfather's death, broke the widespread herself on the ship, which was evidently to share in her death and try to kill the black magic as well as the same president."
"To help, he invited the ships from near Guinea, which, after the delivery of police, soldiers and personal protection of the President, violently separated the appropriate chosen men and women from the villages to the presidential farm in Canila," she reported in their report of Amnesty International.
In the farm, people had to drink the electrocar of the wood with hallucinogenic rubber, which also caused the street and renal poetry.
Two prisoners didn't survive on the farm.
Finally, after international pressure, almost thousand prisoners were released to freedom.
Bakal's payer: Topi in stones, higher debt signed
An elderly subsequent man walked from the door of the client center of RPG Byty "hlobaron" Zenjak Bakaly, the largest private owner of the households in Czechland.
Under the attention he took a folder and brought a new payment in it to three dwellings: to his own, to his daughter, and to his son, who is in the execution of judgment.
All three just decreased.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay for 2+1 second category 4100 crown since the next year.
"And that's not a warm water there and it must be a petroleum (stone on a hot burning, etc.)," the man shows a ring in a new son's composition, on which the signature has full power.
"But I signed it," explains the half of the harmful and half of the regeneration.
BytyOKD.cz civil association, which the new premises marked as "incorrect and unfair", advises the recipients to not sign and wait until 7.
But the man has only his hands over it.
"The one says it, the other it," it's dark.
The island becomes a big deregulation laborer.
After the New Year, a large number of apartments that have in the Czech Republic is still unfair.
This is why it has decided to visit the "laborator" personally.
The Havirov expectation of RPG is one of the total four in Austria, and in the nineth hour it is already filled.
The security agency and the calling device are right next to the door.
"Smoke 2011", lighting the special button on its relevant display.
One hooking and out of the machine is going out a paper with a number.
Don't even read "157" and your number is already drinking on a large screen under a spring of wait.
You're on the row for half seconds.
A couple of elderly women have been asked after a minute, but the new names are obviously not concerned.
Most people have come to solve running problems like otherwise - requesting correction, accurate events and similar.
The letters with new payments are reached in Austria to the mailboxes of the recipient with total 44 thousand RPG portfolio apart from half November.
The RPG Byty in letters increases the amount of 15 to 38 per cent.
The special cross-border for new names was opened at the customer center on November 18.
"It's going over a week, so it's just in the middle," they're answering the workmaster after a minute of weight when the client's represented as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalov's former horn habitats are local emergency subjects.
Before elections, the President of the Parliament and the island patriarch Lubomir Zaorálek from the CSSD was able to take it quite slowly, and now the local newspapers are filled with him.
"Two years after them I want a new ground."
"They didn't change my board on the board," the mentioned man's instruction.
Moreover, according to the employees, the employees will come to convince themselves whether they will get a slider from us if it signs the time the RPG promises to them in the special offer.
Furthermore, the final payments will be able to sign up to 15th.
Haviron's "deregulation" over the wheel, but the question is not absolutely paid.
"From 360 clients yesterday for 2011 was there only 40 to fifty people," they believe that the workers were over-ground.
Instead, the RPG on the web and its successes is involving individual contracts where it will be necessary.
However, if both sides are incompatible with us, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It's not about threatening, but about information about the only possible and the whole legitimate legal procedure," RPG warns on its pages.
"Nobody's judged here," thinks one of the RPG Byty workers and a man in the street before the customer center gives it partly for the truth.
"I have 13 thousand income and I have five thousand for food, I don't have to judge," he says.
But the worker's appeal is just to disappoint.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zarael shows them that they don't sign, that people may wait," he says.
The regulation of the appropriations ends in the part of the Czech Republic with the new 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, their economic need is to increase.
"They still do not have any more need for the simple maintenance of the apartment fund," Paul Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty resident portfolio, said that the accommodation of the householder's owners is a major increasing premises.
During five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could invest four billion apartments, four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large screen increases in the street towards the seats of the seat of the haviry waiter until then repeats a few redly highlighted information.
"Increase of profitable in 2011 to 15% and less about 31 200 apartments, it is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it'll be the most of 7.50 Kh per meter fourth and month," it will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will be charged by 38 percent.
"In these cases there is an increase from extremely low amount of 19.66 Kč for a quarter meter," advises RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the next year will be the same.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not exhaust the salt payments, but will be distributed to four to eight years.
Moreover, it adds additional commitment: all money from increased rent (see graph) gives company from rental to apartment, mainly to warm support - new windows and warming.
Firstly, there are people who are signing an agreement on increased premises.
The office belongs to a school, they understand it.
The Aviopoint building in Brň is the new seat of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to also hide the school with everything that belongs to it - with color walls, imaginable inhabitants, buy games and even miniature games on foreign teras.
From October of the latest year, she can be visited by the Children of the Arch.Design employees.
The Arch.Design project-architectural company, from which a series of significant burning buildings was taken, computerized with the Space for its firewall from the first drawings of the Aviopoint building.
It also works nearly 90 people in the babybooma, and it depends on that women of projectors and ativities may return to work.
Along with the options of decreased accounts, the school is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to his employees in the social programme.
Creators and characteristics so have the opportunity to deal with the child's care.
The Officers of Arch.Design and with the support of the leadership have been able to obtain the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The Fire Department is financed by the European Social Fund by the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the CAR.
Thanks to grant financing (intakes at 2,8 miles [2,8 miles]) they could buy equipment and equipment and ensure the staff and operation within two years.
Arch.Design has the obligation to operate a school for their own costs after 3 years after the expenses of the financial contribution (2 years).
The preparation of the project was a year and, with a request for an amendment, substantially helped the Economy Rating company.
Peči assures a rubber staff, a whole dayly cares for children’s health sister and MSH, so children can go to school without a restriction, even though their age of 3 years older.
'Cause it's about the "school", there can be only five children at the same time, but in the day they're stuck more.
The training of school is flexible in accordance with the needs of parents and children of all employees has the same right to use the school without regard to the hierarchie of the position in the company.
Despite individual education and care, the programme full in the sculpture is comparable to the pre-school education programme.
Children are not only playing here but also guaranteed by quality education - from the basic knowledge to the preparation of school lawyers, it is also learned by the language.
The trial is not only equipped by players, players, but also by computers that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates friends and positives.
Parents can always check their child and avoid stress with the latest education of children from schools remote from parents’ work.
Parents thus use the work for more productive time.
It is not wonderful that there is naturally a loyal relationship with the employee - an employer.
Arch.Design has thus been assigned to the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit to the collection of new employees, are friends to the family and has strengthened personal marketing through this programme.
The house of the bone is fascinated after 100 years. See insides from Gaudí
The street looks like the burst of the wheat, the stage at the dinosaur feet, and the balcones are opened by the mouth.
This is Casa Batlló's house in Barcellona from the Catholic Catholic Antoni Gaudí.
From the local houses, he served his organic faces to the overseer of the House from the bones.
Organic faces, wild colors, unusual use of rocks, cocktails and muscles, fasade at the winds and all present mixtures, all of this is typical for the Antoni Gaudí's session.
The middle of the house is playing dreams, colors and textures of nature and animals.
When detailed observation is to see geometric, rytme, and exactly thought line.
On the night the whole fasad is even more dramatic, it is highlighted so that the shadow of the colour tree is still strengthened.
The guilty and the injury of the curses also appears in the interiors.
The tree in the waves copys windows, swimming, oproof elements of the door, cook and bars.
The house of Batlló, standing in the quarter of EÂmple on the strange purchasing street Passeig de Gracia # 43, has been replaced from 1877 from Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction was spent two years, and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, a rich prominent Josep Batlló, continued to build an old building and building completely newly, but soon Gaudi's idea on an obscure and lower conversion.
The house of Casa Batllo, but Antoni Gaudi didn't work alone.
Josep Mary Jujol cooperated with him.
Just on his projecting wheel, the decoration for the representative apartment of the owners of the neighborhood and the use of the brain on the fashion has occurred.
She worked on the fashion, even a number of other creators and artists.
The joint work on the proposals of Casa Batlló home started successfully collaborating with Jujol with Gaud.
Jujol shared in the building of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and Güell Park, where there are other Gaudi works.
He served from the local homes of the walls after the end of his organic faces of the "Home of the bones".
Others, because of a specific mechanism of opening windows, began to call him "the living house".
It is also said that on the top of the building, the sword of the Sanhedrin Jira, the Catalan Patron, is likely.
Hidden religious motives also include other societies of building.
Gaudí has proposed for his time a unique system of central fuel with aircraft and typical comics.
Bizars can seem to be their fourty-five degrees.
In the creation of Gaudi, he did not absolutely comply with those building rules and refused to join them.
At the beginning of the building, he obtained a building authorisation from the city, but the information on the planned restructuring was so weakened that the city Council had been distorted and requested for recruitment within two years later.
For example, the Council advised that the building contained pillars and the public trailer.
However, it never happened, but only fifty days after the call of the city part, Joseph Batlló asked (and successfully) permission to find two highest fathers of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower father.
In the gallery in the second patrol, there was a community room and a third seat of the bed and a private part of the apartment.
The surface was found by the lowliness.
The whole six-party house is a stage that can be exited up to a single central tera.
The basic elements of the construction were the cancellation of all right angles and direct lines and their replacement by walls covered.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of promotion of room.
The Community part can be fully connected by the opening of the salon doors and the company can communicate with adequately, without preserving the particulars necessary for more intimate discussions.
A house with Gaudí’s construction also obtained a non-radical shot and two pairs more than a new fasade.
It is also related to Gaudi's game with light, blue and white glassed wheels which are covered by the internal court, and lights.
The two colors game adds the maximum light in all the fathers of the house.
It was easy to make it easy for the principle that white reflects the light more than the darkness that the sun-paper splits.
Casa Batllo House, which was included in 2005 in the Unesco World Heritage Fund, can everyone visit.
In the first view of the house, it is the most space and the most powerful to be accessible to the public.
For this step, the members decided until 2002, in the occasion of a hundred fifty-year-old birth of the slave creator.
They held on the watch because they were sure that it was a very valuable business and also broadcasts about the common and underground rooms, including central terases.
Incoming in memory is not determined, it does 16,50 euros and students, students, teachers, groups and holders of tourist evidence have twenty percent.
The sum is significantly higher than the price of entrance in other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to try the right atmosphere of the house with the dragons, you have to shame with some of the populations of the factory and visit it right home.
How to choose matrices and wheat: Women have other requests than men
Never honestly by bed, but the quality of laughing plates, so matrace and wheat, gives the foundation of the real good bed.
However, the harmonisation must be supplemented in order to claim to the specific representative.
When choosing, he decides about things, from weight, height, age, health status and the owner's headquarters.
It is also important for the type of interior to which matrace and roasts are moved.
Typical example?
Perhaps on weekend chalupes, where they are regularly disturbing, are not the suitable latex matraces, because I'm cutting up.
Moreover, it is very higher weight than standard polyuretan matrice.
Instead, it is necessary to turn regularly.
They do not have a lot of fluid channels in the kernel, and they lie still on the solid tables, keep the wheel: It could also be revealed under them.
It also decides the habit when choosing.
Whoever has longer spent in the spring, where many often uses a lot of higher matrace with a mixing level, it will be hard to feel well at low and strong surface.
"I hope everyone who came back from the NHL was trying to make me feel that he's not sleeping here."
"There's breads, feet, and sides needed matrace with a mixing layer of powder."
"That are recommended for people with sugar who have a nervous system disorder, so they are wrongly careful about ,information" from cloubs and skins," explains Sylva Hadamczik, which is specialised on a stumbled building.
Many hokeists, but even the other clients, therefore, married with a lining line ago.
"This is all right today, the appropriate matrace needs Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to evaluate the chicken line.
This "show" works easily.
It optimizes its dust and hair according to the absorbed warmness or adapts to your heat body.
There's nothing to do with you, you're going to turn you out tonight as a hard deal.
Just sleep better.
The line of the powder works as a protection from the dishes.
When you choose the size of the matrace to your height, add the length of the road, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Man even a woman with a height of about 180 cm so it lies 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be at a double of 90 cm, so doomed 180 cm.
In self-seed beds, such as in singlists, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For my visit too.
"It's a rule for the width of the liver simple: when you go on your back, you should have your hands adequately cut off in the hall," Ing. Helena Prokop, the characteristic of the Czech of Chalonics and Decorators, which is the problem of health sleep and ethnomy inhabitants already a few years and leads it to professional schools.
At the two-year-bye each own roof and matracy, but here's care for the purchase to wear the height of the matracy.
Otherwise, there will be nothing else than installing wheels into different heights, but it doesn't need to be given to you at each bed.
Feed matrace should have a height of at least 14 cm, types of a maturity bottle at least 15 centimeters, and then calculate at least three centimeters of the creation and cycling level.
"When you touch your hands or injury on the matracy, you must not have a sense of feeling," advises Helena Prokop.
Each matrix requires a certain type of roof.
The full-sized dog when the matrace and the foundation are like the growing syam doubles, they don't have anything to do in the clusters.
Matrace is bad, they can't make their ways, which is current today.
And because we're running in the night to 0.2 to 0.75 l road, it's that after five to seven years of matrice begins to make one large (and broken) network.
In addition, the experts reject the recruitment slogans on the life of maternity up to 25 years, or even life-life assurances.
But everything has its own.
And therefore, advice from the seller's practice: in the matrix with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and works a screening refrigerator, do not give up, but add to a matracy protector that you can easily buy and build.
Even if the maturity is currently produced in the whole area today, we will get two parts (for breathing and size of the sticks very important!), however, the manipulation of higher types (and on one person) can be manipulated by the filming of a slight weight in the ring with the hard.
Do you have a sandy board in the bed?
Never!
Maximum on bed for visits for one night.
Nevertheless, watch the table (if it is no longer) with the opening and use the matracy with a wheel bottle and a height of at least 15 cm with a wheel (with it.Taschenfederkern) and a cyprus level.
Polyuretan matrice does not belong to such a base.
On the non-containing lame rounds with 14 to 18 lameles will be suitable latex or sandwich matraces (the combination of latex and cococe), but you will be paid with a larger number of lameles, 28 and more, where the lamelines are doubled in beder and is possible to regulate their dust.
There is no matrace with a rubber bottle on the lamb's lambs, because they don't respond to the position.
During the setting of the tubes, it can also be able to be a bracelet.
It's a special capture of a lame that allows to swim, or even screw the lame, so that the ram falls quite "forbidden".
For men who have a "green throughout the back", it's very important.
Even the manufacturers of matraces who in "panish" began to use a mixing area right in the frame.
Women also remember - they are again weakening the surface in the places of kitchens.
For the most advanced clients are designed cross- or desticles, including multiturn breeding.
The pressure is exposed to more points and decreases the pressure.
Of course, when you use the right matrix and break a bad powder (a big and "induced"), the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the powder must support the head and the powder only to the rams so that the rams can be released.
As appropriate, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, for example in Skandinavia.
At the layer on the side, the powder should be equipped with the height of the brain with the ram of the branch or the mixed area in the matrace.
Modern matrace has a bunch of cocktails filled with grass, but just something common.
However, their manufacturers are still more frequently using natural materials or at least directly.
The trend was just at the maturity.
Seeds of polyuretan polyuretan powder are replaced by natural oil, such as spring and soja.
All known producers may use just soja.
"I was at the matrix means that the nuclear is made from the material purely natural powder," explains Peter Youršíček from the Tropico Plus company.
Natural substances are also used in the production of roads, one of the first was aloe religion.
But you can like microcapsules to be released by the boss or lendule's fresh wheat.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man "cooks" a vegetable extract from the breast to absorb the fat of matrace and cover the body, the women's throat "topy".
The extract from red papers increases blood circulation, so the weakest seed is the heat.
The favorite today?
Matrace produced from frozen dogs (small powers with a congestioned cell structure, is so bigger than a running polyuretan and offers better elasticity.
Combinations of different frozen dogs and "line" powder are the multi-zone matraces that are exactly able to be the head, the bedroom and the feet.
You're paying for the quality matracy from seven thousand corners and above.
Those who comply with health parameters, my=low DPH rate, are protected as health help.
As the first came in the Czech Republic to this Gumotex advantage.
It's not easy to look at the matracy and the wheat.
Sometimes it may be used for producers or sellers who offer two matrices at one price.
Maybe the Magniflex tag offers Duofre's matracy with all memory pounds of Mem's memo in the trail for 11 990 corners.
The other can be able to arrange free.
Ear of lines or viskoel-sticked dogs with open cell structure and high-speededness started with the "cosmic" template of Tempur material.
He rose as a NASA material, because at the beginning astronomy was made up to the beginning.
The temper is heavy, the cold is in the cold.
The heat of human body will be perfectly adapted and optimally exposed to its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal against the result of proliferation, but also to increase comfort in sleep.
Viscoelastic dogs are used not only for matrace, but also for health products, whether for special polyesters under the feet that reflect the feet and the grass system.
For example, foreign producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similarly.
Guess to watch people who wants more parents so they want to watch their children
The fear of your own child brings still more people to the idea of watch through GPS.
The system that is fully created to watch by cars can also follow the movement of people, thus helping in cases such as the destruction of the nine-year-old Anicky Janatk.
The device is still big as a box from the circle, soon, but it can only be large as hours.
Many people feared the case of the disappeared Anicky and started drinking after their children's ability to protect.
And for the price of their privacy distortion.
"We're trying to say to everyone that it's not about any spending, but about another thing to reduce the probability that it's going to be a tragedy," Peter Pilin from the Macro Weil company, which is one of the suppliers of checking equipment on the Czech market.
"I'll admit that in some case, it can come to disuse such equipment, maybe when they get to a person who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met with that case yet."
"The majority of these clients buy out of security debts," added Pilin.
According to the child, it should be used for what "cabine" serves and how it is used in the case of nausea.
The child psychologist Dana Bočkova warns that if the child wants to wear nothing like it, it's just going to be released.
"And very small kids show great creativity in how some things are acceptable to lose if they don't want to be under control."
"The great expectations were called before by the parents of the mobile, but they can be disabled as this tracking equipment," says the Botch.
It seems that it's awkward if such equipment would help in case of attack.
"When it's about the prepared income, the guard will make it practical -- that the child should not have any electrons that could cause his position."
"Now it's a phone."
"When they start expanding the tracking equipment, they will also look for them because their sale will certainly be supported by a mass of advertising."
"In that case, criminals will be going to step before the police," says the psychologist.
However, it advises that similar equipment can help in case of unnecessary pedofil attack.
According to Robert Czech from the RC Monitoring company, which offers research services both for cars and for persons, as well as when it comes to an immediate destruction of the tracking equipment, it can help his presence.
"The installation can be set up to regularly send the position after the expiry of certain periods."
"When it comes to his damage, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The lovers equipment have a building and a clonometer, so even if a man just locked and stayed unmounted to bed, it sends a device to warn immediately with a position," says the Czech.
According to similar service, smart mobile phones can also be carried out with navigation, where it is enough to load and special software.
The problem of current monitoring units is that it is either the similar device to the size of the box from the box or smaller mobile phones.
They always threaten their loss.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, it is now testing equipment looking like a running digital hour.
"This will have the greatest advantage of the case agressor doesn't need to know the tracking equipment."
"When she's known at the time and it can give the police time more," she adds.
Whether the monitoring equipment are already developed in boxes or sticks, they will continue to use the same § as it is used for the guarding of vehicles.
This is the combination of the GPS system's position detection (which uses running autonavigation) and the mobile phone that reports the current position of the vehicle.
The Army has a burning bridge that would be mocked in Czechland, but it's only two years.
The Czech Army purchased 445 miles of snow to burn the markets.
The Defense Ministry has already been added to 224 miles [224 km] snow funds.
The soldier has 225 years of resources.
The problem is that the duration of the snow is two, maximum four years.
The military bought burning shoes from the STV Group action, etc. for 40 million crowns.
The general ship in the purchasing of such a major quantity of MF DNES brands rejected that soldiers were 60 miles per year during the exhibition.
However, from the reports of military pyrotechniks that MF DNAs has celebrated, it shows that then a very intense pyrotechnical development should be processed annually, as well as all the generals, the majors of the military governance, secretarys, or clusters.
The Ministry of Defense of Alexandra Vondr and the military leader Vlastimila Pick doesn't take away.
That's just how it would be able to deal with the annual need for the army of sixty miles of fire.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if that was true, the military resources would be enough for more than ten years.
Instead, it would be paid that for the basic training of each new professional, at least two meters of burning wheels, as the experts say, the army made a pure purchase, and increased the need for gender or special units, the resources for 225 years mentioned.
The brigade soldiers of the brigade of the seat recently claimed that the Ministry of Wondro had no ships in hand weapons, so they were shoots because of the money's care.
I'm not talking about the lack of below.
"My head doesn't mean that we're buying so much of fires again."
"But it's their decisions, and they're sure what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom we as businessmen are trying to proclaim," says the business manager STV Group Jan Decky.
The Language Ministry of the Defense of Jan Pejšek deduces hundreds of miles of buyed bridges and the military will have the resources of this "monica" for at least ten years.
Yan Baby from STV Group, however, speaks only about the four-year livelihood of fire and police or military pyrotechnic even for two years.
"In the perfect storage, that can also be the four," says one of them, who as a soldier for the criticism of the army does not want to publish the name.
After the exposure of life, every munician must be tested carefully, whether it is still reliable and is not threatened by the soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not free, and they cost more money.
The additional argument of the Ministry is a number of 445 miles [445 km] of burning powder.
"We were standing about sixty per cent less than a lower delivery of two hundred and fourty-five miles," the Dutch speaker Pejšek statement of the Defense Ministers.
Only for comparison: Annual need for the burning rain of police pirotechniks, which eliminate municians from the Second World War or after the Soviet Army, has not exceeded a number of years.
And the police are negotiating only the quantities that this munician needs before the destruction of life.
It is evidenced for the safety of pyrotechniks, and it can also gain more moderate, and thus more flexible types of nitrogen.
The Ministry of Defense has a significant step today with the elimination of ten thousands of tonnes of munice from the time of Varsovia, when the twenty-third Czech Army was prepared for the seat to Rin.
This cheese, according to the pyrotechnicals that MF DNAS has celebrated, waits for a few years the same problem: it will eliminate hundreds of miles of old fires that "lacino" is buying today.
In this day, I've got a number of contacts that I've received by the competition.
The winning place in the competition The Year Life helped Luka Pytloun to sell his hotel franches.
The winner of the past year's competition of the Year's livestock became an eighty-year businessman Luke Pytloun from Liberce.
His story of success is like a film.
Luke Pytloun was traveling.
And in the neighborhood he realized that there is no quality apartment in Libercia for a reasonable price.
From the support of the banking brigade and using the bank credit, he bought a half-breaked house with five apartments.
That he was still a student of the third year of high school at that time, it was a great courage.
"Increasing attitude between quality and the price of housing with us, I didn't give me anything to try to do in this," says Luke Pytloun.
The reconstructed apartment began to find the employees.
Any winning invested from a house that gradually translated to a pen with 54 lips.
Since that time, in seven years of business, he had gradually been able to open four pens, two Restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity over 300 lifts of all housing category.
The most comfortable of them was added to the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
For years, but he got another, the same quality.
"We've just been signed with a hotel in the island of Tisé, where we sold our franshizing concept and other interesters on the French hotels of Pytloun with the report," says the loneal magazine number one.
"And on this sale of licence for the exploitation of a hotel, a large measure has shared just a victory in the competition of the Year's Victory," Pytloun added.
The victory brought him more knowledge and popularity in Libercia and the area.
"The people knew me in the streets, often welcomed me, and I need to say that it was pleasant," she said.
Participation in competition is decisively recommended to all who are trying to do something.
There's no need to win, every victory is good.
He says that there are some of the contacts and knowledge that may not be any otherwise.
"I started regularly negotiating with some of the people I met with the competition."
The honour associated with success, according to, has been so little to every employee.
And he's got them around 70.
"I watch more loyalty and honesty to them that they share in something that has gained general recognition."
"It's not far from my personal success, it's the result of the good work we all have."
"Only my name is spread before," says Luke Pytloun humbly today.
I want my representatives more calmly than we had in Farmet
Euphories from the winning of the crises were thrown out.
But because of the goal of winning, Farmet has worse time behind himself.
For the price for the first place in the last year competition of Vodafone Company in Slovakia, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žzhárski.
The report then assessed the effort of which he built from the small instrumental parts in the Czech Scale of the company with the stamionary operations.
"I can say that the evaluation has not only encouraged me, but all my cooperation and has increased our self-consciousness on competition," says a lower winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, he wanted to do something useful.
And so when the state offered to the father Karl Žár's to find a little dealer as a companion for a funeral party, he wasn't weakened, he refused the career in the company where he worked at that time, and with a few friends around his father found a company on plastic vans.
Soon they began to specialize on plant oil lists.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic lises in Central Europe.
Although the company had greater relations between the public, it was successful in the competition of media.
"Not only our clients started to embrace the pharmaceutical label very better, but also the partners began to appreciate that they cooperated with the company that has achieved success in their country," Karel Zjararski said.
However, the past year was not only in Farmet in the sign of eufori from winning.
Assessment has resulted from the economic results of the company to 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for sale of machinery goods.
The crisis that has not yet touched the citizens, but the companies have already stopped their investment projects and began to limit the purchases of new machines and machines.
"That's the way of us, of course, hasn't been dismissed."
"The claims were decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production, and it also came to leave," explains Karel Zjararski.
Lifetashop company must sometimes be able to make such non-annual measures.
But the situations were overcome and the company kept in profit, even if I was less than before the crisis.
However, from what they have not been removed in Farmet, investment in research and development.
"We made research and school centres, strengthened the presentation on international farmers, obtained the main assessment in the home exhibitions," says Zjararski.
Everyone convinces that the crisis is behind them.
The requests will grow again and with them and the number of new employees.
"I want a new victory a pleasant feeling of victory, but in the quietest atmosphere," Karel Zjararski says.
Analysis that removes non-sensitive rules
The year's absurdity review is a quarter part of business clothing.
Some insensitive rules have already been canceled.
With an unfair winning of the next year of Absurdita survey, the obligation of carrying out documents that are also available to officers online.
She decided over a third of four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested a paper expression from the business register, although the officer can receive it by two clicking on the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, it's gonna change it.
"The Czech Social Safety Administration has already expressed the business register in the controls of the payers to require adequately," said CSSZ Jana Buranj.
Congratulations to all the provisions and regulations that companies and businessmen in Czechland have to comply, and those unintentional to cancel them with the meaning of the competition of Absurdita in the year.
This is a number of fourth parts of the enterprise clothing organized by the Economic News and between the public is still more comfortable.
If the votes were voted about three thousand voters, they had been disappointed for four thousand years.
And there's no wonder, the most different legal obligations that serves only to maintain business, there's still enough and enough for us.
"It may be in the number of lessons for tax recognition we are at the front places of the world," recalls Karel Havlikk from the Association of Small and Central Business and Animals of the CR.
The simplification of enterprise has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, in comparison to the world, there is no improvement in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic placed on 74, which is about eight places worse than lone.
The competition of Absurdita was first announced in 2006 and each year runs according to the same scenario.
Approval administration and birocratic injuries may be every year from April to September when the conclusion of the concurrence.
To log in, the web address www.firmaroku.cz Then the complainant chooses seven candidates on "anticine" and allows it to vote publicly in October on www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.jned.cz.
Absurdita, which will get the most of the votes of winning.
More than a hundred, precisely 105 rules and Regulations for the purposes of the aircraft were notified in the annual review.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional unions and journalists.
The "finalists" consists of such a nominated experience, for example, of a request that vehicles for the maintenance of the remote and the lowways pay for lowly, or that employees with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets carry out each two years.
The list of aeroplane seven injuries is published on the sides of competition.
The statement of the concurrence which is held at the beginning of November in the Vaclav Place in Prague is part of the hapenning, which is regularly the personality of political and social life.
For example, for example, in this exhibition of concurrence, Eve Freedom, Director of the Association of Small and Mediterranean and Animals of CR or Peter Kužel, President of the Economic Community of CR.
"Hospital prosperity can't work where the home of businesses is a clocked under the feet, therefore it's my goal to cancel at least three decades of paragraphs that are simply complicating business today," Mr. Martin Kocourek reported to the industrial and trade minister.
It does not appear to be empty to break an insensitive regulation.
In 2007, the employer's obligation to report three days before the veterinary Authority in the place where the permanent operation is located, the purpose of going to the exhibition or delay.
This obligation was removed from the new animal law.
The second largest voted obligation in 2007, which was notified by the Office of work for its employee's service travel within 30 days, was removed by the law of such a green card.
And to the third of all the good.
In April 2009, fisiotherapeutics were made to have a large weight, a railway and two weights.
This has been dismissed in the year’s statement of the Health Ministry - the obligation to have a railway waste.
New category evaluates the Community responsible company
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sport projects are valued.
The news in the year of five years of competition of the newspaper is the category called The 2010 Responsible Company.
Sending this competition is a support for a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the impacts of their enterprise on life and support Communityly responsible activities," said Patrik Bartholdy, the regional mobile operator manager, the Vodafone company, which is a proclaimer and a guarantee of competition as in the case of the rebel of the year.
In the first year of this special subcategory, the main competition of the Vodafone Company in 2010 was notified by companies for which there was no success in the business for the only purpose.
The progress of each of them is very inspired and would give it to a single article.
Although the subject of its activities is different from one of the other diameterly, their joint names can be considered as a support and consideration.
In one case, for example, those affected, and otherwise personal problems or health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen whole-republical finalists, such as the Prague Software Society Et Netera, which supports the creation of non-formal sport teams between employees who then have a variety of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of the company responsible from Pardubian country is Isolit-Bravo, which is seventeen years ahead of the main contributor of the income fund sponsored in the handicaped child.
In the case of its health-related employees, the old paper from Pobebrad has more than 70 percent, so it obtained the title of the Responsible Company of the Central Country and in the competition of Vodafone Firma of the year was located in the country as a third.
On Olomo·ku, the MiRyz Soft company, which has introduced the work period, also reduced at a average of 35 hours a week, but without a relatively reduced payment.
The Title also granted its report that it was primarily purchasing from the Czech producers, supporting citizen activities in the nearby environment and in the surface of life.
"We are trying to recycle the most of our business and administratively," explains Milushe Ryznar's actor.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Usteck country again thinks of the health of its employees and has assigned them to each notebook, supporting their work from home and using the catering services provided by local protected part.
"In addition, we support the opinion of a man in the tissue that helps specifically the local community of Rome," says the representative of the company of Ondraj Succi.
In the meantime, it is also a change in the activity of Prania and cleaning from the Carlovar country that contributes to their employees in the form of superstandard bonuses to their pension accommodation.
"We rebuild our contributions to feed, transport, increased ability and recreation," Joseph Stra’č says from the Bruntal Czasch building company, winning in Mo’s Scosland.
In the Category of the Annual Responsible Company, all national finalists of Vodafone Company were automatically notified, who answered the questions of the applicant added to the register and sent it to the latest of August 15.
Incorrect or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were then issued from the evaluation agent.
"When the representatives of the competitive company did not answer the question, they could not participate in the Competition of the Responsible Company, but they were not discovered from the "hla" competition of Vodafone Firma of the year."
"The consensus is not possible only in this competition because it's a subcategorie of the main competition of the company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose's officer.
In the Plzni Police's Territory Fund, she was at the public competition.
In the Construction of the Agricultural Fund in Plzni last days, the anti-coruption police attacked.
The iron of the detectives set the local business officers in the Media Sfera and businessers with the realities of Luboschi G.
It was evidently attempted to manipulate the public concurrence for refunds so that the land offered in concurrence would receive specific interesters.
He had to pay half a million crown for that.
"Now I can only confirm that the police is a person who is in the overcome of the public prosecution and in the public concurrence," said the President of the Plain State Representative of Antonia Greenna, saying that more details about the current investigation could not be provided.
The sixty-five-year police officers left for freedom after 24 hours.
The way public concurrence could be affected is only to speculate the minimum official information.
The Talk of the Foreign Fund of Lubomira Black on the Question Preva stated that they were attracted at a divorced work in the Plzni Policies, and that during the public concurrence.
"It was about a client, neither of our employee," she said.
The public concurrence, according to Black, has the right name of the "Appeal to grant a proposal for transmission of lands in accordance with the ground law" and is concerned when the proposed land is interested in more authorised applicants.
"These persons shall offer a higher value of their refund refunds to be made by the transfer before the land value was declared."
"By the proposed proposals, the orders are set out by the purchasers and the Territory Fund will then transfer the territory to the person who offered the highest debt," explained the speaking fund.
Luboš G., obviously, had information about who has been registered in the challenge, and because it is also authorised by the person, because he has spent a number of refunds, he offered the interesters to the land that it is not involved.
It was evidently incaused.
It would explain that he had so much money in holding.
Luboš G. had superstandard contacts on PF in Plzni in the past.
He figured in the case of an ex-Cheef PF Václav Sankota, who was penaltyly tired of the refund of the land, which was already issued by the decision on the location of the building.
At that time, Luboš G. received from the Fund, for example, the lands intended to establish public communications, specifically in the place where the income magistrates were to be built into the Bursk area.
Po·ii has changed them very advantagefully with the magistrate in the historical center of the city, which had a much higher value.
Then she had to join it, because otherwise it would be threatened by blocking the building areas.
Capitality pays hundreds of monthly residences
The households will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy but also for water and cost, warm supply and somewhere to grow.
The family will have to get out of money from January to hundreds of corners monthly more than now.
Electricity delivers up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more lower than 10 percent in some cities you will have to pay for water supplys, and many of them also undertake the leverage of the central heat.
The delivery of electricity should be home in the apartment for each year on the road of stocoruine than now.
The prices of power electricity, however, were reduced by all the main suppliers, thus the significant increase in energy production support from renewable resources, especially photography.
Although the gas produces quietly, but at the time when people are the most tough and have the greatest need.
So, annually, it must also be counted by hundreds of crowns more.
While electricity and gas produces throughout the Republic, the change of the prices of central exhaust is different from the place.
Increasing prices are mainly planning foreigners.
For example, the household in Pardubians or the Royal Kings will pay from January for a central exhibition of about 50 crowns a monthly more, and more than 1000 crowns per year will pay the family in Libercia.
The people of Prague are again threatening that more than 9 per cent of water and cost, in the case of increased towns from the infrastructure.
If it doesn't change, it's going to pay 6,8 percent.
However, the price in Praza will remain in the whole Republic of lower comparison.
On the north of Czech, where the prices already belong to the highest, it has a water and assets of 7,4 percent.
For example, the increase of the price of the payment in 450 thousand rental apartments, where the regulation ends since January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, who is owned over Labem over about 2500 apartments, wants to increase up to 100 percent from January.
Those who agree with a new higher deal will be able to give a court company.
Regulated resources payable to people in approximately 300 thousand apartments could grow up to 10 percent next year.
Czech kids are covered by fernet and rum. The beer is from mode, it is quietly.
Fernet, room, water, exceptionally and better whisky whisky stolen to parents.
These are the drinks after which the drinks are most often finished in the care of the doctors of a drink that have not yet been 15 years.
There are no kids who are treated in the hospital repeatedly.
This results from the experience of doctors who met similar cases in the receipts of children’s disease.
"No bird or wine are absolutely unnecessary, because it takes it before you drink them."
"Trendem is certainly a strong alcohol," he reported the Right Primary of the Child Hospital Hospital in the Mediterranean Czech Luddak Pelikán.
"When they get out of the box, it's a whisky, but it's overflowing the fernet and the water."
"Wody has the benefit of it to joke her into the juice and then it doesn't feel so much," explained the prime.
And for the truth, he also gives him Motol Eva Jurin.
"The most often it's fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in basic schools."
"In some cases, it was about the slip that they brought out of the house," Jurin said.
According to the principles of Pelikan, thirteen or fourteen years of drinking on the disease receipt are relatively running evidence.
Before horror, where he worked since the year, he worked ten years ago on the pediatry in Motole, where healthy schools are counted out of a wide environment.
"One girl lies at us about four times."
"The carrier started in 12 years when it was brought to us with 3,5 promile alcohol in blood, in combination with extase," the doctor described particularly a serious case.
"They were at the show in Holishvic on a dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother hasn't come especially that she didn't know about her daughter 48 hours," he's surprised.
I just don't care for parents or even their significant tolerance to drink their own generations is considered as the main cause of growing children's drinking.
However, it is not possible to speak about the dependency in the true word of meaning, according to the experts in children.
"Unless alcoholic is a few-year chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomenons that belong to it, and that's not in the child."
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is more significantly unspecified family-social background," explained the principle of Pelikan.
According to the speaker of Jurin’s year at the pediatric clinic in Motole, the hospitalization of about 40 kids were hospitalized until the half November.
However, only those with hard toxicity will have to stay in the hospital.
Children's birds, who take their parents after ambulant treatment, are in case they're transporting a police home, they're not counted anywhere.
In addition to the cases where children are just sitting at school and drinking a rubber, there are three seasonal trainings based on Pelikan: the chairman, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"It's whether they're singing for a bad statement, or they celebrate the beginning of a empty day."
"In fact, I lived on the board of the chair and the seven child drinkers once," Pelikan advised.
The drinker who takes the night of detoxication under the supervision of the doctors is paradoxally forgiving the one who suffers an inappropriate cocovine on the second day at home.
Increasing inflammation of the heads caused by dehydration and the lack of glucose, the inflammation infuses with glucose and animals missing by the body.
"They're actually better for it, because they're having a beautiful dinner and a good wake, and they're nothing worried."
"There are only confusions from where they are," Pelikan admitted that sometimes he will dismiss the patient's pleasure at least the number of costs that their treatment requested.
The transport of health and hospitalization on the acute cow will also come out for tens of thousands of corn.
"I sometimes applied it as a student when I recalled exactly those kids then at the visit how many of them were, and that they could also work all the year on the brigade to work for the one dinner," added Pelikan.
However, health insurance in accordance with regression procedures in which parental treatment costs would not be accessible in cases of child drinkers.
Two airports L-159 are first in other hands in Spain
Two airports L-159 of the total five cows, for which the Czech Defense Ministership changed the transport airport Casa C-295M, went to the Spanish Sevilla, where the airport manufacturer Casa - EADS sits.
It's the first thing that the machines of this type appeared in the property of someone else than the Czech Armies.
In the neighborhood, they were only in the practices or preliminary years.
It is a double version of L-159T1, which has already operated the Czech Army and which has been aircrafted.
The remaining three machines are only L-159.
These are then reserved in Aeru Vodochoda and the business officer - Omnipol - has taken them last week.
When flying from Vodochod, there is no known according to Jana Pejska from the Defence Committee.
"The only L-159 airports for exchange were collected from the time of the aircraft, without other income and investment from the resort of the Ministerial Ministry."
"Double-local L-159T1 were changed in the current state and image," said the Right Pejschek.
He added that the military would not remain without two-looking airports because the Ministerial Ministry signed in May 2009 with Aer Vodochoda with a value of 200 million crowns to the conversion of four unnecessary machines L-159 to two double machines.
One new airport took the army in July, the second moves to the end of the year.
According to Pejska, the EADS claimed that the airports would go into the arms of some alian countries.
"You are noted that the L-159 airport is EADS and will serve for the production of pilots from the NATO country."
"These are things that take away how this thing will be accomplished," Peachek said.
The Hospital Journals previously stated that, for example, the Spanish Army of L-159 does not care.
Five L-159 for one airport Casa and purchase of three other years in 3.5 billion crowns approved by the Government of Mirk Topolanka.
The Ministry of Defence has not been invoked on the purchasing of the election procedure and directly celebrated the EADS.
The current defence leader argumented that changes will support the future export L-159 to the replacement.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aera and used only 24, the rest would want to sell.
Casa's air buy will probably have a courtyard.
However, the European Commission, the Czech Ministry of Defence, has committed the European Court because the aircraft should be chosen on the basis of a European tender and never to celebrate one producer.
The military has already taken three Casa years, the last should come to Kbely's busy airport during fourteen days.
Longer indicator than the fingerprint means lower risk of cancer
Men who have indicators longer than fingerprints are underlying the less risk of illness cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of the study that the British Cancer magazine published in the middle.
It can be related to the human hormone of testosteron.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingerprint can serve as a simple test of the risk of cancer cancer, especially for men up to 60 years," stated a joint study of Rose Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The fingerprint could thus be helped to determine who men should test the cancer, especially in combination with genetic risks or other dangerous factors such as family health care, added Eeles.
During 1994-2009, more than 1500 patients with cancer cancer followed over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the studies had indicators on the right hand shorter than the fingerprints.
She paid for them the same probability of the race cancer as for 19 per cent of those whose fingers were the same longer.
However, in the case of those who had an indicator longer than the fingerprints, this risk was decreased by 33 per cent, for men to sixty had even reduced 87 per cent.
The proportion of the length of two mentioned rings - established in a prenatal period - obviously reflects the different levels of seminar hormones which the child is built in the work.
Less than testosteron corresponds to the longer indicator.
Earlier research showed that the testesteron just supports the growing cancer of prostitution.
Previous Czech Genetic and former President Academy Professor Václav Paches for ČTK said that he knows quickly about this study, but it does not seem to him that the relationship between the long fingers and the cancer would be "completely shown".
Czech is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czechland, like Europe's area, is covered by snow on Thursday.
On the streets and roads, the snow is stuck, and the travelers have passed throughout the night.
The distance D5 is closed between 89. and 93.km in the direction of Rozvadov for some accidents of cost and personal cars, and D1 is also at Brna in the direction of Prague.
The newspaper said that the UAMK Officer of the Central Car Club (UAMK).

There's a few miles of columns.
It's also a accident on the D11 remote, and it's just at the arrival to Prague.
In Praza there are a few meters of snow, the temperatures show at least seven degrees of Celsia.
For example, the car columns are created in Prosecu, also the Sterboholska.
The best transport hedge is metro.
Tramways are driving later, for example, on the trail between Karl's destination and the Mirror.
The eighth is going to sit on the Prague Crisis Board again.
The problems are also affected by railways and aircraft.
The Czech roads have already been broken for snow to break seven rubber connections.
The problems, for example, have a trace from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
The traveler should control the current performance.
The Russian airport was closed from the middle 11 hours a night to five to five.
Most of the roads to the south Moravia are already coincidenced, but only increasing care.
In Scotland, there are three outside roads, the places for snow languages in Britain and in Blanc need to make some communications at the high places of the snow line.
The most achieved places belonged to Scotland.
Now there are closed paths: Rusínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Milešo.
They're gonna have to put a frequency in their protagonism.
When they are transferred, they can't be checked yet.
Hodonin needs attention in the White Carpats.
In the streets held there for the protection of the nature only by the inert movement, there is the CTK to five meters of snow.
In Czechland, two to ten meters of snow fell mostly in North Czech, often to 18 meters.
In Mo’s Coastland, some 15 meters of snow attacked.
Snow in Czech is progressive.
American soldiers have a new "fast weapons"
The American Army set a new "fast" weapons in Afghanistan, known only under the XM-25 code label.
Generals hope that a new automatic weapon or dark conflict with Taliban and "changing game" in their benefits.
The new weapon is something like a little super-speaking work.
Its projects are the lazer with precision for a few meters.
The special rate of 25 mm, developed for this gun and containing a high-explosive marketing, actually works as small granates.
The ships can be programmed so that they will explode not only when they go to the goal, but at any point their balistic roads.
It can therefore be used against the enemy who is hidden by the wall, the wall, or in the grave.
Sora is usually not protected, and when a murdered rain of oil pigs up to it, it can make it out of the battle.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the XM-25 development, it is a new gun for the first weapons that uses "speed".
"The boy with her is in principle so that he finds the goal, sends him a laser paper, which determines the distance, gets a determined target point, according to which he adjusts the proposal and makes the cocktails."
"Let's say you've spent 543 meters."
"When you press the puzzle, the weapon will get up and switch up a 543 metres away plus minus one, two or three metres," Audette said.
Switch to 400 workplaces
The Concern of Fujits moves his bathroom from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their job in July next year from the successful administration of the building in the city of Marienbader in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Concern of Fujits moves his bathroom from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.

The offer was very attractive and large space officers in Astro Park in a greater way to gain work in the way of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujits was just in charge.
The competent agent Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central seat in Frankfurt-Nederrad with an outstanding infrastructure."
Excellent flight connection is very important for global society such as Fujits.
The recent movement of an important undertaking in the region has been called for joy in winners and disappointment in the deceased.
The main economic reporter in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this has been able to get a global player.
It's a fantastic demonstration of confidence in this place.

"Of course we offered our help to the company," Corwis said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not be changed by the computer manufacturer with the finder of freedom in Marienbader.
In the outcome, the economic divisions were decided.
Now it's about to prevent long noise in such a prominent place.
"I hope he will be the owner and finder of the building cooperate."
The house of Rathaus, which later used Fujits, and the neighbors "Cleine Vertical" were ten years ago with the remaining buildings in Marienbader place to the most discouraged building purposes of the city of Lacena.
In the middle of trailers and advocates, the joint project of the city and the private projector, etc., was criticised by the mass of the floor, which previously served as a park, and also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001 the investment advice and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the manufacturer of the computers of Fujits, which was still connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujits received in 2006 together Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Grupe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and were sold by Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokia is marked as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers, for example, a computer and server company available and also cares about a needed service.
The bathroom in Rina and Mohana is one of the biggest in Germany, most employees of Fujits is in Mnich.

Amazon disables the server - Assangem's counterparts
Wikileaks gets in trouble.
Amazon's Internet service has disabled the discovery platform on its servers.
It is likely that the political pressure has occurred after publishing the statistics of secret diplomatic depths.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is detailed in Great Britain.
Wikileaks, the discovery platform, is still under pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their successful home server in America and are now looking for the Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and businesses to fight Wikileaks.
And the founder Wikileaks Julian Assange, leading on the list of searched Interpols, must be maintained according to one newspaper in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free demonstration in the country of freedoms," they reported active publication by the service of short news of Twitter in the middle (local time).
Soon before, the Amazon Internet company continued Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used to publish secret diplomatic depths of Amazon Web Service (AWS) to enable a high number of access to documents.
The Twitter service explained Wikileaks to this step: "Fain - our dollars now we lose by employing people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with free demonstration, "but they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of his servers for Wikileaks after the work of Senator Joe Lieberman, the CNN TV station was published on the basis of the Liverman office information.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Defence of the House threatened Amazon with a boykot, informed the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to approach this step before, in view of the previous publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
Liverman invited the rest of the countries to protect its platform in the use of servers.
"Wikileaks one illegally, irrespectively and independently, and that is our national security which is a danger and threatening life on the whole planet," said one declaration of the non-lateral senator.
"None of the responsible company - either American or Zawinski - shouldn't help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
The founder Wikileaks Assange, who is searched for the Swedish authorities for suspiciousness of violence, is on the list of searched Interpols.
On the basis of the reports in the London newspaper The Indiat, the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist marked investigation in Sweden because of its intrigues against the persons.
The speaker Wikileaks Christinn Hrafnsson in London said that it had been too to be injured.
"The challenges were even the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is rightly afraid of his security, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously responsible for the announcements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Guardian Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested to be responsible for the publication of Wikileaks for the consequences of accusation and correction.
In Canada, one adviser of the Government of Stephen Harper said in television - an ironic pattern, Assange should be killed and Obama could use "the target airport".
Meanwhile, the white house and Assange were split.
The Language President of Barack Obamy, Robert Gibbs, called "smiley and absurd" that Assange requested a delay in ministerial service for Hillary Clinton, if it was responsible for recently published Spanish challenges to diplomates.
"I'm not sure why we're interested in the view of a man with web pages," said Gibbs.
"Our business policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its websites."
The American Government is currently aware of the safety of its databases.
The special confidence was appointed by the representative of the Centre for Anti-Terrorist measures, Travers, who shared the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "needs refores in the structure" which are necessary after publishing messages from sending to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American Government also noted that he wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they should be in danger for the publication of Wikileaks.
"We gave everything, and we got contact with them," said the speaker of the Ministry of Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if it was necessary."
Small University
For "Gelato" in Bologna, the sugar sugars are prepared for a better year period.
The basic course for the future whispers, which takes three days, is a great interest and visitors come from the world.
Where do you really get that whistle?
From Gelatari and from Gelataio.
Gelatier, Czechish a little old whisper, makes a crown according to all the rules of the Italian whisper artificial art.
Gelataio produces a wheel from the cold box, puts it into the sale and sells it.
To do this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to learn more about the wound, he doesn't escape the "Gelato-University" of the Italian Carpigiani company.
In 2003, the manufacturer of frozen machines designed a maturity university to comply with the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which takes three days, is a major interest and visitors come from the world.
It also offers a number of days of special chocolate disorder and practice in its own wound.
Someone wants in his Midlife-Crisis after a new career, others takes care of the fat ice of their unexplained complaints.
This time it is 40 people from 19 countries of all the worldwide - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, artist of California, loves the Slow-Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business conquest, and she wants to start something own after years of stressing work.
Two young Egyptians are dreaming that they will open the wound in Cairo.
One man from Malty and one of Brazil wants to improve the quality of the wounds in their bars - and the Canadian woman in the house of Julia, because her children love the Italian wound.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the ideal properties of perfect wounds.
The decisioner is not just a good pleasure, but also a heavy heb and a good consistence.
Luciano will not forget during his school at the Southern and ownership trigger on the garden: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it belongs to a novel romantic dose."
By the stage of production it seems to be simple.
Luciano puts the basic provisions of milk, lac, milk, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixer, which burns all with 85 degrees of the electronic program and then immediately looks at four degrees.
Then it turns on a cowhotch machine and gets a pasterized white basic crown, based on all kinds of milk grass.
The expert is immediately questioned: Is it possible to produce soil only from natural substances without stabilising?
How can a man experiment himself?
Luciano's warning, let the spirit go to a stranger.
He who speaks of the frog "only from natural proselytes", apparently also used stabilisers - the most natural product, such as the guarr mosque of guarrine.
Of course, it is possible to produce grass, even without stabilisers, but it must be sold during one day, elsewhere, and the applicant has its own ice cow.
Certain variations of basic weight are allowed.
It's gonna be more aromatic.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes in the cocktail of frogs according to the adjunction that is bought in the supermarket or in the fruit-section or in the sugar section.
Moreover, there are powder and crops.
"The suppliers will try to introduce a lot of aromatized provisions."
"You should just experiment."
Be with fruitful sorbits with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or they're weakened from a white basic weight that changes the cups to the yellow crown and cocain based on all chocolate trials.
Now the highest currency for the wheel machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanil, chocolate, coffee and liscoory frozens - or with a sheep or without them in a basic material, with more or less vanyl aromat or other natural provisions.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit species of frog.
More aromatic substances, more fruity pyre - because of cut it is not better.
Lisco-orrhears don't need to cut more oil when it contains more olive oils.
The most favorite mixture of kiva will produce a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Once the mixed mixture is raised up the right whisper of Gelato, Luciano says.
The wheel is a clear number of tasks: If bross pire is used with a lot of sugar, the part of the sugar must be reduced in the basic receipt.
In citrons, additional sugar portion needs.
Luciano provides a device to determine the contents of sugar in fruit (in this case, winners measure the brass of gross).
Congratulations make the numbers easier.
The vibrator doesn't require so many body weights as before.
It does not only help the device for automatic production of the basic weight.
There is also a device that makes a ready mixture mixed in the cream and looks for a minimum temperature.
Even though we're automatically out of little accidents, we're not going to get out.
Brazilian Gustavo will also swallow himself and his colleagues off to the bottom of the fruity pirae when a major mixer is locked out of control.
"In each course," Maestro Luciano believes, "is just a question of time when something like this happens."
Revisors in two Lights
The European Food Authority of the EFSA is conducted with a progress experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now stated a group of experts of Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institution for bio-evaluation.
"It sounds like a spiklenic theory, but we have documented it well," said Christoph then in the middle of Mnich's testbiotech.
The leader group of Efsa experts for genetic changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and the other expert Efsa has been a few years with the link of Ili lobisti.
It's financed by concerns such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in a decided way in the Ephes' control rules for genetic plants and thus stands in the centre of interests, then criticizes.
The provisions of the EFSA shall be agreed in all paragraphs with the Illi documents and thus carry out a copy of the future which should be controlled by the Authority of the Italian Parma.
It's already the subject that testbiotech warns about the screen of interests.
Recently, a high manager from Ephesus has passed without any time or transition to the Swiss Agricultural Concern Syngenta - and thus has changed the parties.
The vote for the Mediterranean (MDR) has also recently discovered the EU-Agency's personal connection for the control of industrial lobby, which has encouraged the interests of the Ministry of Life Affairs and the EU-Mitglied.
Meanwhile, Efsa can't break interests.
It works with all series of data, thus those in the future, if they are highly professional, are listed in one declaration.
The experts who work for Epheses do not require that they don't have a contact with the future.
But he needs to add them.
Kuiper recognises his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is only marked as an neutral forum of experts from the world, the industrial and policy - other than for the risk of biodiesel without lobby.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that the genetic genetics are currently allowed to change plants in animals without any attempt to feed, and that genetic plants are not reacting to the effects of life-life.
"We want to figure out what, for example, will make geneticly changed kitchen on the field," he says.
The current practice is only testing isolated whitecoats and not all the genetic plants, which does not coherent results.
"If they don't look for a risk, how would it be possible to find them?", he asked a complaint then.
That agrees with Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientist worker has examined the gender since 1994 and currently works at the Technical High School in Curych.
In this Ireland, the future is trying to be as well as in the United States, and now in Europe is still more influenced or discredited by critical agents.
Therefore, there are almost non-existents that would not be associated with the concern.
Most of them do not publish studies that are critical for companies.
"Progress controls security research," Hillbeck believes.
Stone Tray
Uli Gsell also arranged a lot of 400 pounds.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of the shopping in Stuttgart, the tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It's snow.
The event is known: In September, the bags were taken and started to keep a big northern wheel.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands were demonstrated against S21, a billion reduction.
When the building was stopped, the wheel was lying.
Divorced by 6000, 7000 cuss.
A warrior from the airway, a milk tomb stone that was used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell's a companion in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of these kitchens.
"These stones are relicive."
"I can't lose."
"The league and poor stone, simple and purple."
When one was thrown, he smoked the cigarette's fuck.
I don't know what's going to do with those kitchens yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The stone stage from Stuttgart leads to the forest by Tübingen to the former deponition of the French armies, where Manuel Rongen built his stone river.
The 44-year-old man handles old stones.
He bought everyone who came up during the fighting in Stuttgart.
"It would be an accusation if they were thrown on a cup or disappeared on a deponition," he says in her office, a tree building that was previously watching house.
They say they gave him and threatened him when in September all the newspapers he was buying the rest of the north wheel from the company that carries democracy.
But he's talking all the days with S-21.
And he explained to them that democracy can't be done.
And when it's going to happen, it's the most understanding when the stones continue to use.
Then it took about 200 S-21-contrasts each one about 80 kilograms a hard block, a price for 6,50 to 14 euros.
Like a whisper, some also believe that they will return it to the re-exposition.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cost of 25 large cost cars.
Maybe half is still in the forest, the rest has been selling a long time.
Guests, national gardens, home builders.
They came from all the corners and dropped what happened to the cube and to the prize.
The stones of a band from Stuttgart have been changed to "shirts" or as the areas of ships.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If there wasn't that political witch."
He's sitting in his territory car and going to a car after his 20th hectare kingdom.
He was studying before the law, the study interrupted, the biography, then he was interested in computers, and finally became a trader with stones.
And the lovers of stones.
It's 40,000 tons of stones.
He's counting his resources from all Germany.
He says he's the biggest businessman with the old stones in the Republic.
It's a spring.
The snow is located by artists made of songs.
"One looked at Marien-most in the Sardinian," he said.
The song from Labe, yellow, heavy, heavy.
"My favorite stone."
Let's go on the way up through the forest.
It shows on the rock: red sandwich, first part of the carlsruhe.
Come on.
"Screen travery."
Once the quarters were the tribe of Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow is stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police president in Stuttgart, the red granit from the temple Sankt Blasien, from the hospital in Heilbron.
What a job, what a travel, what a road.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were spread manually and transported by simple cartridges and ancient transports, it will become honest.
"It would be a scandal if something like that would be crazy."
He wasn't a rich, very rich, no longer.
Today, but a traveler employs 14 people, and besides it, stones in the forest were placed, one coacher, one bowl, one screen, and one garden.
"We're working firmly, but it's satisfying," says the one who appreciates the rest.
It's got to go to Colona at the time.
They'll save the stones there too.
Battle of talents for High-Potencies
It's a lot of people in the divorce.
16 students are pressured in breast-feeding bottles, raisiness and sweetness.
The Technical University in Braunschweig and the manufacturers of the cars Volkswagen invited students to workshop machinery and design.
With the VW developers here, they have to talk about the car of the future - and soon to know the Volkswagen outside.
A lot of fires are trying to make the most smart heads, as well as VW firms, spending and co-operating with universities.
Their missions are: What may be recruited first in listeners the most hopeful solutions, even before they get to the market work and others will be interested in them.
Since university does not show any list of successful successes of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in projects oriented to practice and get them.
TU Braunschweig is trying to get talents on the second day.
One young lady from the personal division divides the rubbers, gummeds and boards with VW logs.
It relates to young talents on practical programs, student employment and indicates their ways to the concert.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of a project with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "The students will contact the future and get experience."
"WW can know students at the same time, draw close to interesting candidates and think who would be a partner."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, isn't unusual.
The news, but it's that it's so openly fighting for students.
"Jinak was more important professional project," says Selle.
It's probably still stronger for the war of the sincere solutions.
In many sectors, companies cannot choose their employees from the long-term representatives of refugees.
Instead, it must try and strive to enlarge specially highly highly agitated work of force.
In addition to the solution of the Engineering Rooms, there is a excellent negotiation position.
According to the VDI German engineers' data, 40,000 engineers remained in October.
And according to VDI, the lack of engineers still grows.
For the KPMG auditing and advisory company is Roman Dy's fishing talents.
Organizes the accurate recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern construction of stocks in which the operators must find a path according to the GPS coordinate.
The company plans next year to send such eight promised students to the United States.
Participants can equivalently view the KPMG and contact the company.
Before it is decided in two choice rounds who will take place.
Only Crème de la Crème from many aeroplanes to the United States.
In the fight on High Potentials at universities, they will pay more laws according to Dykty.
"We want to distinguish us with our Race from the last."
"Only a driving trip on the platelet was too small for us."
It seems that the lobbyer of the talents of Dy has happiness.
"We've stayed in contact with all the similar actions in the past year."
"There are some who will finish the study soon and plan to take care of our job," he says.
In addition to direct campus celebration with particularly small and medium-sized companies present classic on the work markets.
"We're trying to contact solvents on professional exhibitions."
"E.g. on Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, leader of the personal Department of Solar Technology Productor Solarworld.
Bonna's company works in Germany about 1500 employees.
He knows the problem with young jobs.
Currently, 35 places are written on the websites of the company.
"In the present time it's just complicated to occupy free spaces."
"They're a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contacting professionals at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with different high schools, such as a university in Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible for us to practice or write diplomatic work."
The solar specialist does not organize any nice advertising action.
Instead, the company is trying to make other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchie and easy communication.
"The big concerts are often unable to offer it," says the leader of the Stübe's personal department.
When searching for work, money is not playing the main role.
Flexible work;time, children's observation or good procedure options are other decision-making factors.
Solarworld was in one study of the Great Place Institute in the 55th place between 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute shall set up an annual list of the best German employees.
Furthermore, the cooperation of workers is questioned about the satisfaction of their work and employment and follows the employees' submissions.
The leader of the Staübe personal division hopes that her location will bring points to the employees for work.
"I think the interesters are particularly informed about the external assessments of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Re日 Warler from German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good news strategy as employee.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means particularly internal measures.
"The best way to see as an attractive employer is going through his own employees," he says.
This is professionally called the Internal Employer Branding, so the marketing of employees in their own employees.
"The pleasure of employees is the best explanators."
When the company cares well about his people and they identify themselves with the company, then they will make their employee publicity between friends and known ones.
"It's like a game with a driving," says Kriegler.
Obama stops the new jardins
During the following years, they will not occur before the province of the United States of Florida in the Mexico village of a new bourgeois.
The Government in Washington has issued a corresponding prohibition - and that has cancelled the final validity of the previous plans.
Before Atlantic circles, new gardens are still banned.
Inside Minister Ken Salazar reported it in the middle.
D2: a deep prohibition to pay at least five years in the following, is the explosion of the garden "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this unfortunately, one-thirds of the lives and leaded to the greatest disaster of life in the United States, President Barack Obama signed on opposition and his desire to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Mexican village.
This is how the staff are trying to reduce the dependency of the United States on the surgery of an alien.
It is not clearly explained to today who takes responsibilities for the destruction of the oil grave in the field.
The middle of criticism is the British Energy Concern BP, which is confronted with billion requests.
The Research Committee, which Obama believed, should present outcomes during the Office.
In October, Ken Salazar rejected the prohibition of return from the explosion.
Thereafter, different concerns have been given to request for new garden purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prohibit similar disasters by more urgent controls and strict security rules.
At present, the control authority is mainly reformed, which has been warned of many corruption accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would distort the lucrati – the possibility of tax income for gas and gas concerns.
The progress now openly warns that more urgent regulations are mainly decreasing the volume of the weight of greenhouse.
"The government's plans are the greatest wind for the growth of gas and electricity," it sounds the result of the current investigation in the BDO advisory company - still before the prohibition of return in the middle.
The American Energy Alliance is still trying to do so in the range, "Nobody knows exactly what regulations will change."
Investment in new weight projects will be moved to the revocation - to growth.
The area of Ogoni was cut off
The water in the rivers is olive hedge, it cooks it like the pumps: billion litres of unclean ropes destroyed the nature of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption, and illegal throat.
Celestine Acpobari thinks well.
"Don't touch you," calls the ecological activist, "only you're going to get an objectivity too long."
The Nigerian 37 - year - old Nigerian tried to photograph the boy who is shiping by the finger of the water that surrounds the woods: this scene acts in the water woods with rare colors almost to beautiful.
It's not that it's under the surface of the blue neck of the throat, it's not to see.
Earlier, she gathered to us enough garnel, she told Esther Badom at the top of the River Bodo-Jetty.
Meanwhile, the fluid water became quietly dead.
Five years ago, a large quantity of floods came into a great wave from the diluted lead.
Fishers from the nearby town Bodo must fall at least six hours to get into the water where fish are:→ Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger River's heart belongs to one of the worst seased pigs in the world.
The road after the river Mangro·k’s beaches with many sides are just a significant whole range of launch.
The engine on the bowl takes the place of the lightwater, and whoever stumbles his hand into the water, the fingers will go out.
Mangro's roots come from the land as black cycle of the medicine, rarely the painting is allowed to whisper their arrows.
We are marriedly looking for birds, which are currently present in the wheels: When the engine hits the fucking engine, it's in the earlier, where it's like a pump, a terrible silence.
"What happens here is the ecological leading of the war," Celestine Akpobari said, "We live in a permanent fear of health."
Comparison with war is authorised.
The area of assemblement of Ogoni is a field where a number of decades has been fighted: over 60 years ago, the first purchasers of Europe were included here, here was the first retraction in the 80s of the year, with Ken Saro-Wiwa writer, here has been to stop Shell's production in 1993, because it was very dangerous for employees.
Today, the company should not return to Ogoni: while the whole part of the three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 weighty gardens and 7000 km leading more than two million black gold bars, the field is located in the Ogoni ship, for the concern is very sustainable.
Each hundreds of meters are covered from the water of the ocean’s ocean as bizarre socks: "Nighty Trees", so it is very nearly called the heads of the garden opens.
They're 50 years old, they're increasing to the sea.
Each minute, such a head of the garden opening will be broken, he tells Akpobari, and then the constant spring of the rocks go into the water.
According to the estimates of experts, the ecoseem was in part more than two billion litres for 50 years: Each year, the quantity of rubbers that came into the sea at Alaska at the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" havary 21 years ago - one of the biggest life-life catastrophes in the history of mankind.
They're aware of who's responsible for the continuing environmental disaster.
While the concern Shell marks the sabotage and organised clay of the rope for more than 90 percent of the destruction, the life-life protector speaks about the wounding heads of gardens and injury guides as the main cause.
Shell requires in Nigeria much less security rules than in the world's usual, ordered a concern in 2008 in the US-American Richard Ste: Only the quantity of driving broadcastings is likely "newly higher than else".
In the place that looks out of the distance as leaved, the oil split down under the wide sky, it will be made out of the mangroufics of the position: they are completely nazis and up to the oil.
Under one of the many courts that are partly associated with the lead, partially libovolously disrupted on the ground, fire burns: illegal small raffinery.
The robe is burning over fire for a few hours, explains Michael, the leader group.
Before he gets out of leading to a fair benzine ring, puts the cap at the end of kerosin management and finally the oil.
In this way, Michael and his four co-operators every day to four courts after 300 litres: "We're making 34,000 Naira" -- about 22 dollars.
The population of the parts is using the chronic lack of powder weight in the largest country of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffinery.
A mixed low price of EUR 40 cents per litre of oil can still be killed by illegal producers: because they have free sugar.
It comes from "bunkers", which are linked to the lead everywhere in Ogoni: According to experts, Niger's part of the Niger river will lose the country every day at least 16 million litres of powder.
But only a small part of the provisionally stored surfaces will be illegally advertised: the largest part of the organized crime network, to which the political and high position of military representatives, to tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate on whether the population has caused disasters and their commitments or the lax of production, considers Akpobari activist as a clean academic.
"If the fishermen were not viewed as a farmer and if they weren't perfectly destroyed the lives of the fishermen, it wouldn't be even a Sabbath, nor a clay and a illegal raffinery."
Meanwhile, the relationship of Ogoni is especially so devastated to Shell that it seems only to the decline of the concern: "Can other nations be shown as Chinese as better."
Michael is disappointed.
"The highest time to lose," says the wallet manufacturer.
"Every time the soldiers can come."
If a special military unit had found it, they would not be threatened, but a painful tax.
Also soldiers who come from north of the country - like all the Nigerian - want to benefit from the surface.
"Therefore the damn thing got our land in all ways to the bottom," says Akpobari.
The investigators discovered a dangerous building error in the A380 engines
A380 has apparently a great security force.
The investigators tried to look at the machines that came nearly, my nature of a building error that could lead to "the catastrophic accident of the engine".
The aircraft company Qantas wants to blame the engine manufacturer.
At the start of November, Qantas traveling airbus was apparently more happy than it was known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has achieved a great security force on some machines A380 engines in its investigations and now warns against my construction error.
Perhaps the commitment should have difficult results: on one connection, the markets could be found for requiring, this quarter included in the public declaration of the ATSB Authority.
This power could lead to the "catastrophical accident of the engine".
It's an engine made by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft A380.
Among them is the airbus of Qantas, which had to join in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian aircraft company has now undertaken legal steps against the British Turbine manufacturer.
She denied the complaint to the Australian Court of Justice in Sydney, which allows further legal measures against this company.
The leader of the company of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would ask for an accident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fuel, parts were released, and they hurt the nose tables.
Rolls-Royce indicated for the damage of burning.
After this event, it must be changed throughout the world up to 40 engines.
The Australian investigators noted that other safety tests were carried out with the aircraft areas that were equipped by the engines concerned.
The Security Recommendation is an outcome of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said speaker ATSB Martin Dolan.
The safety failure was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all of them about.
After the neighborhood arrived, Qantas left a flying company with its A380 football for a few weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380 cross-border land.
Airhansa changed in one A380 engine as security measures.
The two-party airport is the biggest personal airport in the world.
The total nutrition calls chaos in the transport
Germany's whole white: almost in the whole country was snow in the night.
In many streets, chaos rules, flames and aircrafts are disrupted.
At least three people died in transport accidents.
Winter winter Germany: Nearly the whole Republic fell on Thursday on Thursday at snow temperatures - which leads to many locations to transport chaos.
On the north and east, it lies in some places to 15 metros of snow.
A number of distances and many streets are strongly concerned about personal transport.
At A7 in Flensburg, the road service was still in the snow, but it did not get the new snow.
It was still a strong wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Society for Flight and Hydrography (BSH) is expected at the Baltic Sea border in Slesvik-Holštinland a sudden bulb with the water condition of 1,2 metres above the normal.
The snow convictions caused significant problems in Saska on the streets and state forces.
According to the wrong time centers of Meteodia, therefore, in Switzerland was the highest degree of payment in Saska Switzerland.
Of the part, there were 30 meters of new snow, strong and fresh snow.
Some cost and personal vehicles remained there last night.
In Sasku-Anhalts, the police offices also reported a great degree on the streets.
A2 caused the wind and the snow a late operation and snow.
In Durynsk, there were moves for snow on A4 and A9.
According to German roads, a large movement in Saska, Sasku-Anhalts, Durynska and Northern Bavorska is held.
The problems are snow on the snows, turned trees on the rows or spread up leading and exhaust.
The remote operation from Lipska to Norimberk must have been stopped in Sask.
In the Dorian Saalfeld he had to stop one ICE at Mnich.
165 travelers got in the street from the farmers and salvators of the wheat, food and drinks.
The snow wind runs through the street.
In the large German aircraft, the snows have been abandoned for many years.
According to the speaking centres for information about the years, Mnich's years have been announced.
In Frankfurt to Mohan, according to Fraport's speaker has been canceled for 40 years.
The maintenance of the road is in a non-constant sample.

The rider died.
In the battle, four travelers were hurt - the way from Bayreuth to Norimberk remained closed until the ransom hours.
And to that end, a 30-year-old woman died after she returned to Aschaffenburg with her car.
The meteorological owner, however, is a good news: the snow will remain in the form of easily following, and therefore it will also be informed at easy occurrences.
But the wind is weak.
Only at the Baltic Sea will be the victories of the victory.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally to minus 15 degrees.

Thousands of tricks for dead horners
More than 100,000 people have stuck the memory of insulted horners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after some explosions in the bottom.
It hasn't yet been able to save the dead because the security is still complicated in the shadow.
Nearly two weeks ago, Pike River Mine came near the city of Greymouth to a strong explosion.
29 horses in age from 17 to 62 were thrown down.
In the shadow, where the accident occurred, the sondae was released, she didn't discover any trace after life.
From high concentrations of fuel gas and the following explosions, the salvation force could not be removed because of safety.
After the second strong detectors, the offices and experts have taken out that the horners have no chance to survive.
It hasn't yet been able to save the dead.
Now the memory of the dead family and friends.
In Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand, ten thousand people were conceived in solar weather.
They've lost two minutes.
For the remembrance of the insulted horns, there were 29 tables, on which healing, lighting, and name of horners.
Also pictures and personal things, such as clothes and surfing holes, found their place here.
The State government buildings were putting flags on half the garden.
The New Zealand hoped that the horners would go back from the "depth of the country" to the surface, said to the ecstasy ministerial president of the New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He couldn't disappoint his son until he saw his dead man, he said, "Lawry Drew, whose son Zen was cast down.
In addition to the Ministerial President and family victims, a number of diplomatic diplomatics also occurred.
During the 19th November explosion, British and South African horners were also arrested.
Salvators started making fire inside the corner down on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the gases are released, the high temperature inside begins with the covering, the police president Gary Knowles said to the police journalists.
Get in the sand, warriors!
Is the horror coming to a artistic cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Relf is trying to get the old border again with his war epoch "Walhalla Rising".
What public would the Danish register Nicolas Winding Refn think when he was running "Walhalla Rising"?
The hosted Viking fight with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be released from his murderers and in a big manner killing almost with the overborn force of his opposite - it sounds ideal for young ladies who seek blood action, because our herd helps cruel killing methods, and his enemies will even live inside of the breast when he has a wrong order.
On the other hand, the One, as it is called, does not speak the word during the whole movie, and the final positions shall be made at least one or two centuries or let them go to the strategy of the dead cries.
On the other hand, he's silent and whispered in a widely beautiful land of Scotland, which offers a bird of Viking's world about thousands of years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult film oversight with interest in existency and very quiet camera boxes.
It's good if the film has more target groups, it's just a damage when they disconnect each other.
Regissor Winding Relf, after he has touched his divorce and acquired triology on drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of the Regisseur Quentina Tarantin, but the stacks are preventing his works to enhance or more the humor of the main holiday or less brutal artificial public.
Most artists of the artistic cinema are obviously allowed to be distributed throughout the brain and the interior.
Action movies are delayed at the moment when the One is released from freely explainable deeds with a group of violent Christian missionaries to Jerusalem and remains a dream of the whole activity in uncertainty and milk before it seems to be filled with a man to America and still there.
So there is no wonder that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" hasn't reached a cinema and has now been issued only on DVDs.
It is primarily damage because of wonderful boxes, but also because it is personally fasad, places to collection of blood, hides the exciting cine, which has been a little attention.
This movie doesn't matter dialogue or exact, all is the atmosphere, the hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for a fucking fuck.
The refund doesn't stop him even a moment of freedom and quietly give him the soul of his deceitful pigs and cloud hypnotical sound track, especially the unwritable hatred that causes him from the heart position.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the Unicode, leaves something like innocentness, all the remaining ones are deceived by evil.
Of all the most unique herds, whose motives will never be explained, which will become a time for enemies and transitional association with the warfare of the peculiar, perhaps by the devil.
It makes a consequence, but maybe only for those deceived.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that is possible to hate and wonder, for disappointment, excitation and wonder.
Contribution.
Incredible land work
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has a new warning on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the earth prevents exhibition and doesn't allow controls.
At the midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warfare airports F-15 I will be attacked by a mistake quarter building in Syria.
They stand on the edge of Euphrat; the nearest city is 30 miles away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Authority (IAEA) its name is shown when a reacter, which has dataly set Syria with Northern Korea in this quarter hidden in the valley that rejects the run.
On the basis of the US-American Secret Service of Secret Services from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village of El-Kibar, was well able to produce a plutonian - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technology of the fifteen years doesn't happen to anything else.
She presented videos with unexpected satellite photos.
The computer animation explained where the components of the reactor could be before the destruction should be a reduced copy of the northern Korean nuclear model of Yongbyon.
Moreover, photos were presented that showed the building nearby or even outside.
The reacter was too short before the start, but yet without fuel articles.
Today, after more than three years after bombing, it doesn't know much more than that time, even the hazards have grown in time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently announced in his memories that she was very sure before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reaction, but in fact she had no foundations that there was a "active nuclear weapons program in the country".
Some reporter secret services in Europe are still more careful and only speak about "appealable reaction", even though presentations → are considered "cheaper".
They miss evidence, as IAEA.
When the question is sure that he has a reacter before him, he answered a high diplomat of the United Nations in the year, IAEA has "success of material to ask questions".
The system of "unused military buildings" was evidently dismissed, even though the Syrians were rejected and also correctly equipped with the teren.
However, in June 2008, the IAEA team was able to be held under the execution of an ex-Cheap Inspector O · Heinonen in el-Kibar the urane rate made by people.
Furthermore, it received IAEA through a satellite photograph of commercial sellers from the timely after an attack that should be greater than those presented by the Member State.
Unfortunately, these clusters are not on the market because they have exclusively bought an unknown client - perhaps Israel.
IAEA cannot therefore confirm their justice.
Syria said she had never had a secret nuclear program or even made a reacter.
Uran comes from Israel's weapons, and Damasek's eating.
But it returned IAEA after the partition analysis.
Since that time, Damashek refuses to discuss things - just as about satellite boxes.
In addition, he prohibited the auditors of the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the concerns of the disbombed buildings.
But Israel will certainly be silent.
"We will never comment this," he recently confirmed the official statute at the time of the Governing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case is thus declined from June 2008 and "a serious problem in view of the confidentiality of the Authority", as a high west diplomatic in the IAEA seat in Vienna has admitted - it is, however, a serious violation of nuclear weapons prohibited by IAEA.
IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter three other devices that have to be "in the connection" with the data reaction -- and they still exist.
However, the auditors have not been sent down, nor have they been subjected to any equipment, or why they are understood.
According to the news of Southdeutsche Zeitung, IAEA is internally marked as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, which is transported again by nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isus) identified these objects and found on satellite complex buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is obviously located within or without the closest of the military foundation - exactly from this point IAEA rejects the access of Syria to these three places.
In Vienna, Syriane was afraid of fishing expedition - that IAEA would have been sent before the United States to provide military bases.
Nuclear detectives were warned of the US secret service equipment.
IAEA has funds and satellite photos that the material was transported here and there between these three places and the quarter of Euphrat.
In Viden, a high west diplomatic said at least one of them should be "in relation to the production of fuel".
But there are no "no evidence of sensible activity", so of the cultivation of uran and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reacter is deceived by an urin which is not disappointed.
But from where the uran comes and where it should be able to buy the pluton on the bomb, these central issues are only likely to be deceived.
It is also not known whether the concerns that could hide important tracks are hidden in these three places.
Jacobs have disappeared from the surface of a hundred costs of costs of cars, no one seems to have information where this system has been.
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar remote and on the other side of Euphrat lying al-Tibni, which allowed Syria to check in 1998 as an appropriate radioactive waste fund, IAEA considers unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley gave him a connection with an reactor in an analysis of satellite photos for the renamed journal Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, photos from the universe show that after IAEA requested access, Syria carried out in all suspicious areas of landwork and removed large containers.
It could be about the event, but it couldn't explain the suspect.
Moreover, the diplomatic circles refer to the IAEA to the creation of a plan for reviews that would allow Syria to maintain the eventual military secrets - only this weighing shows how much the interest of revisors is.
The lady also refused us.
If western diplomates in Vienna still have been silent for a year ago that the reaction is destroyed, and therefore this thing does not burn, the US Glyn Davies is already talking about special inspections, which is one of the strongest insights, which has a visional nuclear office for control.
The leader of IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to inspecte, even though he has already spoken of the "options to which I'm going to be in the future" while he's weakened.
This option clears a large risk: On one hand, the need for IAEA's IAEA Council and many of the 35 insured countries has no decisive interest in scaling.
On the other hand, how one diplomat warns, "What will happen if they finally don't find anything?"
Love in War
Since the time Angelina Jolie began working on still unnamed rulers in the summer, the motion has occurred.
Sama wrote a scenario, a favorable story of a woman from Bosna and a husband in Serbia.
He doesn't know much more about it yet, but it also causes no calm.
They endured talking about that the woman, who is a muslim, loves her during the war in Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who violated her.
Bosen's women's families protested immediately, so the planned arrival from Sarajevo to Hungary was moved to Â°O.
The film was touched in Hungary, and it was in post-production, but in Bosnia still protested.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women's War victims wrote through UN-Organization to help UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with herds, now informed the Bosnian newspapers - Jolie is also a highlighting UN-Organization for the help of the rebels.
It's not just diplomatic - she offered women a week ago a meeting in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must be in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps where he was violent, gracious stories were not conceived, and Jolie’s position in front of the victim is expressed enough about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended the UN organization to assist the emergencies to leave Jolie as a highlighting, informs Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie just write?
The Bosen Ministry of Culture, which had been reading her scenario, allowed after small tachynies in Sara's campaign - not completely, but Jolie did not even accept it.
A young author notes that in his film, no political intentions have been made in Jugoslavia with great effort that he wants to show the terrible effects of war and to all the parties involved in giving room.
As regards the scope, it remains unexpected.
On the Internet, another version of the movie that sounds really different: Lovers already knew before the beginning of the war and again met when it is as a bossian muslim attached to the Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
What really sounds pretty different than "the victim of violence is loved in his torture."
The fact that the film Jolie is actually starting before war is true.
Jolie suggests that the pressure is developed on it, "not fair and based on wrong information."
Now it can be freed from Hollywood's heckers: The publication of her scenario illegally on the Internet, how they have done it many times.
Nothing Before Disabled
This evening is good for Iry again.
Not a trace after the arrest.
The home team dominates too highly over his hosts from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Faunishers of joy for the sound of music sounds, deep feet.
Bailey-Pub in the Southern Cork, because players have tennis bottles at a distance of three meters to beer chemicals - and they are lucky.
"Pi·pong" is called a bizarre division and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winner premium and to fly to Las Vegas for the world's mistership in a pond of Ireland.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this crying beer game and sustainable information, it doesn't work much together.
Yet, a 26-year-old man is trying to enjoy, repeat from a serious question, which will bring the future.
His plan is not playing yours in Las Vegas, he goes to a conversation in January to New Zealand.
"I have such a wonderful feeling," he says.
"It's so far and I don't have a job there yet."
However, his girlfriend is already waiting for in Auckland - "without a time she got her great work as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
For the wrong viewers of the house, they tried to find their happiness in the two of the three Tanner's conferences.
His sister Yvonne, a social officer, is in Sydney, his brother Colin is now located as a IT adviser in London.
Boys go away: Like Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
1000,000 Ireland will leave at the time of the country concerned, predicted by the experts of the Economy Institute and Social Affairs of the ESRI in Dublin.
They even count up to 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small land with only 4,5 million inhabitants, this is a fundamental loss.
If the proposal is confirmed, it will come to the similar exhibition of the wheel that Ireland suffered in the eighty years.
After the decades of the rebellion brought to Ireland a great blessing, the inconsciousness is now again expanded.
The economic crisis is increasing, especially, young, educated Iry, who have lived only awaiting.
The loss of employment and social meeting seemed to be absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was to stay.
Meanwhile, there are three of the ten women and men to 30 years without work.
In Irish Times, there are many readers who strive to say, "Ireland is all going out of the cup."
"There should be to rise against politicians and bankers -- who can, but he goes away, and our country loses all generations."
"Let the poster get out of it, please."
The Leanne Caulfield rights student, the President of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black, because the government is only a claim, and the young people don't offer any views to the future.
"They reduce the minimum mood, but they have no strategy to create a new job of places," says the 20th.
She observes how her partners are moved from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move up in four years.
"This idea is mild and depressive."
Man like Stephen McLarnon is trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a total service for the theme of work in the work.
"For starters on the work market, it's a work in the startup but a wonderful chance, how to make the first steps on the carrying box," says the manager.
On his web sites, photos of surfers in Australia and snowboards are in Canada.
The report is: Working in the board is not gallees, but freedom and joy.
What it's to build somewhere else, he knows about half the year Sean O'Donovan.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues in the building in Germany.
He's just putting a modern house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan will get a rare home, because he works in additional changes to be able to pay money home at home.
"The situation is sometimes a little stupid," he says, "when the first time he's overcoming the road of his own house.
"I'm doing money in Germany at the house of Ireland in which I'm not actually."
He's laughing out and wearing cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good quarter with gardens holding, parking a great dear cars in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by money.
"It was a foolish time, simple money was without a lot of questions," he says.
He's afraid that it wouldn't be able to do good with the bathroom?
O'Donovan thinks about a moment, a bitter tea down, and says, "I have a kid I should live and I'm young; even if everything turns away, I can start again."
The building engineer doesn't have any calls that he hears so often.
"Nobody needs to be hungry - our responsibility is not even so dramatic as before on this island," he says.
"It's not the worst time to work in the bathroom -- maybe we'll just feel like Ireland."
He's laughing and then talking about his father who's left for the last economic crisis to England.
After seven years, he was again from the rain and life went on in Ireland, very simple.
Cian Tanner has this idea.
Let the future be opened and just wait for life to be developed elsewhere.
He has also been working for a few years in London, and why should it not be good at New Zealand for— and his friendship?
But there is another thing that takes him quite anxious in these days: celebration of his 27th birth on Friday in Dublin.
They're afraid she could turn to the divorce celebration.
"The mainly no emotion," he says and drinks a little bird.
"Good, that sounds anxious."
"Let's calling it to celebrate the department, completely simple, with some friends, a few drinks, a few hers."
Current practice of democracy
The support of democracy in Latin America grows, as the support of private business.
The material activity is more concerned than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influenced than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latino Barometer review, which was held in 18 countries and was exclusively out of the period The Economyst.
Since the investigation has been regularly carried out since 1995, it can take into account changes in the positions of the whole area.
In the aeroplane, which was conducted in September and at the beginning of October, two related things are dominated.
Of them is that Latin America has an extremely happy success.
The second is to increase the stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in some countries in the area of South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been average of 6% per year since 2002, democracy has increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy was rejected after deep reduction in production in the latest year.
But only about half of the questioned in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most important areas, are democratic convictions, which downloads the regional dimension (see graph 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents expressed satisfaction in the way democracy works in their country in practice, the same number as in the latest year, but in comparison with the year 2001, when 25% of their country, it is a big growth (graph 3).
The total of 34% indicated that they trusted the snow in their country and 45% trusted the government, again the same numbers as last year, but it is a large share compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis was underground to the Democracy in Latin America.
The support resulted in the world’s financial crisis, probably from the fact that many Latin American countries have suffered only a short recession and have enjoyed a strong survival.
Moreover, the stronger social security network helped poor people to protect.
(The Commission of the United Nations for Latin America has announced this week that the situation of Latin Americans in poverty has increased only in 2009, and has risen to 32% in this year.)
But it changes in a wide spectrum from the country to the country (see section 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its declining president Luize Inácia Luly da Silvy will be reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This is rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recess was more serious and harmed the status of violent crimes.
Since the time they began to investigate, more respondents in the Latin America have seen as the most important problem of crime than unemployment (see graph 5).
A total of 31 per cent says that they or their neighbors have become themselves or their neighbors in the latest year of crime sacrifice, but that is a reduction in comparison with data 38 per cent of the last year and is also a lowest number since 1995.
More economic efficiency is reflected in the growing support for private enterprises and market businesses: approximately 71% of the respondents throughout the world say that private enterprises are necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% of 2007 (see graph 6).
Approximately 58% agree that market economy is the only system that allows developing their country, this percentage increased from 47% of the past year.
It is interesting that 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have the same view (and 80% there supports private business), although their left president Hugo Chavez has many private fires.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the 19% of the respondents (approximately 18% in the latest year), followed by the United States (9%, latest year without change) and Venezuela (9%, above 11% in the latest year)
However, the United States are considered the most influential countries in Mexico and in most parts of Central America, whereas Venezuela is more successful in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nikaragu.
Critical options
No one expected that general options for Haiti were perfect on 28 November.
But they were much worse than outsides who were trying to help the land reached to fear.
Elections mean the fill of urns and repeated voting, the voting lines spread by channels, the divorced electoral rooms and the fear.
Election rooms opened after hours of late.
Many Haitikans, including many moved from the yellow landscape, moved around and tried to see where they could go to call.
Some of them finally did it.
More than ten presidential candidates, including some of the proposed preliminary candidates, claimed that it was the subject and called after the vote was canceled.
Protests, some of them of violence, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a highly established Officer of the United Nations at Haiti, declared, "in many ways, it was a very good choice."
The observers of the United States and the Caribbean community said cautiously that "not believe that, whatever they were serious, the process had not needed to be rejected."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are committed to René Preval, shall notify the non-annual representative of the President and his candidate to Jude Célestin, preliminary outcome on 7.
The expected decision-making commitment is planned for ice.
All elections are not lost.
Two previous opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, raper and Mirlande Manigat, former lady, went away from their earlier challenges so that the vote was announced as invalid.
The problem, however, may occur if Mr Célestin, who has a small or insufficient support between electors, will be marked by the electoral committee because he has reached the decision-making court.
Because of the series of cholery epidemies and more than 1 million people who still live in the landscape, feared that the election would be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to choose, but they were forbidden from the deorganisation.
A total of 250 thousand indicators of identity that are necessary for voting have remained shortly unseparated before elections.
It's a lot in the square.
The donors see the election of legitimate and annual governments as a fundamental step in the Haiti reconstruction.
And then it's fair that the Haitian's rules are on itself.
In the center of the puzzle
In the weeks when she was soon awake, Cristina Fernández, the argentin president, from the sympathy of the public, when her popularity strengthened from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since it was selected in 2007.
However, the turn of this success in a successful campaign for the second oval period in elections in the next year can depend on whether Ms. Fernández is incompatible with his master, preacher and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
And all of these knowledge will be done.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy and after his wife became a successful president, was increasing in the creation of budgets under the tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the first couple to lose further income for freedom.
Mrs. Fernández's government was lost in the latest year in Congress.
But the opposition was divided and continued destabilised at Mr. Kirchner's death for an infarct on 27 October.
Some members of the governing political movement of Peronist have joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings, Congress could not approve the budget for 2011.
"I don't agree," said the President.
Starting for 2010 will also be paid for the next year, while the President will have more space to lose for freedom.
Economy is excessive: the growth is likely to grow up to 9% for years.
The official inflation rates now reach 11,1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about numbers that are about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took up the office in 2003, when Argentine was sought for economic collapses, set a priority for growth and decreasing poverty, more than for inflation control.
He refused to act with MMF, washing the private sector and cleaning the INDEC, the statistical agency, which had been accompanied to monitor the official inflation.
Can President Fernández now kill this policy?
She invited to negotiate between private enterprises and committees.
And her officers say that they want to limit the growth of breasts to 18% in the next year.
Economy was supported by the growth of world prices for the export of argentinian agricultural products.
But the inflation rejected the growth based on big devalvacy in 2002.
This may be the reason why Mrs. Fernández knows that he wants to restore the argentin financial liabilities to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government established an agreement with the holder of debt which had previously rejected the restructuring of the debt which Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, Mrs. Fernández's agreement with the credible governments who are bought in the Paris Club, which debts about $6,7 billion.
Kirchners -- was to keep this ability not to oversee MMF as usually.
But last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs, announced that the fund will provide a "technical assistant" to offer a new national consumer-value index, which will lead to the introduction of cleaning INDEC.
There is no longer a chance if Mrs. Fernández will want to stay in politics after the end of the period when the husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, it will be supported by the central class that is involved by the chirchnism.
At the time of the return of the Argentinas from the aerodrome allowed in March, the wheel will fall into the sympathy.
He will want to win further choices, he will have to decide whether there is a need for a number of views that her wife had in politics.
Poland promotion for China
Thailand's electors are closer to the closer connection with peʹna.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother through the sea?
More than 7,5 billion walkers, 70% of the authorised, chose on November 27, and the town's advice in five cities, which could be considered as a larger assessment of President Ma Ying.
Mr. President Hat alone is a representative of the feelings that have a strong foundation in business issues, including partly free trade agreement, in the largest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed a test, but just closely.
Although its side of Kuomintang (KMT) ended with three of the five senior offices, she could not win a vote.
According to the Democratic Progression of the Partie, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is the most independent of Taiwan, reached almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it was about the presidential election, the President Ma should be moved.
Since two years ago, the share of the votes of his side was reduced by approximately 8%.
First of all, the DPP was together with the KMT in the town Councils.
The options were played as a part of the Taiwan elections that include sound election cars and mass conjunctions with wheels with clothing girls.
In part, it was even a secret attempt to attain.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chana, the honest President of KMT, was to fight for KMT candidates in the previous election evening.
The young man shot Mr. Lien cleanly through his face, hurt her and killed her bowl.
Bizarly was not determined whether the weapons were intended to hurt Mr. Lien or to cope with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, leader DPP, claims that the shooting has affected elections, suspect falls on DPP and leads the electoral to KMT.
I hope the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was watchful how she stayed in the background of the question of a single peʹna.
Instead, the candidates have deployed plans for the national housing and the creation of workplaces.
Taiwan usually uses his de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
Hence, the KMT has the trend to avoid the commitments to the Government in Peking.
But this time DPP also left from the excitation of anti-Chinese positions.
It is a reaction to the capacity and to realize that the Chinese trade has a key importance for the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, on his side, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable for Taiwan.
From the Government in Peking, it can be expected to continue in commercial payments, together with its strategy to take Taiwan back to the sheep.
China did not work time when sending a negotiator to Taipeah to order summits on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also see political integration, but continue.
This will be better expected after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP party has in any case discovered itself.
Two years ago, it was a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to proceed on the basis of a corruption accusation.
The president in 2000-08 was a puzzle and a guardian of independence.
But under the direction of Mrs. Tsai has developed a new generation that is deadly and the DPP works firmly to join experts and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate to the President, such as Su Tseng-changem, who was established under Mr. Chen.
Their sides are now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Peking.
Ms. Tsai has published the research institutions' plans that serve as a contact site between DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can be carried out without the previous submination.
Mrs. Tsai notifies the Taiwan public that her side represents "trusted alternative" to the invasive access to Mr. Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be dismissed by this move.
In the statement issued from his cell, he expressed the opinion that the DPP candidates would have been better if they had been on Taiwan's own country.
He even commanded Mr. Su, a pleasure to ignore the president.
But without the demand of Mr. Chena, DPP will fight for the choice between potential candidates.
KMT is authorised to search for own people.
The evaluation of Mr. Ma was bad, even in the excessive time of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign.
His impatience seems to be based, especially on unemployedness and injury between the rich and the poor.
The KMT speaker says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local bathrooms.
The strongly prosecuted taxes for Taiwan's support for association with friendships are decreased.
At the same time, the competition of the Taiwan citizens considers economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonia Chianga, the prominent publicist, "the boat from which no return has already been returned."
Grammy price nomination: Esperanza Spalding song is a surprise in the best new artist category
The exemption to the President and people must be taken into consideration legally.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year jazz basket and a song that President Obama has chosen to enter the Nobelov's price for peace in 2009, is marked as one of the surprises of Grammy prices in this year with the best new artist category.
Since Spalding was celebrated a position on the jazz scene since 2008, when its album "Esperanza", the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with the rules of Grammy when the artist cannot issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is set."
Her ambitional album of 2010 "Chamber Music Society" certainly mentioned a step in front and thanks to its unseeming vocal and hot hand with elements of pop, function and latin influence, we can talk about Spaldings as about success, which in 2003 Norah Jones, the nearest equivalent for voting in Grammy, seeking similar language work in this category for last years.
Other Grammy's portors rightly appreciate the Vijay Iyer Trio "Historics" album in the instrumental album category, exciting, refreshing album box, which was a heavy favorite in the lanch year.
Iyer will competite against the album of the experimented saxofonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and John Beasley's "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a chariot favorite from New Orleans and a famous host in the HBO "Treme" order was evaluated in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of the Steampunk received a few serving recognition in the category of big files when the chemical mez Childs En and still a courageous Dave Holland, whose live album with the oct "Pathways" has created a beautiful example of how the baset could have a free hand as a captain.

Planned mixture in Temecule receives the approval of the Planning Committee
The planned mixture in Temecule has obtained a single support for the local planning committee after more than five hours often of a disturbable public witness.
Critici attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the stop of trade.
However, the prosecutors decided about the middle night that the new religious centre is in accordance with the local laws and will be effective.
"Most good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday.
"I'm very proud about this as a American citizen."
"It means that justice wins."
"Opposition is minimal" added.
"They who are opposers only speak votes."
"We have good people in our valley."
It started in six hours a night and was at the midnight when the time was taken a discussion with people who were for or against the center. These votes were equally divided, the Press-Enterprise attacks.
Discussion continued on the web pages of news.
"There is no more America," said one comment.
"We're the Planet of Opics with Socho's freedom falling into the fish."
"America has fallen."
The Planned Islamic Centre also called protests in other parts of the country, including the nearby Ground Zero, the tragedy place that was held on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley, Mahmoud Harmoush was a violent trial.
His religious property reading approximately 135 families in Riverside County for a year without an accident, but he wanted more and more room than a store room that was found together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
The new mixture of 24 943 quarter stages in the Mediterranean will also have two minerals and grow up to 43 degrees.
She should take a place with a dilution of 4,32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three miles eastly from Chaparral High School.
The opposers can still call to the city's advice on the project.
Microblocks with disorder towards the arse increase the possibility of new types of life on earth or otherwise
Experience of wonderful bacteria that can use brass as one of its foods, extends the Area to search for new life forms on Earth and may be further.
The scientists have discovered an unexpected bacteria here on Earth and say that it is a sign that life has the possibilities that remain outside the main elements that have been considered and based.
"This body has two powers."
"They can grow either by the fosfor or the arsen."
"This is very special, but it's not a evidence that it's a quality of the form of "external" life," the fact of Paul C. W. Davies from Ar日na State, together with a report that appeared on Thursday on the Science Journal.
Long was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrocarbon, dust, acid, fosfor and sire.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake in California are able to continue growing after heat is replaced by fosfor.
"Begins to be surprised what everything is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arivan State, together with messages.
This finding is important to search for life outside the earth, because researchers must be able to solve life and view how life can look, said Anbar.
It's focused on microbs found on Earth.
However, the report of this report was published to discuss it, which did not discuss the details of the finding, calls for a wide speculation on the Internet that the report was discovered by the outermost life.
It's not like that.
Revelation "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that cover biochemics and that now the elements we consider as "standard" must not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor on Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open, in Milton Keynes, British.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the substitution of one element by the other elements in the basic biochemic and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a suitable finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who was studying, focused on Mono Lake because she shows a high cold of arsen.
Arzen and fosfor are chemically similar elements, so she thought that the microb, which is built by both elements, could be replaced by one another.
"Arzen is primarily eating because his chemical behavior is a very similar fosfor."
"The result is that organisms can be very difficult to separate these elements from themselves."
"Always arzen is so different that it doesn't work as the fosfor. When it gets into the body, he's going to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists shape bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and produce a growing concentration of arsen, which are able to adapt and grow.
Microbs grow better in the effect of fosfor, but because they can also survive with the replacement of arsen, it increases the possibility that the form of life that uses arsen can be discovered naturally, or otherwise on the earth or on another planet or month, where the harvest is more slow.
Jamie S. Foster, a professional microbiology assistant for Florida, announced that the thought of arzen, which could be replaced by fosfor, was not a new, but never found an example on which this facility would be shown.
Arzen was more running in the early times of the earth, said, and thus the speculates were able to use it in the former form of life.
"This indicates that there could be other ways to create life, not only by the way he was created in the wound of the earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute
Remaining dogs robbed were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found. He informed the sheriff of Los Angeles on Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs - two actors and wild pembroke corgis - disappeared in the shot when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, where they traveled night at Bellflower 6 Motel.
Two dogs were discovered in the middle of the afternoon and there were two dogs then in the middle of the evening, said Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the police division for LA.
"The good news is that dogs are all right," said Whitmore.
"They're in a good state."
"They were delivered to their owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where dogs were found, in which place, did not share the details about their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We keep rules."
Hunders, Christina Rickard and David Peek, were not encouraged to get out of the case.
They had great joy when their two actions were found in the Downey attack in the middle of the afternoon.
Sheriff's representatives found out and two dogs separately in Compton.
Action Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month feet Didi, were without hurt, reported offices.
But Bunny and Peter, the tribe of Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were to plan this week of competition by the name of their Japanese owners, were not found until they had been found later in the middle.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are this weekend in the town to attend AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they were to show Trace.
The other dogs had to concurre in other competitions planned in days before the AKC/Eukanuba exhibition, said Peek the Times journal in the middle.
South California is only one hour for a monthly journey after dogs of exhibition.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard were registered in a motel.
Often they are in the motels and parking their car before the room window.
They also took three dogs - boxer boxer boxers, Parson's terrier and the British box - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Actions and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where they should be cold.
They shot the windows so that they could have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard announced the car rail in 6 hours in the trail.
Peek said he would offer a recompense to anyone who's leading to lost dogs, and the dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, the prices would be granted.
Lev is ready to go back now when restructuring MGM is obtained from the court of final approval
After 18 months of disturbance and disturbance, MGM finally got green to be able to start again.
New York's Federal Innovation Court of Justice, on Thursday, officially blessed the "before the packaging" schedule of the believers to equipe about $5 billion and clean the way for 86 years age of company, which is focused on the production and production of films and television shows.
A quarter result that the plan is compliing with the requirements of the United States competitive rule does not remain any legal claim to restart the founder Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who become the main leaders of the study.
The beginning of employees will decrease 320 of the pizzas more than 400.
The MGM shall not decline immediately from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase is not agreed on planned financial resources that allow 500 million dollars to finance new operations and MGM production.
It is now a connection with the investment bank, which is expected by 75 million dollars and is expected by half of the financing.
The restructuring process started in May 2009, when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was acquired to consult the management of its funds, since the management was fighting to allow payments of rate for $300 million per year.
This August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-General Director of Enron and a professional for the operation of Crispy Creme Doughnuts.
The study was longer than expected to solve the MGM financial movement and 140 believers.
After a few months, the parties have agreed that they would be sold to the end of 2009.
Though a few interesters were attached, no one was willing to pay $2 billion plus the financial requested by the creditors.
In the years of the year, everything was back on the designer, and the MGM team began to work on the plan of restructuring. After months of discussion and internal accidents, the plan was finally approved by the believer at the end of October.
When MGM in the next weeks will be officially released from the market, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion bonuses in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1,2 million, will be paid to $9.5 million.
Cooper firms who incase for their services that run through the company, 375 000 dollars a monthly, will receive a payment for success, such as "s·cess fee" 4 million dollars.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to restore production in MGM, which has issued only one movie in this year and to give records to seven or eight films that will come out at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, which will be proposed by the Hobit book, together with Warner Bros.
It's a special payment between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share in these two films that Peter Jackson will register.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owned about 18% of MGM debt, looked for the possibility of associating study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he was the largest shareholder.
Nevertheless, recent negotiations between both companies have not been established in the Agreement.
Technological games that will maintain your budget for gifts in equality
The leader of the year's aeroplane candidate is the most appropriate iPad player who follows the videohere system. In both cases, it is a significant principle in the budget for gifts.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five corners BMX for 99 dollars and one Kinect game is the same as 10 coral swimming or approximately 48 pieces Play-Doh.
But there's a way to maintain your budget for gifts in the balance.
Recently I visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic games I could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately that Moore's law worked; the aircraft games have much more energy, and it is at the same prices, not less than anything, compared to the past years.
While relatively less new games with associated web games, two most famous games of this type, Webkinz and Penguin Club offer more.
Increases the number of games with button battery, as the game with battery buyers.
Here's some recommendations.
(All those prices are from Toys "R" Us, other than cases that are distinguished.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, 3 years old) are a bleeding animal that lies when you press them.
On one pressure, it issues the animal tone and the second press begins to create a song.
You're buying more than one, they're going to sing together and harmonic.
Warning: When you start cat, you can't stop.
The best option in the combination of song and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, since 2 years)
Last year, I bought on Elmo Live technology a 14-house animated girl who can play the game Simon Says and also know the monthly course thanks to his innovation-score legs with blocking rounds.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor game, although their parents are struggling to lack of sound control.
You're a 80-year-old baby, you may remember Alâe, one of the first computer educational games.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for children of 3 years), with a bathroom of full cheese cards that are proposed so that the driving changes in fun with the work with a self-real, fun workshop.
You're always sending a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the most important variance with simple use, with qwerts, although games do not have such effects— learning as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with the elderly units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce her and e-books and has a place on SD card that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children of 8 years) is a five-cotch file that is not more than a box of fire, each of them has a LED display.
The goal is to create words by placeing the bone in a row before it expires the time; it is great for consensus in improvised form of words.
More games has at least a type of online connection.
At the highest level, two Webkinz and Penguin games were placed in the games.
If you want to buy your child a online game from Penguin Club, for example, you can choose Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains mines with a covered code.
When you activate online code, your child will receive enough credits in the business of the Penguin Club stores for two liberal items.
It could include a cocktail brush or a Puffle animal.
About something smaller than you're happy with your teeth card is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children of 5 years), the latest of a number of micro robots on the button battery.
Brook is moved on 12 vibrators of silicon foot in the appropriate direction.
It's fun when you're doing a bullet of the bone and seeing if he can find a way out.
He's also very relaxed.
The one we were able to fall from the kitchen table and to keep even the same time in our dog's ground.
The introduction of the highest police controls in China
As a citizen military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked in the place, closely checked his orders and issued orders with the military authority.
He wanted female members - Chinese state winners of the town order, feared and repeated for their strong steps and injury in the nail - from a certain point of view to the depth of the winds.
"Stop right!"
"Speak!"
Show them, bearing silence, "How beautiful girls look!"
Four very young girls in white hands and the same olive cabs and bullets were watched.
Four pairs of black bottles are sorted as a line.
Four coverages of the head are perfectly sitting on the hairs that are perfectly connected with blue and white stones.
"I particularly think they look prominently," Mr. Tang said excessively.
"The models are nice."
More than one government tried to survive the image of citizen surveys in China.
One city ordered new students to have high school education.
Guangdong's province changed the green green uniforms in a particularly attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China replaced strong weapons views: in 2009, a report was stated that 50 of the carriers were inappropriately surrounded by the carrier and looked closely on the owner until the soldier was packed and departed after half hour.
Xindu, a city period of 680 000 people in Chengdo have chosen the operation for the main image.
Since 2003, he completed his city police with 13 women, which were selected specifically in accordance with their views, proportions and young ones.
The goal is to show outside the deep side of the police, also a worst, female side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson's alone would have to get to the secret Chinese cities groups.
They'd argument the critics of a good deal.
In the case of the police, these police have only been allowed to prosecute the town's claim, keep the demands and other administration of the posts.
But the Chinese communications kyckes are currently assuming the different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei struck an unemployed wheel to die after he used his phone to join, as they began in the progress of protest against the rock.
In the Netherlands year, police schools in Peking were stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual, there was no description of how to draw a pachator without a sign of blood.
This year, a local businessman with a meloon in Shanghai got into the roof with five police officers and suffered the damage of the left part of the brain.
One video game is full of violence that can be downloaded on the Internet, shows Chinese police as attacking the street seller.
"Chengguan feared the government," China Daily, the national issue, claimed in the latest year after the next debate on taktics.
The paper remained "true purification".
Skeptics say that such access will be lost.
Following the period in October, the leader of the Beijing Evening News was asked whether women had an obligation or are only a divorce.
The answer seems to be from both sides.
The time requested a female inquiry from 18 to 22 years with a good position and "five drawings of faces in the right proportion."
Adeptics should have a height higher than the average - so heighter than 1,6 metres.
The service at 26 is obligation.
Functionaries claim that the work is too psychical for women more than 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one of the most mentioned police officers on Rednet.com, like government websites.
"Candidates must first show external quality, which then defines other, belongs to the height, weight, faces, etc."
Then it comes to a series of weight and "internal quality".
Women are like flowers, he said and added, "Besides that they are weighing, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, representative of the chairman of the town, does not agree with this description.
But he stressed that higher requests are also running in China for other jobs and positions, both of them.
Like a demand for relative face drawings.
What means that the question of good consideration is between China's subject of discussion.
Medicinal suspension or disorders are certainly not valid.
"I can't allow you to serve a chrome or crazy man with us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who holds a watch at Baoguang place near the clothes, is 22 years old, faces as a jabble and a deeply creative mouth.
She doesn't think she could have sexists on her view, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with ironic view.
Her 21-year Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the city's image."
They have no matches against their concernful performance, because their career ambitions are more sensitive than only to start businessers in the street where they can perform their activities.
Each group stands against more than ten marketers who run the sands or on the wheels and are trying to sell as much as the biggers and the tofu mixture before they are exhausted.
"Mr. Wangu, you have to leave."
"We've already told you many times!" said Mrs. Xu when the marketer started to flee, and for a time he left his round with a driver with noise.
Policists describe their obligation as more monotonal than injury.
"Each day it's just the same about," said Huang Jing, 20, who's studying in his free marketing.
"The great rutine."
One of the facts is that women's cops have no power as their husband's prosecutors to enjoy the goods of the sales.
They can only be threatened to report their husband's leader.
The tendence will then be protected from the evidence of public enemies against the official apparatus which are running throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the main town of Yunnan, were raised after false reports were spread about the killing of the sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were hurt in nighttimes; 14 government vehicles were converted or overcome.
Xind's still disappeared with such a violent one.
But the calm can only be safe.
Only two blocks from Baoguang, where the police officers had a guard, were stored over 50 people on the street corner.
Policies enjoyed a motorcycle on the road instead of inside the sales, as they require the rules.
The owner of the car could cry as he wanted.
15 minutes away from the police officer, creating up, with a lock against the vehicles and Âe away with the motocycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the man's group, stayed behind, his white mark turned to his name.
Like women's cops, the coordinators are men over 40 years who have only a help role.
They are not educated in the maintenance and detection of images.
"We ever fight verbally."
"We ever fight physically," Mr. Li said things.
"The majority of this is the public who's doing it."
Prosecutors will accuse Ensign's Senator
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice purchased Senator John Ensign from the criminal accusation related to his business with the former adviser for the campaign and his efforts to ensure the lobby in the middle of the Senator.
In the decision, the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican, had concluded, and which, until the scandal period, was considered as a possible Republican candidate to the President for 2012. His affair came to national titles and hurt his career.
Mr. Ensigna said that he was a decision that was followed almost after an annual investigation, "very happy".
The Senator could still be disciplinary at the ethical committee of the Senate.
Mr. Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice "informed us that Senator Ensign was already in the aim of investigation and that it was not in plan to make another accusation against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to reject.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers, other than the Ministry of Justice, which claimed that there were serious evidence that Mr Ensign had prepared a violation of the prohibition of federal lobby.
Chats, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to ensure the lucracy and lobbys that had to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthie, about the Senator's situation with her.
Mrs. Hampton's ever worked as a poster in the Ensign campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and support their opinions after Mr. Hampton worked to work for them, so much he uses documents and discussions.
Since Hampton was an old assistant to Mr. Ensign, he was released from the law of his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that Mr. Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were before friends, have occurred in contrast with the prohibition of lobby.
From the evidence that were published "is evidence that it is the case of preparation of law destruction," Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer, specialised on the acquiring of customers who are investigated by the government.
While the Officers of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers with the ethic specialisation said that the Ministry is careful about political complaints, after a large number of accidents, including the decision of the last year to stop the complaint against the former Senator Ted Stevens with the accusation of the doubt of the State Representative.
The Federal complaints "relevantly hide the weapons," said Melanie Sloan, the Executive Director of the Civil Organization for Responsability and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Respons and Ethics in Washington), a lawyer group who has given in this matter a few guesses against Mr. Ensign.
"It in principle shows that the government officers are not subject to the laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, Master Lawyer of Mr Ensign, in the discussion, reported that he called on Monday the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice and then the second day, and said to him that the Ministership did not seek any accusation against his client.
Mr. Ensign's complainant team cooperates with the complaint in trying to convince that the Senator, as his office repeated in the median declaration, "he acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to determine the legal arguments he gave to the State representatives.
"I am not pleased to consider the details of my debate with the Ministry of Justice other than that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop investigation of self-sufficiency, in which the ethical group claims that the payment of Ensign Hampton parents has violated the federal election law.
The electoral Commission noted that she had no sufficient evidence to demonstrate that money did not mean anything other than a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find a lobby work was NV Energy, the main inhabited company who supported the Senator.
One e-mail from 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began to act as a lobbyist, leader of Mr. Ensigna - John Lopez - he communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that "busil" in the Ministry is inside on the debate.
Mr. Ensign also made a dinner with Mr. Hampton and another invasive client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Ministry of Transport to agree with a meeting with the name of the aircraft company after the name of Mr. Hampton on the lobby work.
When the first year was reported on the affair, Mr. Ensign apologized his electors and resigned his own, as in the order of the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a monthly stagnation, Mr. Ensign informed reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to achieve the third election period in Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer a goal to investigate his criminal act, Mr Jennifer Cooper, stated that the Senator hopes that the Ethical Commission will follow the Ministry of Justice and complete the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is happy to continue in his selfish work in the name of the Nevada people," she continued.
Foreign call Cheshire turns to Twitter
In the rows of the courtyard, half of them was written.
A minute after a minute, they sent news about a terrible testimony through Twitter.
Finally, the distress says that more than 140 000 news on Twitter were made by violence and attachment of children to a bed in a house that was overtaken.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayese, who was sentenced to murder three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, families, and had to have an official end with the establishment of the death penalty for which the vote voted.
But Mr Hayese's lawyers have already made a revocation with requests and arguments that the court would probably work for years.
One of the most prognossive is that the intensity of reporting about the process - including extended use of Twitter's main journalists - created "cycle atmosphere" and this broadcast, unexpected, unexpected information with detailed details, then reported on decisions in the meaning of the public's view.
This appeal may cause the judge to take care of the question of whether new rules in the court may also be required by the proceeding of new §s.
"So I have lived in this surprise, I think there is real danger that the conclusion of new rubbers in the court affects the rights of the justice process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main council of Mr. Hayese.
The Court of Justice of Jon C. Blue of the State's Supreme Court has strictly refused the statement on the outcome of the last week, with the fact that the communications were "increasingly controlled" and that there are no evidence that would show that the report acted under public influence.
But it's probably not about the last word in this case.
In the entire decade of the court, the reporting of nottoricly known cases may be able to address the question of the process's justice.
In the 1966 Court of Justice of the United States, Dr. Sama Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when in his decision he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, in the process of communications of cups, the "carneval atmosphere".
Some are convinced that this crime was inspiring TV show and the "Upchlik" movie.
Some lawyers said that the revocation of the courts which examined Hayes' sentence of half centuries could be surprised by the argument that new rules may be necessary to determine the way of communication from the courts, which was unpresentable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general deal to fear the impact of new media," in highly investigated cases, John J. Donohue III, Professor of Legal Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a message that said that it was made freely.
Professor Donohue noted that some judges may be aware of the idea that the restriction of non-reduction communications directly from the courts may be more justified.
The case of Twitter is only one of the many accused lawyers of Mr. Hayese, who would be able to argument years to maintain the execution of the judgment.
In the case of Mr. Hayese, for example, the complainant states that in case of Mr. Hayese, it can be a preconceivable way when the judge of Blue refused to test the reactions of potential parents by showing them a criminal photo of threat when the report is selected.
Some of the parents found that they were scared by the photographs of the victim that became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The complainant also states that they will also reject the stability of death penalty and claim that the judge has wrongly revoked the judge who was critical against the State representatives and that he has wrongly put his decision on pressure on the verdict and directed the report to think about the weekend.
They weren't separated.
But their arguments on the impact of the scope of the process can bring the greatest interest.
They introduced the case of the reports in Connecticut in the previous month, and discussed during the electoral campaign of candidates on the fabriker and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the communications chairs continued to reflect emotional flames in this case.
"The day of media, camera and journalists before the court," wrote a lawyer, "there was something that wasn't going to see in New Haven yet, and maybe it was also about a state-statal rarit."
Their focus on Twitter action is controversial.
In the discussions, some journalists claimed that without reporting, it was more disturbing than the reports mentioned in recitals and that the police should, in their view, carry out the field of operations of other processes.
However, some lawyers requested a revocation of courts with often used arguments that social and social changes require adjustments to the courts.
Mr. Hayese's people are trying to make this right.
In their archives, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the case of Dr. Sheppard's judgment, due to the wide effect of the process and wanted to clarify the request that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21th century."
Can the ability to convince the ruin?
After the campaign that was careful for his injury and negativism, this week in Washington has been discovered a small quantity of depression.
Is this the first ruler of real cooperation of two political parties or only illusion of a moment before returning to a side fight in the main city?
The internal negotiation of the President of Obama and the parliamentary leaders has not made any fundamental evidence of the principles to be negotiated during the meeting.
In any case, however, there was a close debate on two parties' opinion differences, as well as the definition of their joint responsibilities, more than another empty episode of the page-completion.
The Central Public Meeting of the President's Deficit Committee was also civilized, even through the political differences that remain between members.
It seems that a close competition has developed one another in a few months a respect that overcomes the ideological destruction that members still share.
And it's pretty unfortunate to say that it started a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in the experimental period - they investigate each other the marks of college and compromise, and they are trying to evaluate the limits of public amendment and voluntary patience towards the renewed side war.
It was therefore also a deteriorated negotiation and its improved evaluation of the applicants carried out with minimum applications or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to make the change of the conditions here last two years.
About the question of taxation, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are far away.
However, the November options prepared Washington for at least Âe.
"There is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They're inexcusable by choices.
The choices shot the side emotions and then they reaped.
It's good."
In some questions, especially those who have to be discussed at the meeting, they have the Republic and the Democratic Chance to find a solution.
Bush reduction on the end of the year has expired, and no one thinks that it's positive.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or everyone, and they continue or temporarily.
Similarly, as a probably compromise regarding non-employed damage only because the republicans cannot see how they support the reduction of taxes for the poor, while they refuse non-employment support.
After a deal in the White House, there is already a more optimistic view of possible agreements in the matters of these issues, together with new starting conferences.
But William Galston of Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation on main issues is needed to lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th Congress calls on ice.
Moreover, it's probably a period of accident, or even unexpected, he said.
"When things are done to be done, the psychology is in short perspective returning to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is in a significant way extended - to bring them into cooperation.
"I'm looking at all things between modernity and 2012 as a steel box when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The D≤s are largely related to the building of a new Republican Employment in the White House and the choices of the tea festivals that helped her to create it.
The Republican leaders now stand before the risk of elevation, believe that they must keep themselves in accordance with their promises and must reduce the expenditure of the government and cancel the new health care law.
These proposed lines are subject to the initial reactions on recommendations regarding deficit, including the reform of the tax law and the increase of certain taxes, the increase in revenue and the reduction of expenditure.
The Community President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and May, according to their opinion, to develop the pressure of the deficit question for a public programme of ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18th Member Commission to present their plan as an official recommendation and, therefore, to combat the number as far as possible.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officers in the report that believe that in cases of financial issues, at least today, small bases or because of compromise.
Galston provides two phases in battle between the White House and the Parliamentary Republic.
The next year will be started in the form of side conflicts when the Republic of Obama will call on the budget, tax and health care for the period of a longer-term cooperation.
What will cause the move?
Public amendments.
There are many evidences that despite pages in the last options, the Americans want to continue to see two parties working together.
It would be possible to move to a patrol, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very carefully followed by the public reactions.
Anyone will threaten the reduction of voices, it will probably change the course and seek compromise.
That may be optimistic view of things.
Parties and directions are today more than half of the ninety-years and show that a more ideological disaster has been created between Obama and the parliamentary Republics than that in the case of republicans and Bill Clinton.
Equality of activists on both sides shall be considered as a preliminary for more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the complaint that has been revealed this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will be a lot of effort on both sides to find common bases in the issues they still share.
The expressed American document counts Moscow as a corruption attack
The management of the city is in the hand of the "kleptocracy" and it continues the part of the taxes and taxes for protection, which come to Kremlin, introduced the American ambassador in Russia in trades from February.
Police and the Federal Security of the service are largely maintaining protective sticks that help to explain high costs for life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal trade but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of birocracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical of the office" - we'll take ours when money starts moving up to the top.
The record sent to Washington by the ambassador John Beyrle was published in the middle of WikiLeaks on their websites.
The record is based on the resources which the name has been edited.
The record was written at the time when Yuri Luzhkov was still older and accused him of a large part of corruption.
In October, President Dmitry Medvedev was revoked, but since that time, we can only follow the minimum changes in cleanness.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelen Baturin, owner of the prominent company, continued to cope with corruption after a lot of years, and wined a few claims for a torture accusation for such a name.
In September, he said to the Russian TV station when he was asked for a demonstrated testimony of corruption, "It's crazy, it's a cup, it's a swimming."
The Russians with absolute conviction that if their company is corrupted, it will be shown to vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details in such a way, and it is in the ambassador report, and it is also unhearted that they would do so diplomates from other countries.
"The Government of the town of Moscow and its associations with criminal lives led some to call her "discussion," and confirm that the government works more as a claptocracy than a government," says the news.
"Criminal elements are more satisfied from the 'Crisha' (terms from the world of crime and mafia, which is meaning 'Streach' or protection), which provides to them the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Inside and the State Representative of the State, as all in the Government of the city of Moscow.
"Analytics identify and trip structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on the top of itself."
"FF Safety Service, Ministry of the Inner and Miles are at the second degree."
"And finally at the lowest level are normal crimes and corruption of inspectors."
"It's an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty places in some areas, because the city does not provide any services."
The report says FSB takes money from the largest fires and the police focuses on smaller businesses.
One source said, "Moscow business owners realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Inner (although they have no more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but also protected by law."
"On this way, protected from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while choosing money is complex, the protection alone can already be taken; even those paying may sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay enough Âe, their trades are closed under different interests.
Medved was talking about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he did only a little progress.
The ambassador news is talking about men of coffee, probably pressured, to Kremlin alone.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must be involved in birocrates," he said in the recent conversation of Georgy Satarov, the director of the Moscow research team of Indem.
" But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because there are no more political classs in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
In other cases, it believes that Russia's corruption costs more than 300 billion dollars per year.
The land is set up to 154 places in recent investigation on the global imposition of the corruption of the non-governmental Transparency International (the land is designed at least to the most corrupt).
The discovery of the report of the American ambassadors, which has been revealed in Moscow until the late dinner hours, has certainly not been invited to the Russian Government of overcome, although only in the way that the Moscow failure may be accused of Luzhkov, it may be the opportunity for Kremlin to argument the solution to the problem.
When the CNN and Larry King were discussed, Putin reported that the documents that WikiLeaks had published could be packs and reacted disgracefully to the statement that the American diplomatic name was Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"It's about all the matter that it's about our mutual consistency, which is the important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think that it would be done with such an arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so nonetic."
The veterinarians of the Red Khmers are required to compare with the past
In the assembly of the light beton teachers, with the shadow of the walls of the Anlong Veng High School, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok, reminded the leader of the Anlong Veng High School.
"All of us here love the Moka."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "division" for its surovity during the Government of the Red Khmers, a leader in this remote Roudy Khmers country in the North-East Cambodge, where he built hospitals, pools and other infrastructures and still lives thousands of former soldiers of this organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Rhode Khmer's government has been delivered, it is also a successful loyalty in Anlong Vengu.
In April, the victim in the forum of truth and the measurement was allowed to be publicly confronted with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government gave a teacher who explained the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations and the Court of Cambodia shall bring together the first judgment of the former member of the Red Khmers, the exhibition of the judgment of a certain leader, the nottoric of the known violent association of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years of negotiation.
With each such progress, there has grown no calm between the Red Khmer Veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts to disturb and their attempts to go back into the Cambodge company.
"In the middle of the former Red Khmery, they are unable to do anything," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation centre of Kambodja, an independent organization who examines the regime.
"For them, life between the Red Khmery was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"He's splitting the family."
During the Government of the Red Khmers in Kambodja, from 1975 to 1979, 1,7 million people were recreated or died by hunger, disease or processing.
When the Vietnamites attacked and joined the Government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and his soldiers passed to the Kambodsian border with Thailand.
There they started the resurrected up to the last movement in 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led party wars from their foundations in mountains and jungles in Western Kambods, while the Mok cultivated stoupence in Anlong Vengu.
But in the middle of the ninety-years, after a peaceful agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Great groups of fighting the Red Khmers began to move to the Government that rejected Ieng Sary's Ieng Sary's release in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died by the natural death in 1998, and the Mok, who endured, was in 1999 to catch with government forces in the small mountains of Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penh Procedure in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Their machines have no longer been concerned about them, the number of former fights of the Red Khmers have fallen into the usual Cambodia's foreign life, and many of them are nostalgic for the time of movement.
Although several Elite Red Khmers have maintained their local government position as a exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as non-agricultural farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefits," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads the public fora throughout the Kambodja, including Anlong Vengu.
"They're circumcised atopical agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were learning without any idea of the consequence of trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who came to the Red Khmer as teenager in 1974, fighted in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before he was born as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmery was good," he said.
"The Mock all enjoyed."
"But now life is hard, because we have to make all of us alone."
The River Court of the Red Khmer also made fears.
At the beginning of the next year, the court will begin to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Khmers.
The Court has to command the leadership and the people responsible for crimes, but it was not said whether it would continue in the four cases.
It was just a little bit to calm the fears in Anlong Vengu.
The recent media speculation was focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a leader in the Province of Banteay Meanchey during the Government of the Red Khmers at the end of 70 years.
In 2007, researchers from the Documentation Centre in Kambodja told that she watched the building of Trapeang Thma overground, a project that probably had lost thousands of needed works.
The last couple of nights I Chaem returned from the work to the field to his tree home to a spyway outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to combine and open shadows through the spread of grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past between the Red Khmer.
If the court would call her, she would refuse to go.
"In Kambodja, the peace is governed and is stable," she said.
"When other crimes will be discovered, there will be war."
Premier Hun Sen, who passed from the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned again that it would come to stability if the court would search for further suspicious, although the experts and history did not agree with it.
"Cambodge has to cover the deep wheel and bury the past in it," he said.
But the conversation with the past is just what Kambodja must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"The measurement in the khmer conditions means blinding the wounds," he said.
"It's our obligation to give these divorced cups of woods, and they could understand."
The Centre issued the first teacher of the Government of the Red Khmerech, has 75 parties and the name of the "The history of the Democratic Kambods".
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as an addition to the student's history of the Ministry of School, which contains less than four pages about the Red Khmer.
Like many people in Kambodja, young people in Anlong Vengu knew only little details about the Red Khmerach, even through the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, student at the Mediterranean School in Anlong Veng said that a new student helps students understand the important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skepticly when he took a book to study home.
"My family refuses many parts of the teachers and judges," he said.
"They're suspecting because they're not sure how many people's judgment will be stumbled."
Such opposite makes a process of measurement more difficult and more difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forum, the teachers and the court are beginning to have an influence, and he has continued.
The Red Khmer here has still a strong cup.
On top in the mountains Dangrek Mountains, the road is grown by a bowl and smoked with a broken plastic cup that leads to a depth of black sacks, covered by a covered beach.
The body of Pol Pota here was burned on a pneu-power-power after his death in 1998.
Noom Sothea, 31th, a mobile seller on the street said he didn't know much about the man who was in this place.
"It's a strong spirit, many local people walk here and pray to him," she said.
Noom Sothea had birthdays and was planned to visit the place of the rest of Pol Pota, where he will bring a bond of the wounded bananas in a plan that will bring her happiness.
Wetland agrees to seem to have its gun resources based on uran
In a surprising victory in the campaign of President Obama on the security of nuclear material worldwide, the white government reported in the middle of their resources to the highly empowered urane, which is a critical directory of nuclear weapons.
The Agreement was published in the joint declaration issued after the security sum of the Ministry for Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarus Ministry of the Sergei Martyn.
The American Government tried to convince Belarus to return to a highly popular urane, and it seemed that the past jaro was hit on the rock.
But the American officers told the Washington Post that in the last two months with Belarus, a couple of firmed operations were carried out to remove 187 free weapons based on urane from a white-wide research facility.
This prepared the ground for the average agreement to remove the rest of the material - approximately 500 litres, according to the officer who spoke under subminational anonymity, because it's a sensitive matter.
The Agreement was shown to be one of the most important results of Obam's 47th National Summary on Nuclear Safety in April on which Belarus was established.
And it was obviously good to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a summit on nuclear security 2012."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Partnership for Global Security, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called an agreement as a "very significant, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that it would ensure all sensitive nuclear materials throughout the world to four years.
Since that time, the American Government has helped six countries to save all its resources of highly embraced uran.
Wetland's going to be seven.
Thousands of countries have affected George W. Bushe's administration.
At Obam's summit of nuclear security, the white president Alexander Lukašenko announced that his people would never give up his uran.
"We have a highly embraced uran - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically based on weapons and less embraced uran," said Lukašenko.
"It's our comodite, we're not going to make shopping bombs, and we're not allowing it to sell anyone."
"We're using it only for researchers, that's all."
However, Bielorussia reached the United States a few months ago and showed an interest in achieving an agreement.
With the commitment to remove the White Uran in October, it was particularly complicated because the material was easily clear, the officers reported.
He was charged on a special impact that traveled more than 1 300 miles to Russian equipment for cleaning and liquidation, the officers said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and the aircraft was carried out, the officers said.
The United States Government for the Programme lost 13 million dollars, a majority of the added to the Belarus research establishment of a less poor uran that is uncomfortable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"All was very carefully coordinated and managed on the basis of confidence," which leaded to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, Officer of the Ministry of Energy Working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for a study on the non-extension of nuclear weapons this year believed that the white-wheel has at least 88 litres of urane used for the production of weapons.
Wetland will, according to the common statement, endeavor to remove its resources until 2012.
The distortions between Belarus and the United States have been spent over all years, especially for the cruel repression of human rights in Luke.
But the central declaration indicates the possibility of progressing.
"We welcome the progress in these global security issues, the United States and the Belarus recognized that more effective democracy and human rights in Belarus are based on improving mutual relations and it is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish Government doesn't work with years of love
The Spanish Government did not do love for the years of transporting the Taliban and the members of Al-Qaida to Guantanama through the Spanish territory, as the sentence of the United States in Madrid was issued in its telegram.
So it comes from the documents given by the Wikileaks server of El País, where it is also written that the first representative of María Teresa Fernández de la Vegova requested the Spanish executive to be informed and "so it could show that he has a suitable supervisory over the foreign airports that passed by the Spanish airspace".
in June 2006, following the communication of the European Council, in which twelve countries were accused of Spain to participate in the violation of human rights, a meeting occurred between the U.S. E. Eduard Aguirre and the Fernández de la Vegova.
The Prime Minister said that the European Council's communication "twought the Zapater Government out of the game" and that Spain did not have anything to hide in this matter.
De la Vegova highlighted that Spain has no problem with the years of secret services throughout its territory.
"They only want to be informed," so that they are not "reached unprepared," Aguirre reports in one of the documents.
The Miguel Angel Moratinos also indicated that the Spanish Government wanted to give this matter as possible as the latest rebellion, but that thing was in the hands of judges had a cabinet about the possibility of influence.
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González informed Velvyslanict that if it is concerned, it does not intend to block the initiative of the judge to request the secretary documents of the National Secret Centre (CNI) and the Defense Minister for the Years .
"This information does not contain any inkriminated folder or sensitive information," explained Velvyslanect after talking to the procuror.
However, the United States were more concerned about "a manifest coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than to dismiss the CNI or the Defense Ministerial information.
"This coordination between independent scientists will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre claims.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the feeding of the U.S. and the Ministry of the Interior of Alfred Pér Rubalcaby, he informed that "although the Spanish judges are very proud of their independence and do what they are going to make as appropriate," he has already given the instruction to their partners, "to avoid dismissed comments with the intention of decreasing the consequences."
He also expresses his concerns about the political negotiation of the Partido Popular Party (PP; Czech Republic of the People - noted) in this matter.
"In spite of its general rational orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will use any signs that Zapater's Government tolerated or intentionally ignored the United States negotiations that could be interpreted as possible human rights violation, even if this discovery could have negative effects for the Government of the United States."
Recognized mother-made-mother moved on the network to the mother's "alterity"
A young woman talked about the kid when she was dead, and had her blog, "Teror after the pocket"
Monica Juanatey Fernández on the Internet calls "Muki".
with this survival she used quickly, she communicated with her sister and at least one friend; both are from the foreign of Noia in La Coruñ, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, a woman must know the emotional life that the ABC journal rebuilds with the testimony of her family members.
In 1998, a thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered in relation to Ivan Tunism.
They walked together one year.
Soon after they went out, she tried to be pregnant.
The man wanted to say if he was his newborn child, but his former friend's never left DNA tests.
You found a new knowledge soon.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby city of Lousam.
Their consciousness was a long time.
The little César lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balear Islands to look for work, the little man stayed with her partner who even came to visit her to Palmy for a week.
However, from the scope of its communication, it is evident that the relationship has fallen.
In March 2008, he's alone at Menorce, and he says, "Alberto is angry that I've gone for work."
"When I told him, he seemed good, but now he realizes that he must be with a small whole day and can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about the message sms that she just got, "I want you to return this month again, or give me the address where I'm going to send you a child."
He said, "If he doesn't like me to leave a little with my mother, I will take him when I come back."
in May, he talks about his return to his apartment: "This week I'm going there, but I'll stay until 19th, because 20th I have to go to work so that I'm not going about this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son to himself.
"Be with whom to be, then with me, and never ever in life I would leave him with someone other than my mother," a doubtful purpose regarding her bad relationships.
There's another contribution in July.
When the message comes out, it is supposed that the child who arrived on the island of the first day of this month, and probably killed 10 is already dead.
"César is happy on one side, but it's not on the other side."
"The one side is with me, and he likes it here, but on the other side it goes almost every day to school."
He's talking about movement to Mallorc.
"I'll go (sons) to the aerodrome, so I'll shoot a little money for a shot."
The seventeenth salutation and complaint.
"The great mouth of Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he didn't know what video he's going on to e-mail, see how he wants, he's going to meet, sex is needed."
"The boy's good, he's going to the aerodrome to learn catalyst."

People would get in Snow 4 Closes and PSCs (Socialistics side of Catalan) to lose 9 mandates
With the outcome of 28 November, the PP party could have the main word on advisers in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcellona.
After the exciting increase of the obtained votes and the number of experienced missions during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalogue PP (Lid Paper of Catalanska) already has a view of general elections, whether or not, its views are more than positive, since the number of votes in the international elections is usually one of the cases of the catalyst elections.
In 2008, the Catholic people received 610.473 votes in general options, while in 2006 autonomous options this number was only 316.222.
Last Week, PPC (Catalanian Leader) was 384.091 vote.
If this visiting trend remains supported by the transfer of votes from PSC and the loyal PP electors, the analysis of this party calculated that if the general elections were made, the PPC could receive 12 missions from the existing 8, the CiU (Convergencia and Union, Czech Shoda and the Union, etc.) would also get 4 mandates (for now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 letters (a.m. 25).
These calculations would be confirmed that Catalan has a fundamental importance for PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Working Party).
According to this analysis of humans, the ERC (Levic Republic of Catalan) would have lost one rapporteur - now he has 3 - while ICV (Initiative Green for Catalan) would continue to have one mandate, where appropriate, another.
However, after the electoral calendar, the nearest delivery will be made in May 2011 in the possibility of general elections, where people may also have a decision to affect the end of the socialist overseer in four main provinces and to changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputation de Barcelona), which is one of the largest budgetary administrators - 661 million euros for 2011.
As nationalists, so people agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose a Councilman in Barcellona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not receive and couldn't even turn to their traditional associations, ERC and ICV.
In view of the debatt of the Republicans, it would not be impossible if this party lost its commitments in the Barcellon Representativeship - because at least 5% of votes should be obtained.
The PP party increased the number of votes obtained in the four main cities and could have a decided impact in Barcellona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in turning in Tarragona, where they ruled together with PP before the present age, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP only received more than 500 votes than PSC, whose older Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met at some occasions.
People also gained other significant advisers such as Badalona, Castell Dels or Reus.
At present, the PP has an engagement in 34 advisers in Catalan and wants to create candidates in the most possible communities.
The catalyst cell has provided the Al-Qaeda organization for thousands of passports
Further than seven arrested in Barcellona, there were three other in Thailand
Seven Pakistanians and one Nigerian who were arrested by the General Information Commissioner of Barcellona, created a džihadistick cell managed from Thailand, which was along with the different groups of the Al-Kaida organization, including "Tygris of freedom of Tamil Ilamu" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", and the second named group was the author of atents in Bombay, in which 106 people were destroyed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Internal Affairs provides a great importance to investigate this matter, aims to ensure the "operation of Kampai" increasing the Al-Qaida padelator apparatus at the international level and "reduction of its operations and capacity".
Researchers believe that this cell could have been active during two years in Catalonia to send thousands of travel passports to Thailand, where they were then paid and then added to groups that constitute criminal galaxie of the Al-Kaida organization so that their "fighters" could travel straight through the border in Europe and other western countries.
This diluted cell was not the only active network in Europe, therefore these investigations have been made outside the Thai Services for other European police units, and it cannot be said that in the next days, other European countries will not be able to take into account the major principles such as the last attack in Barcellona at night.
In relation to this operation (when the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeriac Babatunde Agunbiade) developed further in Thailand, where the Pakistanci Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirië Kijbum.
It was just those men who drive the seat cell from Bangkok in Spain and others in other European countries.
The catalyst network, which was deleted in 2009, was stolen, in particular, to the tourists of the pass which fulfilled the requirements of islamists.
This means that the documents had to be subject to men in 25 to 45 years of age, they had to have validity for a few years and to be without indicated vision.
In the investigated documents, there is not yet known any of the facts that would be associated with the catalogue attainment in Bombaji, although the author of those attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups who have taken the pass robbery in Spain and then identified in Thailand.
However, a few days before this attitude has been sent from the Catalan Translation Agency, some thousand dollars, which were "in" for the purchase of cards to mobile phones, which had been used by the members of the "command", who killed 106 people.
The police already enjoyed a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires the Mass to stop the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC (Lid Party of Catalan) Alicia Sanchez-Camach had the opportunity to submit to Arthur Mass his submission last night, for which it is willing to support its introduction to the President-Generality; these submissions are compatible with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to live economically and to express risking businesses such as the economic agreement that the leader of nationalists wants to take place during his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catholic Peoples met Arthur Mash with the sure 18 missionary crosses received in the elections of the last week, which is more than satisfactory for the acquisition of accommodation, thus candidate to Ciu Âe to at least one of the opposition forms of opposition.
It is possible to agree with the PP that the nationalists would want to keep in Snow, when they will make general elections, but the discussions that lead to the remaining political leaders in those days of Mas with the rest of the political leaders in the catalyst spirit.
It is about the President of PP to obtain its support for the introduction to ́e, "the leader of the Ciu will have to be able to make up with all the objected and liberated evidence," as with the economic agreement - similar to that of the Baskick - which the leader of the Ciu would even give a vote in the reference.
Both leaders would like to enhance the overwhelming political apparatus of autonomous administrations and to reduce parental and donating taxes.
The details of the negotiation on Masov's introduction to the PP Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat will be involved in the part of the PP Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a strong opposition, Joan Herrerou (ICV) and is today meeting Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
Director of the Geriatric equipment ensures that death has not been resulted in the failure of measures.
The representation of the Olot Centre does not exclude that their career killed more than 11 clients
The leading of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave the pressure last night to illustrate the damage caused by the criminal behavior of Joana Vily Dilmé, the career who, while here, was employed, killed at least 11 elderly who were concerned.
The director of this house for the elders of Joan Sala has been delivered by a lawyer, advocate Joan Canady, and has noted that "the desire of La Caritat's house would be able to bring an accusation against the vineyard" responsible for murder, but "the law and responsibility are committed to abandon this process to the competent authorities."
Besides the damage of a good name that this institution may suffer because it has not discovered the criminal activities of the career at times, a great threat to the home of La Caritat represents the current requirements for material disorders, which already calculates the legal representatives of the remaining family.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and that he did not stop killing since this time
The judge ordered the exhaustation of eight customers' body for elders with a doubt that, in many cases, no doctor was able to watch the dead personally, but that, as regards the disease and the bad health status of patients, everything was called on the phone.
La Caritat rejected the nationality yesterday by its director, and stressed that "the lack of measures could not be in any case the cause of what happened."
Representative La Caritat added that "in the case there is no indication that any third person would be allowed to be doubted other than the own accused."
Now the surprised man "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 deaths yesterday and said that the first crime was allowed on August 29, 2009, and for a month and a half he killed the second age.
in this case, death caused too high insulin dose to be caused in the first case when he used the mixture of silent tablets.
Director La Caritat indicated that it is complicated to control the access of personal to medicines.
Inøyotine and cocktail sedative were probably in six cases of nine, which this career used to kill patients in his effort to take them from suffering.
Nevertheless, the analysis that now run in the laborer should show whether Vila does not look for his first victims less cruel death or he killed them by giving a loud, as he already admitted in the case of three murdered women between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat doesn't believe the health facility and do not exclude that the number of murderers can be higher than what he has been recognized and justify their behavior in various versions that Vila sent to the court with the opinion that he must change his acts when it appeared that he killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want to be rights available to be cleared throughout the scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is threatened
The investors reacted to the yesterday threat of the President of the European Central Bank of Trichet, who warned that "grounds should not underscore our ability to respond."
The border differences have been closed with strength and the action of the European Bank has lost more than 5%.
Nevertheless, they should not underscore the ability of the European Central Bank to mislead - the euro just over the critical value.
What happened yesterday, it is typical for the non-liquid market that, although it comes to the decline, is rejected - but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
The investors will take a long time before they lose anxiety.
A month ago, the European Central Bank sent us to take the liquidity rates back today, and tomorrow it will have to be revoked for a quarter for two years.
Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the recovery of the State debt for the inefficiency and elimination of all exceptional liquidity measures within the period and to maintain unlimited access only for a week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the liquidity peace will be "minimally to March" and have a three monthly request with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to ensure the liquidity at least to June.
We also hope that they will continue to purchase debt and that they will even announce its intensity.
If the expectation is not fulfilled, it creates the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue blindly in the Download of the Liquidity Path, God is with us.
It was the same at the spring in May, where they claimed that they didn't even think about the buying of debt, and it came to the market collapses - tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be adequate and sustainable.
In May, she announced that the fifth moon, and in the middle of the middle, she had already buyed many of them, with which she had called for another market breaking.
The last request for a change for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro sold only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous love.
Thus, the rates in Portugal falled down by 30 points below, reflecting the change in the market in which the Trichet said.
In Ireland, the numbers were published by the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent 10,000 million in short-term value papers and other potential 15.000, until the hour has the opportunity to stand with the privacy, otherwise they will be deceived.
Although Ireland has no confidence, since the problem has not been discovered by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable in the context of the aid plan and will help reduce incertitude.
However, the next attack will need the Government to receive the approval of the new budget by Parliament and has not yet sufficient support, so it continues to rule in Ireland.
Angela Merkel measured the tongue of her manifestation to release the pressure in the face for the next meeting of the EU spheres on the 14th, on which it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would show that we are Union and all are on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the rest would like Beethoven's Ode for joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of measures that will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatisation, employment survival measures - to the ear of investors it sounds as four years of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish burst increased by 4.5%, so double than the final European brushes.
The Government's reactions and the Spanish National Banks have been ≤ and convinced - we are obvious of the effect of surprise.
Today, we have a key request for a debt for three years, which will be evaluated by Trichet's effect, for which we hope, there will be a great request that will help to spread the doubts about our ability to refinerate.
Ask a salvation plan would be for Spain's self - sacrifice.
They would give us the preparation that we don't say - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in preparation, three times more than in March - the high rate and the market access would be closed to us.
However, we need to continue to use the Caesar's woman's strategy - "not only to be, but also to look like it."
We can do it.
The President of the Eulen Group attacks the negotiation of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
Bourry in an open conflict in the Alvarez's family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will be attacked after he took it as "very unsignificant", the legal negotiation of El Enebro planned for 16th month and the requested five of his seven descendants, on which these should try to be exhausted and strengthened by the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary José, have a legal group for a new member of their dispute on the control of the part of the company.
The founder of the largest enterprise holding of business services does not appear to be willing to flight in his contract of membership in the Governing Board of El Enebro.
from its Administrative Committee, five of its seven seven seeds, which were called forwards during the meeting of acteurs on 18 January this year, and whose taxes are included in the Trade Register.
The Court of Justice of El Enebro planned for the sixth month of this month, which was approved by the Officer of the Court of Justice No 2 in Madrid, restored the refrigeration in the Alvarez's family hall.
The appeal to the Court shall be until the solution of the only law which guarantees the vote of the Commission.
The last step of Juana Carlose, Pabla, Emila, Marty and Elviry Alvarez's Mezquirizs considers David Álvarez as a "supported wedding of his five children using the courtyards and any legal subject to strengthening and improvement of the negotiations from 18 January, which was completely inadequate".
This argument will be used as a basis for the clearing of the legal attack of this negotiation as "increasingly insignificant".
Only protagonists who are discreetly silent have already tried to call the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Alvarez 100%.
However, the founder of the group, according to family protocols, requires the right to use 51%.
This matter is the key question that the judge will have to decide when changed the question of the judicial attack of the negotiation.
Red Bull triumphs in Form 1 with a secret weapons from Siemens
Software provides completed in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull has fallen into the form 1 series in 2004, his history in this exceptional world is characterized by surprise and success.
In the beginning, no one took too seriously the possibility of this new income team, even though there was a recent trend, all had a triumf of Ferrari Fernanda Alons.
Unless they wanted to decrease the horse capabilities of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibility of Renault engine that moves his car, in the world Formule 1 was born a legenda - " secret weapon", which the multinational Siemens placed in Red Bull's hand to do so a victory team.
In the ability, there is an executive software simulating travels that the German company introduced to the market in 2007 for very remote car sports.
Such a PLM, this powerful software device, was used to carry out mounting lines in production campaigns throughout the world, energy travels and high accuracy devices.
Its goal is to reproduce or simulate the process before it is actually created, which can be avoided from unusual amounts and expenditures.
PLM facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi airport or the most passive useful Nissan brands.
Siegfried Russwurm, the leader of the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this software device has enabled Red Bull to succeed "for a few hours, at the same time real time" to modify and complete, which is differently detected during the campaigns and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 there were about 10 technicians who were able to carry out maximum three or four completes during one period.
in the Red Bull team today works at 180 highly identified professionals with the executive information technology that analyze and support each type of change of vehicles.
The leader of Siemens explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull vehicles with the exception of the engine that Renault fully corresponds.
Materials, fuel, dynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes may be transferred from local reality to age during less than 24 hours thanks to progressive manufacturing systems using laser and highly highly growing cars.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of 40 million dollars representing the maximum, which each team of Formule 1 can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull designed a 50 km from London the carrier of spike-ups to carry out and manufacture their train vehicles.
It's about two buildings in which I'll be limited to visit - especially to journalists.
Everything that's playing here is considered a "great secret".
The list of participants in this project reads 580 people, mostly two pilots - Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull is in Form 1 without doubt a fresh Shampion Sebastian Vettel.
In the case of the incondicional ≤s that the label of energy drinks has placed in its capacity in the trailing areas, however, hides other protagonists whose aid is unvaluable, and no one knows them.
The manufacturer boss Steve Nevey stated that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in research and development of vehicles contributed to 50% winning and the rest was the debt of drivers.
This condition has currently changed and is expected to succeed from 85%, while the pilots contribute to 15%.
Nevey recognises that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by an excellent technology, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP shall make 20 own businesses in cooperation with local distributors during two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes, she opened her first exclusion in Barcellona.
This undertaking will be the first of the 20 networks of negotiations 80 to 100 m2, which this overnational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These trades will also be located in 16 already existing business homes such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
The Vice-President of the Spanish HP Helena Herrer introduced as an example of a new interrupted sale in the Gran Via of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North-American company adopted a plan for the establishment of 200 sales places in Europe until 2013, which includes 20 Spanish trades.
The sales were opened last week in Bukuresti (Rumania) and Belarus (Serbska), so trade in Barcellona is the third.
Mr Herrer didn't want to see where other sales would be opened, however, admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
The ruler, also conducting HP personal systems, has ensured that trade opening philosophy will continue to be the same with the use of local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North-Ame company is here to consult the exclusive design of sales (with products which I have interactively tested) which will be identical in Europe.
Furthermore, HP is also involved in the assurance of the trade staff.
Helena Herrer recalled that it would be a franchising, and she stressed that the exclusion of the network is sold to "building the prohibitive service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing, management, relief services and even threats".
The trade in Barcellona is part of the pilot pioneer program at the world level, aimed at resolving the problems with computer devices in security.
Online service is connected to the technical centre of Side in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to resolve problems that may be different to two days."
"This system is designed specially for small and medium-sized enterprises and for run-off clients, since the large companies already have contractual technical assistance services," Helena Herrer said last night.
Sabadell's assuming that he's "forbidden" for three years to his competitors millions of clients
More optimistic than other boss, delegated member of the Bank Bank Bank Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be proud for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and provides the end of the war.
However, it is calculated by the reduction of rates which will be attempted to compensate with the compliance of bank taxes and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to get a million private customers for three years.
Sabadell found the way to use the next three years and can survive in unfortunate economic submissions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The goal is, besides the survival without need to return to public aid in FROB, to get a share in the market by subtotaling a million of new private customers - respectively 700,000, if those who will eventually leave the bank - because until now and the establishment, the small and medium-sized business and biggest businesses were more than detailed customers.
This year the bank has already received 250,000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Her share in the market is in relation to private clients 3.5%, while it is more than 10% in fire clients.
The following basic ideas of the plan 2011-2013 are the commitment to production, or it is also to be said of silver, with a view to reducing the costs of the bank’s challenges when presenting the expenditure for the period.
A few banking institutions are at this time demanding to set up objectives and to publish them because the financial crisis has changed all the world banking plans.
Sabadell will close its program Optima, set four years ago, although he was plying three years ago, but the marketing requested an extension for another period.
Clients who are going to go away from associated will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola held that 2011 would be "swak and very important".
In fact, the way from the crisis to Spain "will be deteriorated."
Furthermore, in two or three years, it will be "very uncomfortable to create employment", which has been added to the banking sector's survival.
And although the war - which decreases the margin, the price of the risk payment by banks and partners to receive liquidity is already moved to the prices of credits, which compenses the reduction of margins.
"The Liquidity and financing theme is structural and will represent a deficiency factor."
"We haven't closed the couch yet, but the differences are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday orders to be decreased and increased the prices of differences - see CincoDias of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the trends in the banks are "before decreasing", but there is "concurrent mec".
The Sabadell Bank's plan is based on organic growth, but as a group usually does not exclude corporate operations.
It does not make sure that in Spain they will "require greater size".
"The next year will not remain on a stone stone," he assured.
It confirms that the needs of the situation are "very decreased" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter between the red numbers.
And it shows that FROB can supplie funds in the market before new measures.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closement of the markets, it continues to represent a serious problem of what some banks predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but in the case of what was in June, it is possible to get shortly financed using the repo of rates, which disturbs the crisis.
CECA excludes the additional volume of fuses associated
The General Director-General of the CECA refused to have further vulnerfuses to be coherent in yesterday, and he was still on the ability to reorganize the sector.
When the Spanish association process was restarted, there were several institutions which assured that this first phase would be uncommon and wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confecie associated (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday claimed that the new wheel of these operations should occur.
"I believe that the fuses have already been carried out, Cajasolu's incorporation in the Bank Civica group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening are contracts."
"The majority has been completely performed; it is possible that we go to 13 or 14 institutions, but all the large processes are already ready and protected by the Spanish National Banks, which worked very well in this matter," noted the director.
In its statements on the ADEA meeting (Association of leaders and executive officers of Aragon - after.) Olavarrieta highlighted that the concentration process is consequently "the highest of my ability and we must be very peaceable, as it appears in payments that have not now been opened in business plans with the Spanish National Bank," he explained.
"From 45 associated with the average volume of assets of 28.000 million to 17 and 75.500 million is a process that does not have in the history of comparison, reducing the beginning of the institutions by 62% to be more efficient and falling in accordance with Basilean," he stressed.
Olavarrieta recognized that " there is a number of too happy views on the lack of the process", which indicate "success of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to say that we have to be before the end of the year in term."
Director-General CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assures Spain had the most precise financial system in Europe and "probably" worldwide, and he condemned the "sufficient knowledge" to those who doubt it.
The Director noted that in the current economic competition we could "be quiet" concerning financial institutions and the compatibility of the system which has been enabled to "very important" concentration process and which continues "the highest of my ownness".
He also recalled that the Spanish banknote was very well out of the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapater and Red German lines
Berlin decided to break the euro, but he set submines for the whole Union.
The pressure on the markets was due to two government responses.
On one hand, José Luis Zapatero sent a new adaptation measures, from the reduction of taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private deficiencies agencies or the derogation of 426 euros for unemployed unemployed, until 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and airport management, etc.), the airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgadova with the support of the former Prime Minister Felipa Gonzál, on the other hand, joined critics to the officer Angely Merkel's responsibilities for the resolve of the current crisis.
How can you interpret this inspiration?
Previously it is said that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
Instead, it is another point in the complicated process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what his future should be, which suggests the idea of maintaining old traditions, which is maintained by a large part of the remaining members.
The face in the face of European opposition in Germany begins to speculate about three possible ways of crisis.
They represent a strong euro part of which would be Germany, such as the Russia or the Netherlands, while the southern States would leave the monetary zone.
The second is returning to March - although it can now be like a shif, this version has a large support for publicity, close to 50% of the people.
The third option is, according to Germany, the processing of euros with a more economic supervisory, the budgetary accuracy, the amounts for providing countries, the possible payment rates for some of them, and with the extension of the possible costs for the regulation for the private sector.
The German position is fair and already defines a period of time, so no space is now.
Firstly, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission undertaken deficits in 2009, the German Government went out from the hand of the constitutional reform to protect them since 2016.
This was the first sign of the dispute between what Germany considered the right (the plans of fiscal accuracy and the stability of public funds) and the practice of its European partners, inter alia, France.
Secondly, this Central European country showed that Markel had painful distorted the decision on the salvation of Greece.
It was already the subject of criticism, but it is true that the political consensus in Germany and public opinions that were also published were strongly against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel revealed the same statute when she requested reform of the European Union Conventions so that it could be enabled to save some Member States and, rather, that private trustees should be able to take part of the costs.
This statement was interpreted as an anti-European, since the Irish crisis and all remaining.
However, it was approved, although in some form, and during the next months, the reform process of the Union should be monitored, which should be enabled since 2013.
Germany had a red line that would not be able to overcome.
And it tells us all that, although it is now necessary to make measures that, obviously, are not too agreed, from this date it will be with the old operation of the euro end.
The 2013 will represent the birth of new monetary zones in which States which violate the rules will be firmly penalized and may be required to report the payment release, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany points out that we need to take a strong way of growth by enhancing the level of strength and investment, deteriorated injuries, improved productivity and competitiveness, and reserves.
Another opportunity based on search and building, with a deep range in the payment balance, which has been governed in Spain's growth years, is not simply able to tolerate.
It's the offer.
And they made a mistake when they did not understand it.
It is not only about the renewal of public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much stronger.
And the worst thing is that for these submines, we could be able to get out of itself.
I hope that these current turbulences are more calm.
And that we'll use the opportunities we'll give up to yar 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood it and his two declarations (reforms promised after meeting with big businesses from last Sabbath and the new measures yesterday) makes it realize that, despite the criticism of Merkel's address, the way of thinking was to make things good.
Yet, the red line that Germany was running is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move with her.
And the possibilities to be considered can not be abandoned by the euro full of too series of countries.
Well, Germany will help us to say that he warned us.
Sports and rules of detention
Finty, which Alonso and Ramos were predicted in a band with Ajax, shows the confidence of never being intentional to avoid crime.
The based exhibition of two Realu Madrid players (Xabi Alonsa and Sergia Ramose) in the ship of Ligy Masters against Ajax, of 23 November, caused the inquiry sea to be issued on whether this is an unfair behavior and whether the EUFA should not eventually be destroyed by both battlelists.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the storage (which had been wined) player named one after another, they lost time in the moment when they had to play a faul to produce a judge, and he showed them the other yellow card.
In this way, both players will comply with the pre-descripted sentence in the next contrast against Auxerre - while Real Madrid will end in his group in front - and they will be able to continue in the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of the EUFA trainer José Mourin's sentence for two charges and the provincies of players have received money repayment.
The exhibition of yellow cards for obtained submines is not a new practice, but it is at least running in the battle.
It is so extensive that it is part of etosubal, so rules that are not written, but are followed.
A part of the debate in this case occurred thanks to her team Real Madrid (which in his himnally glorifys the happiness and honour, and who has already been punished for the acts of his players), and as it seems, also by dramatizing the Mourin, which thus adds to his long history of the comedian and the producer of another episode.
In any case, the debate is about whether this type of negotiation, which is not expressly prohibited, is in conjunction with the sports principles, so whether in these ways the rights are incurred; it is, in fact, the action respecting sport and the rules which the sense of the sport is likely to try to deal with.
It decides what kind of damage such conduct affects the sport of the spirit.
One of the aspects of sports behavior is the physical inappropriacy of players that have not been destroyed in these cases, whether it has not reached a violent game.
Another of these features of pure games is to avoid players with their crimes to face the team against the advantage - which isn't here.
Then the paradox to players of Real Madrid is the fact that what we normally characterize as a forest or a detention of the rights has not reached a deterioration of the rules to avoid sanction, but this behavior should be the most apparent to the purpose of the criminal.
They're waiting and they've got the crime.
However, another question is how the victories will benefit from their intentional crime.
Here, it is necessary to note that the co-operation is not in a disappointed position and that it does not achieve any benefit in the current repository, because the evident result is that the team will have less players.
And it's not even a useful strategy in another stock, because the club can count with these players.
The result is obviously that players will start another stage of the Ligy of the Masters without a care, which could threaten their ability in the future department.
However, it is the benefit of the perspectives and with a real degree of inadequacy, so for the first view, the team can be eliminated, and without prejudice to this negotiation, the player will be rejected, and they will go into the second round of the card, in which there is enough for a card less than in the first round.
So how the cars are going to continue, it's totally good if it's the benefit.
Shortly and well, these acts are not against sports and spirits, whose part is to make a strategic decision that allows maximal benefits under the rules.
in the case where we stay here, the players should not have intended to avoid the consequence of the judgment (which would be the case of the rules), but they have chosen more than when they would.
They have made strategic decisions without avoiding crime or fleeing from it.
Although there is no border between the confidence and the detention of the rules, I believe that in this case it was particularly regarded as a consequence.
It seems that the polymenic comes from two days: because it was two self-explications and because of the way the transfer of instructions to their conduct.
The damage of sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as ethical.
Warning proposal for the organizing of nightmates in Barcellona
The calendar dictator concentrates the lavin reservation years on 16 and 17.
It soon comes to the celebration of low-leaving employees who want to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
Similarly, as the Turkish med or lottery, with the income of the income of the pre-natural dinners that are still acting as a oxygen bomb for restaurants and equipment for free time in Barcelona, however, the crisis has developed in the fight against the customer's reduction of prices: however, everyone wants to lose 20 to 30 euros for food, the interested employees and associations of this sector are agreed.
In order to complete the compliance of the numbers, the calendar was concentrated this year (which the Sweet Day was fallen on Friday) to request a week from 13th, with which the booking lavine was raised at the day in the wheel (16s and 17), while the previous week was not almost any operation.
As it has been since 2008, the beginning of the missing years, it is a lot of fires that collective dinners have been canceled from the budgetary debt.
To avoid abandoning traditions, many employees pay a breakfast on dinners from their own caps.
Without a view to the ability, many require prices at the border of the lowliness, strong president of the Restauration Association Gremi de Restauration de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
Representant of the pattern of restaurant equipment does not at this point consider the famousness of this month.
"The people's thinking well before they're doing a booking."
"They're trying to get out, but about the price theme, they're careful," he adds.
The trades will be good to those who offer quality and good service for the price of the benefits, and it claims that by the crisis, the clients have trends to go down, and the rate of the applicant wants to lose about EUR 25.
The research in various equipment shows that the greatest effort to request reservation is at evening 17.
The Group of Soteras reports a booking boom for this Friday, whereas the most requests are at rates to 30 euros, which have reached the proposed menu of which the total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another important company, which is Andilana, reading 16 equipment in the town (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other), brought the speciality of the aeroplane calendar more time booking and from the beginning of November.
"We have made possible and impossible, and we have maintained prices from the latest year, and our menu, from which everyone should choose, move from 19,95 to 30 euros," he states.
In the group of ANS Groups, to which El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and all are reading 23 companies, remain optimistic after the growth of profits from the second half of the year and have relatively solid views on the dinner markets.
The resources of this company highlight that 18th will also be a difficult day, since the pre-natural celebrations will be made between the friends.
to their six group menus, they added a banquet menu, with a budget of EUR 30 or more, as they mentioned in comparison with the latest year of hosts to lose 10% more exchange for other items such as coffee (Spanish wine - afternoon).
They also mentioned that companies are already found that call their employees again, and it seems that the size of groups is something more useful.
Vice-President of the company Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as Asociace bars, restaurants and center of free time in Barcellona) En · Goma's starting to see the end of the tunnel and states that the number of reservations has been "leavened", although the clients "speak at the maximum".
He didn't stop this injury or during the holiday celebration, but he showed the payer.
Pakistanian Nuclear Program was born a great disaster in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "better temper than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the United States of Pakistan and the Ministry of the United States have been published by the Wikileaks portal confirms an extraordinary disaster that exhibits the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
According to explicit and significant details proposing about the scope of communication and the view of the representatives of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between both States in relation to nuclear security, instead of to increase, "is on access" and that the sustainable Asian country will produce "more nuclear weapons than any other State".
The speciality of the Pakistan nuclear program - that his weapons are not mounted, but are consistent of the works that their destruction in the case of an attack - represents one of the main divisions of Washington's care.
This calculates well-soundly in Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before visiting the national security adviser James Jones: "Nearby some nuclear equipment in front of the territory under the control of Taliban, data distribution of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials."
The increased number of persons associated with nuclear arsenales and the program of controlled shooting is not now observed only in the United States but also in Russia as a widespread and representative.
"Pakistan had to have a staff with a close religious faith; in the case of the level of education and culture, the extremist organization had more opportunities to recruit people who would work in nuclear shooting programmes or programs," expert Jurij Korolev from the Russian Ministry began to meet with their protests from the United States.
The largest news documentation published by Julian Assange's server is the lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the issues of the spread of nuclear weapons and increased time for Pakistan production of these weapons.
Species issued to the ambassador in May, which communicates with Pakistan as "frustering", states: "Transparence is often not existing; the offers of help remain without response or are rejected."
in the next report, Peter Lavoy, the worker of the national reporting services for South Asia, states that "and through economic disaster Pakistan will produce nuclear weapons as well as any other state in the world."
Petterson also requests Washington to make a very good explaining during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayaniho Army Chairman, "they have been very well explained," that "Akystan Army must be closed with the silent support of terrorist groups."
She's Chief Wikileaks
Both names a highly established work responsible for combating terrorism to eliminate new information income.
Interpol issues a "red call" with a goal to track and determine where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder of Julian Assange makes a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be real.
Interpol announced "inmoral call", such as re notice, to "localization and monitoring of movement" Assange.
However, it's not a classic order to keep.
Moreover, this call is not new, but is dated on November 20th.
And it doesn't have anything to do with the last outcome more than four million diplomatic documents, but with accusations of sexual disturbance that Australian leads to Sweden.
In addition, the legal representative of Wikileaks Mark Stephens' creation assures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assang."
It was on November 20, when the international police assembly, sitting in the French Lyon, issued this order to request Sweden, however, did not publish it until yesterday when he received authorisation from the Swedish authorities.
For this purpose, 188 countries have the Interpol order to identify or locate Assange "with the aim of entering a temporary link and delivering it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of persons relating to the red challenge, many Member States, as explained by the organization, consider that the order of notices is to be enabled to carry out - it must be assured by the National Police Directory - especially in the case of the Member States who have a deteriorated agreement on the issue of detained, such as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange would probably be taken into account.
This step was deteriorated by Assenge's lawyers who published writings yesterday, where they declared that a ninety-year-old founder Wikileaks had been willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities using video.
They also claim that Assenge requested and then received the authorisation to leave Sweden from the procuror of his case, compared to the Legendary Lavrence by Pavlovic Berio, the head of Stalin's security.
"That's hero and not legal investigation," says the letter.
While the whole world looks for her - and his mother from Australia hates the innocentness of his son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he doesn't still.
On Monday, he presented Skype from an unknown site interview of the Sheriff Time magazine - in this discussion he requested the Demision of the Ministry of the United States of Hillary Clinton.
"If it is shown that it was responsible for the United States diplomates to conduct spinners in the United Nations and to violate the international contracts signed by the United States, it should be delayed," he said.
His view was rejected by the printing speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who implied the demand of demise as "smile and absurd".
"I don't really know why we should be concerned about the view of the individual operating the website," he declared for the CNN.
Only Obama believed the highly established work of the responsible for fighting the terrorism, Russell Travers, to restrict other documents.
The aim of the Chairman Barack Obama's proposal to stop adding Assange to the importance is contrary to the views that are published by politicians and commentaries in these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will preside the National Security Committee since January, requested the Ministry to examine the possibility to include Wikileaks between the terrorist organization, "to be my ability to stumble and stumble everyone who would contribute financially or otherwise to help them."
Moreover, Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who declared Assange should be killed, and then he had to revoke.
"The two should write a recompense or use a free aircraft or something like that."
He who didn't excuse was Mike Huckabee, a baptism priest, an ex-Arkansas, and a potential candidate to the president.
"Whoever is in the government, who is responsible for the outcome of information, has allowed the consequences and any other crime than the correction would be too slow," said Fox at the station
Puigcercos looks for ERC quiet "smoking" on the Caroda pregnant
The Republican leader will enable the secret vote to the side of his detention.
Huguet has more plural executive and end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercos obviously found a recept to fight with some internal revolt already in the ERC lines (Levic Republic of Catalanska) which was unnecessary to lose 11 cases and half of votes.
The president of the party is that his gesture regarding demise seems to the former leader Josepa Lluíse Caroda-Roviry inadequate, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as his own leader, and that he cannot absolutely do such anxiety as he had with other strange prouds.
Therefore, the leader of Levice will try to get new criticisms through the mutualization that will help him to turn to general elections.
First of all, Puigcercos noted yesterday that more than 200 members of the State Committee will be able to express secretly to his detention in Âa.
Helping voting letters, I'm not taking up my hands.
Caroda's prosecutors will want to submit a criminal vote to the Chairman, so they will be able to act without fear of the offensive measures.
The boss wants to avoid the divorce and detail of his person.
in some discussions he stated that he would not be considered confirmed by half of votes and one more, but added, without determining the percentage that it would also not be a good result "by Bulgaria".
Caroda's stomachs ask for the President more than to give their own available -- which they consider as a gesture that does not have any weight, because Puigcercos controls the greatest authority in the springs.
However, because they do not have enough ability to disturb demise, they will try to implement the plan from now to May.
It is therefore expected that the elaboration of a strategy reorientation document which will lead to vote by the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercos's exchange for this promise to move the congress already on the basis of 2011.
The leader of ERC declared that "multifoldness" damages the stability, and that its goal is that the organization once is able to work his spending work outside the closed doors.
in this context, it seems to be a significant article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercos's ideology, this adviser for innovation took for the ready thing that the leader would be confirmed "by a number of goals".
And he named them five, from which two come.
The "composure" of the executive is to represent at least 90% of members, which also means to include new faces from the Carod sector.
The second goal may be a big news.
Huguet claims that ERC is completely aware of the meeting as a functioning mechanism.
It thus fights for reforms that my assembly should be held by the delegates chosen by voting.
With regard to the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political system, it is the aim of Puigcercos team, which has already been fighting in this direction in the last two centuries.
However, the critical meeting of 2008 decided that the meeting should be adopted at the Special Congress on Reforms.
This matter is still unrelevant, since the internal party has reflected the solution of this matter.
Now, without critical sectors, it could be a moment to be a suitable moment to re-employ this matter and try to close it once again.

China holds its goal to reduce glass gases
The representative of this country in the United Nations on climate changes, COP16, assured that its country developed exceptional efforts to reduce carbon rates, and stated that it continued to reduce its promise to 2020 with 40 to 45% of glass gas.
China will keep its promise to reduce the rail gas from 40 to 45 per cent in 2020, ensuring Su Wei, the representative of this country to the United Nations on climate changes.
In its first public exhibition on the 16st of the United Nations Framework Convention on the Change of Climate Su Wei, its country has developed an inevitable effort to reduce the carbon rates and to change its priority.
He said that his country had already invested 245 million dollars during the last four years in the effort of reducing rail gases.
He noticed, however, that China does not change its objective and will continue to work together with the international community.
He pointed out that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institutional building and pilot programme support.
In all of these points, the progress, including the latest approval of the new Energy Law, which includes the objectives of reducing rail gas reduction.
He further highlighted that the Federal Authorities in China cooperated coordinatedly with the authorities of the provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives regarding energy support, energy efficiency and reduction of poverty.
Following that, as he has communicated, it has been completed or has already been completed by various several years of plans financed by both the Chinese government and by governments of other States.
For example, it was the case of the programme for energy efficiency, which has been introduced during the last five years, which has received investments from the United Nations, governments and private initiatives.
The provincy project of climate changes is also running, further the draft exchange of aircrafts for adequate wheels and the mixing and adaptation projects.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the professional adviser of this country for climate changes, made China's efforts more effective than generally thinks.
For example, he estimated that the glass gases of one population represented in China 6 tonnes, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of the population.
She also developed an unprecedented effort in relation to energy use - for example, in the last five years, it increased the energy efficiency of 20% and expected that further progress would be achieved by 2020.
Legal exhibition Espina: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Action National, Czech Republic of the National Action - subsequently appealed) stated that the former President of this party is authorised to request the National Order Commission of its rights.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exhibition of Manuela Espina Barrientose was determined and that the former president of this party is authorised to return to the National Order Committee and to request its rights.
in the discussion that was arranged before the introduction of the state of Gabine Cué Monteagud, said that Espina's exhaustion is, in any case, a decision adopted at local level.
"It's about the autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonar."
"Man Espino has the right to return in his case by the complaint to the Request Commission for the decision made by the competent authority," added.
He further explained that there is no time to think for 2012 and that it has never been at the negotiating table on the presidential candidate of the aliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN would come out of the internal options of the following 4 and 5.
"This (aliance in 2012) is the theme which never was at the negotiating table, at least not in the time, was the purpose of local elections that were successful and fulfilled its owner," he subscribed.
The President PAN said that there is 71 years of dialogue on his side, and therefore, "We do not treat the internal competition, but we are hard to strengthen us," added.
He said that the Committee would be able without debates to choose the best President or president, which the PAN serves for three years, so he transfers the staff to which the committee determines.
"So I'm absolutely quiet and free, everyone of these five, I'll give the president's office with courage."
He said that the income that the party has mentioned in the last elections of July will be reflected in the future states, although "not yet time to think for 2012".
"Now it is necessary to deliver Gabina Cué to this job."
In this regard, he highlighted that these three governments who have roots in the alians in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloe will represent a flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, since "they are placed in many expectations and complaints, and I am sure that Gabino is acquired of these expectations."
When we asked her about the critics of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czechish the Revolutional Institutional Party, etc.) for his manifestations within four years that ruled, César Nava called the Prime members to think about the six-year-old ex-presidents of Ernesta Zedilla and Carlose Salinase de Gortari.
"When the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the Government of Foxe and Âderon, so let them be retained, let them go out of their olive," he admitted.
It stated that the leader of the federal executive power has the right to express himself as he did during the manifestation of the National Auditor, because there is no rubic or censure used in this country.
Obama promotes the Twitter law to support students without documents
"If you think the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators be able to accept this law," the American President tweeted on an annual social network.
President Barack Obama today with a contribution on his personal social network Twitter joined national mobilization to support Dream Act law, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators be able to accept this law," said Obama.
His short report warns on the Internet link to a comprehensive document that requests the public to connect the senators immediately, since the vote on this law is close.
"Because the vote is expected to run quickly, now there is a moment, let your opinion be disappointed," she points out.
The report was published after that 42 Republican senators threatened to block any legal approval, if any extent was approved for the reduction of taxes from Bush's era and the financing of the government.
Such blocking, announced by letter signed by 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote on Dream Act and other projects, such as the new connection with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons called START.
When questioned about the republican blocking of the Dream Act and other replies, the President's speaker stated that, as soon as the fiscal subject is resolved, I would be able to set up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe it's still enough time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax matter before the end of the year..."
I believe that we can reach agreements in this matter at some time and then we will be able to plan a series of final issues," he said.
The Democracy Leader of Senate Harry Reid announced in the attack that he would request "the vote on the conclusion of the debate" concerning the Dream Act law, so the legalization of students without documents could be voted in the senate from the next quarter, although it is more probably the next week.
The Senator approval of Dream Act or the "American dream" law would legalize a number of 800 thousand young people who got to the United States 16 years ago, inhabited in the country during the last five years and were adopted in the higher education or military institution.
However, the chairmans have to approve 60 votes, so they are helping some of the Republicans, so the organization of its proposals will carry out intensity and agitation in order to ensure the approval of this law.
Democracy, which the Dream Act supports, has 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has made his support to this law.
This is why the drama project members will receive a number of republicans for the case that other democrats would decide to refuse us.
Among the Republican Senators, with which the most common staff, are Senators of Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as a repository Senator from Florida George Lemieux, who supplemented the mandate of Senator Mela Martínez.
Other republicans who have supported Dream Act in the past are Orrin Ha's of Utah and Kay Bailey Hucionison from Texas, but they have told you that the next will not support it anymore.
The next republican who supported us, John Mccain, has not yet been present at this point.
Although the Snow Representatives are attached to another version, according to the number of analytics, the Dream Act will make the greatest of the senate.
with a finger entered into a finger ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "inserting finger into ́n" is a period of Czechish "building the bottles on the head - after.)
The second round of the cycle of Rejoice in the language was a change where literary gala of representation
"I understand this in the language, but... Finger in the language? What is expected from me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Assessment from the language, cycle that celebrates the writing in the Spanish language, and whose question was used for this opportunity as a subtitle (on the other board, they explained the theme of Sex in the language, explained).
The finger to the "we bring us into anxiety", the argentin writer of the public, which was mostly covered by young people who were meetings at the International Minimity of Guadalajar, to listen to this debate at the chair, moderated Marisol Schultz, and with Valenzuel's, Sergia Ramir, Mayry Monter's and Luise Garcíi Monter.
Louisa Valenzuel readed the text that was implied by Gonzalu Celori, and the Schultz later indicated as a wonderful story in which Louisa was first to be a protagonist who, when looking for the knowledge of the "rane" comes from the doctor to the doctor who doesn't answer, even though it's the same story.
The infectionist is convinced: "The patience is not my strong side, maybe it'll be myself."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breathe in the road, but explained that it was not a deep termine, it is a psychoanalytic that discovers the secret: "The wound represents it very divorced and the symbolic is the name."
The protagonist was quite awake and concluded that "of course it was able to learn so much that it was so disappointed and that it doesn't exist", but it was convinced that the joy and stress in the language must go together in the hands.
The writer of Valenzuel played with murder.
Nicaraguac Sergio Ramírez also went out with a beautiful report called "Gravala Invence", in which the ring was not in a named named, but at one time it appears.
with the elements of the magic realm, the magic statement of the glorious monster, who played darkness, brought back people who went far, or who made the honour that a girl lost, this story that then turned to speak America, a big Romanian, in which his own cronikers who told her since the beginning were missing, and here is quoted by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises the overcome of the reporting of the building facilities.
"Cervantes, who found us all (scrivers), had been mixed with a finished witness that was presented in stories as a story, but in other ways, it was never able to tell America's story with such education, which even shot students."
However, he highlighted, "they are fools and lies who have greater fantasy" and just where the ability is and where they do not know anymore what the story belongs to one group and what the other is reaching the fiktivity of their top.
It's actually called "cervantov tradition".
"Thank his link, we have what we have."
Mayra Monter then highlighted and appreciated the diversity of interpretation that the invitation of the International Nibbles Government enabled its word to the Prince.
The Cubaan-Portoric writer showed her finger on a great social violence that passes through her country - and shares it in Latin America - and it is a result of business disputes and sales of drugs.
"I think the good thing, good poeze and good songs are closed by the silent compromise, which, of course, is not intended," she said after the fact that the reality of the reality is communication and the dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
The Spanish boss Luis García Montero closed tonight, whose exhibition also placed "on this finger to the writer's responsibility."
He said that in the world that lives in fast, also in intellectual habits and controls, which surprises dogmatisms, it is expected that "the small no is hidden after every attack, and after every delay it is a small yes."
"And they were the gentlemen of our thoughts and realities we have to color: and to color means to put a ring into a ring many times and to force the only ones that are much more convenient, as he thinks in carriatures, red whites, in fixed ideas and without colors, and to complain the authorities that prefer this black world," he suggested to support the meaning of writing.

Ruben Omar Romano reads three deficiencies in the final, during the career, he lived good and bad, but has already been able to reach three opportunities for a decisioning series, but until now he left with a non-constituted, and this is why this chance is an extraordinary chance.
Argentine must have satisfied silver medal, remained a step for the winning and played a carefully with the same team of the following finals.
As a trainer, the Santist strategy reached its first final in the tour of Opentura 2002, when he had in the hand of the Club of Morelia, with which he set up in total 4-2 against Toluce; then in Turnhour 2003 he repeated to the decision-making duty, and thus played it with the total skin 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
With the Santos Laguna club in Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against "Devils" from Toluca, Ruben again suffered a hurt, although his team was playing against "Sensors" (a further survival of the Deportivo Toluca club - post.) after 210 minutes of games undecisively 2-2, after a series of criminal shoots, he had two opportunities to save the title, but finally his three players were on 11 steps and thus suffered to return to 4-3.
Ruben has already spent two finals against the Red Devils from Toluca and one against the Monterrey, his future rival, so he would have dismissed the same sentence and released the curse, and could so first celebrate the title, even though he says that it is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want the lamat'a, this is for the club, for your obligation, and the title would, of course, be for me, but the first is the most important," said the trainer when he was questioned about the number that is speaking in the final against him.
in the live memory, the previous final in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "We have learned that until the decision is unscriptible, we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared for action, as well as players, because the past with two penalties, we were already ready to go out to celebrate, and I think we have learned in this until the end of the depth, we cannot celebrate."
It doesn't care that this series could decide in criminal shootings, they will give to your players: "You never try to reach the series of crimes, you're trying to end in normal times, but sometimes there's no other option, and it's necessary to be prepared for it, in the past turn, we were prepared, desirablely, but this time has taken a bad thing, perhaps because of the nervous or anxie that we felt when it was in our hands, but we've lost it, and we hope that this time will not come to something like that."
Romano has the chance of stop being the other and trying the first glory that the titles offer.
The United States amend the rules for the promotion of visa
People will have to return to the Service Centre for Visa Requests before talking to the Consular Division; the costs will be lower and shorter.
Since 10 January 2011, the visibility process of the United States and Consulates will be changed.
with a new procedure, the applicants will have to be returned to the Centre of Visa Services (returned from ASC) before negotiation in the Consular Division.
The personnel from the ASC will remove the applicant's biometric information and they will be evaluated by the Consular Division before negotiation.
The new procedure will have certain benefits between which the following are calculated:
The total expenditure for visualization will be lower than the payment for the agreement, the second for the processing of the application and other for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant only makes the only payment that covers all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to 140 dollars for tourism visa, 150 dollars in cases of view of request (including view for temporary work) and 390 dollars for visa for businessers and investors.
People who want to restore their vision have to resolve a conversation with the consular officer, but they will only return to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and will be rejected by the printing of their fingers.
Since bioometric information will be removed in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the discussion on the Consular Division, there will be a shorter time than in the past.
Similarly, those who will ask for visa on consulars in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo are already paying additional payments for the service of $26.
For further information on the new procedure when requesting visa, please visit the following website http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of an alien life
The American Cosmic Agency invited the pressure tomorrow to present an outcome that could cause an injury in seeking foreign life.
The National Aviation and University Authority (NASA) of the United States will notify tomorrow, on Thursday, astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow in 13 hours of astrobiology experts, Âda, which is involved in the study of pâ, evolution, width and future of life in the universe, in the NASA seat in Washington.
When she invited the journalist, NASA assured that she would represent "revelation that causes a disaster in seeking foreign life", which raised the speculation of experts from other countries.
Revelation may confirm the theory that there are other creatures, living in unhosting subjects that were considered inhabitable, and who could imagine the possibility of one of them to become intelligent creators, such as people, if better subminans in which they live.
According to the opinion, there is a microb found on the depth of the sea of Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in Âa, which was considered too eating for any form of life, since the lake is rich to the arse.
The creation of arsen uses in a way of life, and it just increases the probability that a similar life could exist on other planets that have no atmosphere on earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use it in their metabolism arzen, it will be proved that " there is another, the second form of life, different from what we know."
The Cosmic Agency will announce the events of the events on the printing of the morning.
Conference with the attending geobiolog Pamela Conradva, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; the biologist Steven Benner, one of the doctors who examine Titan (the greatest month of Saturna) with a view that his chemical load is similar to that on earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron plant opposition block
The reforms of the Constitutional Law on the Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism".
The 60th parliamentary period has not yet been started when the opposite block was raised in Congress, the leader of the PRD party (Partido de la Revolution Democracy, Czechish "Strana Democratic Revolution" - after., PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Strana Work" - after., Convergencia (Checkie "Shoda" after.) and Jesus Manuel Montalvem, who was declared independent, and these four discussed about one thing: the entrance of "bipartism" to Sněm.
Before the beginning of the 60th parliamentary meeting, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corver Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo "harmonised" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it enforces them.
This reform, repeatedly, starts "bapartism", because it will now be two people from the same number of sides who will control the Congress.
These four lawyers, together with Gloria Margarito Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Council, held by Salvador López Britem from the PAN (Partido Action, Czech "National Action Party" - afternoon) and Luis Cardenas Fonsecou in Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo noted that these reforms are institutionally constituting political marginality from the Population of PRI (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech "Revolutional Institution Party") and PAN.
He noted that during the following days they will talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the schemes based on political will, and if they do not, they will be detailed again to these two parties with the end of the opposition coal.
"When I came here, I'm looking at it, because we're exhausted from any decision, they don't even want to consider the opinion of the ends."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez from Convergencia noted that PRD, PT and Patron agreed, and therefore they will create a plurality group.
It can't be allowed, he continued to Congress after what was monopolal now was "double".
Aspiration reform of the law is not to be an unnecessary bipartism in Congress.
This group begins with five legislators and its members now discuss with other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress was currently "profit" two - in the race of PAN and PRI sides.
"Earlier she controlled her only one side, two are divided today."
Patron Montalvo requested to respect the personality of the lawyer to be given to him at the acting table.
"To make us together five jobs that are probably no longer nine, but now they see us at five, we haven't left for cloud agreements, each in another group, and we have found the place at the action table, because the problem is that in the reform that they created and agreed, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
More 200 thousand weights are issued for the supplier.
The Officer in Mazatlán will pay another check of the debated owner of the company that provides electrical machinery.
Another shock on something more than 200 thousand weights was sent by the council by Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This amount shall be paid in this second half of the holder of the company which provides electrical material is exposed to 1.200,000 weights.
According to the transparency page of the Council, this last check was sent to 9258447 on November 16 of this year, it was set up to 200.144,56 weights and as its object was referred to as "balance of unreplaced payments".
Poster Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the companion would pay this supplier, followed by the High State Revision Authority for sale for high prices, another interest.
What wasn't said, the total interest that the council is still debt, and the number of shocks still will be sent in the benefits of Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, it only applies what we have to eat, as the final suppliers," he said in one conversation.
The final checks were "reacted" in the last fourth year: 24 September, 2 October 15, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this undertaking was not yet published in the Governing Journal, how the Law in the case of fires checked by the Supreme State Revision Authority to prevent their services from using other administrative authorities, the poster assures that the supplier of the Board has not reuse the services.
In the previous period, after July 25, the journal of Noroeste published the check review of the shocks issued to its suppliers, which discovered that in the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of age of Jorge Abel Lópeze Sancheze, the city of Camach Palazuelos paid over 10 million weights for 42 checks.
It also performed transactions with Jumapam, where she incased shocks for more than 3 million weights.
Tourists need to maintain
Tourist managers are in relation to the accident of an accident of the tourist due to the bad state of the Sanchez Taboady visit in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of the tourist to the propulsion at Sanchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlán of the Authority requests to give attention to the places and places that are in the wrong condition and do not show such a presentation in the good light.
Salvador Barraz Rubio, President of the Trade Association of Trade Zone Dorada, noted that they repeatedly requested to take care of the destination, and that is bad what the tourists think here to be replaced by new activities or travels.
He concluded that the wrong state of the streets and stakeholders affects tourists who are running here and see disasters, which unprecedently affect nearby enterprises.
"The police don't know how to close this business for one day, and they have no idea of the markets they're avoiding, Otherwise these matters would not resolve such a way and without a proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused the lack of preventive measures and maintenance from the Council.
"The Council will have to take responsibility and avoid repeatedly repeatedly, it will have to prevent the maintenance, not only to perform existing commitments," he said.
They wanted to enjoy a clean city because not only because we are tourists, we should be maintained, even as we are inhabitants to serve a clean dwelling, the adviser should change our town maintenance strategy."
There are also other places that look unexpectedly and poverty, noticed, for example, the Mazatlan Emblém and El Venadito (monument, socha jelene - pon.)
"In today's time to take tourists, not only to propagate, it is necessary to offer a good product, so the city that is cleaning its plagues and streets, where the continuous maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There is not the needed attention here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to all, the maintenance is missing.
He spoke about a number of places that should be correct in collaboration with the adviser, said that the priority must be maintaining the city clean and all right to be attractive because he has a tourist potential.
Raul Ller Martínez, a subsequent Tourist promotion, stated that the salvation of tourist sites in Mazatlán is inadequate because they are not correctly used and do not do good ideas.
Congratulations, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, but it will be necessary first to make it good, and these places have entered and could introduce them into the list we have to promote this destination."
IP requests the Congress Exploration
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to take a great responsibility by seeking a better Sinaloy, in various challenges that the members of the Member State.
The parliamentary period of lasting work and without agreement between the parties and the State Executive requires a business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is dismissed in the Churchs and in the major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, covered with seven political forces, 19 Primes, 13 of the PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and the last of the PVEM, which includes in total 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of the Congress is to be able to carry out public guidelines, the commitments to the company and the different conditions required by the responsible legislative work and that they are able to repeat the same pages and parental patterns.
Eduardo Davalos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Board of Employment (CCE), in order to take a great responsibility for the recent 40 recently selected meetings of the Congress, and it was an example of the road for the better Sinaloa at the various challenges that they face.
"We expect Members to exercise their right, without agreement between parties, because they are usually making measures to promote their own interests, and they continue to carnaval rulers and leaders of Parliament's groups."
Therefore, he said that the commitment should be confirmed to establish the needed decline that would move the Governing Body forward in accordance with the order.
"We want them to take a great job and be binding for companies and sectors because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloy who gave them their voice in the past options of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Hotel Association of Tres Islas, said that one of the greatest challenges for 40 national representatives will gather all forces in order to achieve the economic growth of the country because the current economic ability is very difficult.
The most important is to promote economic growth in order to create investment and infrastructure invitations, which will support the growth of workplaces in a certain way."
It is about the way of movement, he requested that new legislators give him more weight in the State budget and support the Ministry of Turism.
"I have learned that this is the Ministerial Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is inappropriate in view of the significant economic activity, the contribution of currencies and investments that will also directly cohere with agriculture."
Furthermore, the Congress should help add the State to security and assist with the alcohol law that has not been able to resolve in the previous parliamentary areas.
Three Kings are looking for
Children, cars and cars are together with other players on the list of children's desires in the family of Coronad Valenzuel.
For their parents, it will be difficult to fulfill their ideas as their household is reading exactly 12 people and one barana.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not work to make them Kašpar, Melichar and Balthazar games and clothes.
The family lives in a humiliated village in Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions because father has no longer work.
"We sometimes have it hard because the husband doesn't have happiness, but we sell mandarinks and brambers... I'm going out on the afternoon with "playback" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetan Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the child.
Four-year Adelaida wants a girl or a round, while her three-year sister Isabel would like Miss Barbie.
It's about the decades of José Alfred, he wants the same time "monster" car, and for his eight monthly brother Jesuse, Cayetan would like a clothes in size for a year.
"He told me (Josee Alfredo) "I would like this monster car," but I told him 'We're seeing a son, 'for he was very dear,' he's reaping Cayetan'.
For elderly children who were just at school, it would be ideal clothes and bottles.
Maria Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size of 12 decades of Isaiah size 10, where the eighth - year - old Miguel is weakening 8.
Joshua's fourteenth year missed tennis, so he'd have a couple of sizes of five and a half or six.
If you want to help meet children's dreams from the family of Coronad Valenzuel, you can participate in the "They search for three Kings" campaign, and on the receipt of the Noroeste journal to offer gifts or money in preparation.
14 significant drug businessers arrested
Tens of observations were carried out in Estonia, in the middle of the elimination of the network on the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen persons were arrested and sent to different accusations.
Overviews passed in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that served for drug production.
"And about 750 pounds of Indian conopy, four pounds of hash, money and equipment that served for production was fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaking police in Quebec.
On the whole, eleven men and three women were arrested, both the heads of the whole network, two men of Sherbrook.
The prisoners had to get to the Justice Palace in Sherbrook after their arrest.
They could commit an accusation from the production of an Indian conopy, his dress with the purpose of negotiating with him, striking and crying, inter alia.
These reviews were followed after the investigation that was last year.
"The information we received from the public and allowed us to access these prisons," Mr. Ruel said.
This police operation was held to the 70 regional police officers of the town of Estria, the State Police Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Management of Sherbrook Memomagog.
It's gonna be able to continue without problems.
In view of the law of conservators who, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships imposed by illegal promotors , it will be evidently possible while all three opposition parties in the middle have notified that they cannot support it.
"I'll be aware of Chart."
"I am directly on the side of the side that built a bullet under your feet," declared the boss of the liberals Michael Ignatieff, circumcised members after the weekly meeting of the week du cacus.
The Liberal Market is that we are a legal law, as it is proposed, which would enable any person who enters from a ship, identified as a ship transporting illegal asset, to violate the Canadian Chart of Rights and Freedom.
The Chef of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he can't support us with the law because he's going to the wrong goal.
"We're against and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we'll see what the government will do," Mr. Duceppe said.
The NPD critical in the question concerning the problem of promotion, Olivia Chow, refused the critics that want her side to be not sufficiently strong in relation to illegal promotors.
"Neo-democratics agree with this and have adopted measures against the overseers of illegal adjudicators, and this is what we consider as a narrow part of the other law, C-35," Mrs. Chow said.
"We don't support the law of conservators, because it covers the wine on the wine and puts the child's income for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
The Minister for Immigration Jason Kenney has committed opposition parties.
"The Canadians don't make this sort of illegal appeal, these criminal operations that Canada takes on a man and acts with her as a patrol."
Waiting for Canada to take further measures, Minister Kenney responded.
The Government did not declare the vote of confidence in its law, which could lead to the electoral elections to reject it.
One conservative said, at the same time, to the QMI Agency, that the Government would ask for vote to answer every one who is opposed to his position before his elector.
New unit does not mean uniqueness
Despite the notice , the possibility of creating a continuous unit for the fight against corruption and colussion, many observers continue to require the creation of a public research committee for the problem.
The Ministry for Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying to not forget this idea: Quebec agreed with the Department of Investigation from New York to carry out this problem already in January the next year.
Metropole has been available for a stage anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why no one of us was surprised.
It is necessary to note that, at the meeting of the Continuing Council for Police Services in Quebec, on 29 October the past year, this action was not undertaken even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, the public security criticism, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, was not required to evaluate this notice as a "country out of the clouke" and "materious solutions on the colline".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those fearing that political power has too large influence on my future of the unit.
"He'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We're aware of this problem."
For the President CSQ, Rejeana Parenta, nothing can replace the vote of witnesses in public conversion.
"In addition, Mr Charest states that he does not want to create this research committee, and people think, as you and I, something hides," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of the investigation committee is the demise Jeana Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, ethnic and political professor in the Institute for the Education of High State officials.
To be my -- to get out of this blind box, he proposed Quebec to make special powers to the general inspector to be able to investigate colussion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general inspector," he decided.
He also has the possibility that Quebec could give the inspector the same power as the Commissioner who allows people to be witnesses.
The creation of a continuous work of the group is not the only way in the Charesto Government's writings.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Treasury Law so that it would be better affected for this type of criminal activity.
This request would be issued from the author for Marteau (Cladivo), which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the jurisdiction in this type of investigation was not explicit.
The Federal Ministry for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is rightly concerned with some amendments associated with this writing.
At Jaro 2001, which was arrested by a group of motorists, although the Treasury Law has not yet been adjusted, 131 were arrested.
Ottawa followed the changes in the Gangstership Law.

Dupont partially blamed
The Quebec voting moderate Stéphane Dupont suffered a long disaster before the Canadian Council for the standards of vote and television (RRTV) due to the controversial expressions relating to social assistance and Haitíans, as well as for a cruel expression during the sending.
The Board for voting and television sends judges that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM should have the right to express their opinions, but some statements included "incomplete information on social assistance and an inappropriate negative explanation of Haitian's grave expression that does not correspond to the sending of the sentence during the day".
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including the sending of both persons who took their life, did not violate the rules for voting.
The Board for voting and television transmission received a number of comments made during the transmission sent between 2008 and 2010.
The decision was made after the complaint of the Common Fountain for Social Aid to Quebec.
The group claimed that the amounts listed in the transmission were unexpected.
The manufacturers must provide adequate information, not aware.
As regards self-mortality, the modernist Stéphane Dupont believed that self-mord was a gender of disfellowship.
Most of the Commission members have concluded that the transmission of a report was that self-mord cannot be challenged as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission believe that the constant episodes of sending "Dupont Sweet Reports" have been delicately insufficiently and appropriate."
No expenditure has been brought to him.
The last past was related to the declaration followed after landscape in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were assigned to the median interrupttors that had made many reactions.
The CHOI reported that he did not send any gift to the Haitians because we cannot certainly believe that the needs of money will be obtained.
The Commission believes that these comments were not authorised, but that their cumulatives constitute an indirectly negative image of Haitian.
"I've already opened my class-day range of that thing."
"My writer is incorrupted for one and a half of the year," said the modernist.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use to send a cruel expression.
Each voting CHOI-FM has cooperated "awarded its obligations".
For a station that will have to notify this decision once during the main transmission within three days, the results are minimized.

450 million without public concurrence
Hydro-Quebec agreed after a mutual agreement of 450 million with engineering companies on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this lavine, more than 100 contracts, it is just a consortium created by the BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which has gained the most important contract, contract for the management of the whole project at a total of $295 million without public concurrence.
This consortium, named Energy Gerance, was completely completed in 2004 with the choice of Hydro-Quebec to assesse its responsibility in the private sector for the management of this important hydroelectrical project in value of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energy Gerance" obtained a lucrati contract without any declaration of public concurrence.
For the Quebeck side, the complaint to the consortium of business is a serious ethical problem before us, which risks the distortion of competition and calls on increased prices.
"It's a new way to carry out colussions and dismiss competition."
"This means that people, who do no more secret agreements, do it openly today," said Mr. PQ Sylvain Simard last night on printing.
About something before, of course, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Contribution, because he says that it is hard to bring out how public interest can be sold so.
The Ministry for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, on the afternoon, insisting that it would go to this Colesion Treaty.
"I have my own way," she crossed and claimed that PQ was "incorruptible" and "forwarded accuracy."
She said that it would be the smallest that PQ would apologize.
The recept for the creation of consortium is a running practice worldwide.
It is an aliance limited at the time that allows two or several companies to buy their interim expertise to respond to the challenge of giving offers to a complex project.
The Eastman project is very compatible with the scope of work.
The stage is already running and must be distributed until 2012.
However, it was recognised with the same without competition; it was business.
It is also necessary to recognize that the consortial formula is no longer a exception in Quebec, not even in relatively simple projects.
As he discovered last week of Le Devoir, the engineering consortial formula is the subject of investigation in the government.
If we fly in the business register of chebec fires, we can discover more than 200 consorts, some seem to be created.
Such company Dessau works in partnership with its main competitors; we call CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens, leads to one and even a legal person, and it's Dessau.
It's about Energy gerance, Minister Normandeau's support, especially the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical special dynamic of work forces and that Hydro-Quebec reacts to her since the 70s".
The Eastmain project patron, Real Laporte, from the Energy Company of Baie James (SEBJ), made an explanation that will bring us to the extent that the project management has been closed after an interim agreement.
"If you go to the public competition and if there are few competitors to give a offer, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two options for the choice: that you get people who figure in that prohibition as competitors, and you say, "Let us close the agreement with a satisfying and good price."
"But the main idea is that it is not important to the price, but to the competence of people," Mr Laporte confirmed.
This department granted to the Energy Gerance consort is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000, which received the Quebec Party.
The contracts were closed with Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the Le Devoir verification, he calculated 109 engineering contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their residents, and, in particular, with laborators, performing the ground pattern analysis.
SNC-Lavalin saved 22 contracts, from which Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without shared in "Energy Gerance".
All contracts were closed.
Dohromades read 449 783 344 dollars, initially contracted with Energy Gerance company for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard noted that four companies who are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "very well known by the Liberal Page of Quebek".
Minister Normandeau sent the report that PQ is also connected to companies that "financ it" before she claimed that it was more about her management work.
Barometer responsible interruptions - "green" label doesn't excite trust
More green, but openly skeptic.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the sustainable development operators, but also on the "unsidely" marks and ecological certificates, in order to be guided by the selection of products.
It is the worst thing that, although we buy ourselves in the Media Universe, which is involved in us and brings us to the Community's most responsibility for consumption, this median universe calls over the lack of information, the unfaithfulness of the obligations that even holds it as a race for its commitment, the Barometer shall introduce the responsibilities of the first article, which the first article went out last night.
Although in 2010 the need is so commonly called responsible products, the people of Quebec who try to sell them, they do not believe them too much.
Two thirds of us are saying that they don't believe the promises of the fire of life, just because the green public of the company, finds a measured tool that observer has developed the responsible attitudes of the University in Sherbrooke.
Other discovery: half of the consumers doubts the ability of official certificates accompanied by the so-called corrective products, but also of the proportionality of products and labels that are labelled as a environmental responsible, states Barometre.
In the same way, the policy debate on this subject is adopted as a series of only 14,6% of Quebec people.
However, the information on the responsible interruption appears to be a priority for the stimulation of this page of the survival currently at least a third of the chemical consumers.
In fact, the vacuum and the doubtful nature of information would reduce over 46% of the consumers.
It's the second floor that Barometer identified, at the higher price of these products.
Lastly, the third inhabitant Quebekuse is not confidential to the data indicated about the production or the "green" services we are looking for, and they have allowed them to pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, half of the consumers was willing to change their speech and, in particular, to change the label of one or certain products that would respond to their convictions.
The total 61 per cent of them had pre-contributed the purchases of the businessers from their quarter and gave the priority for the purchase of food in their region, states Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - index responsible experience has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Quebeku is present as King of Recycling, which tries to the least impact on the lives by dealing with the protection of animals.
But their community and environmental consciousness obviously remained somewhere outside their car, states Barometer: In 2010, only 28% of Quebec's people have noticed that they use a hot transport or that they recommend the use of a car to drive at least two persons, in the interest of the protection of nature.
The behaviour and round also supported 39.1% of those of this broad advanced behaviour, which used this crash.
State payment for eXcentris complicated kin
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested to buy eXcentris Communication and Parallelle, agrees to participate, but only up to the money.
The Persian company Angus et le Parallèle, who endeavored to give up seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy a cinematographic complex in the Saint-Laurent bulletin and showed its sending as a lovers of film art, did not accept what she requested.
The government accepts that it will be included in the documentation but for its own submissions.
More than the expected gift of the Government of Quebec, which would finally be lower, was a longer expectation, which could establish a basis for life-based solutions for valuable submines and resources of the country.
The action plan and request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebeke, but the requests were already rejected for reduction.
Our activities plan and plan sent to the Ministry of the Community for the Development of Affairs in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, which is conducting a cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government's anti-government came to the SODEC company in a disaster.
Le Parallèle et日us has time to 31st in order to answer.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the State must be truly rejected.
Remember that the Chinese and cinematographic centers association in Quebec was contrary to the direct investment of the State to be able to support the eXcentris purchase, thinking that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance a project relating to the possibility if he did not do this for other cines.
However, a few of the debates were still required of fundamental economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his camera for ten years of film art after he financed the building of a complex, which could be a challenge to change from the financial Council of the State.
The lack of sales for independent films is crying in Montréal, and eXcentris could get a permanent clientel.
Society et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, leads a campaign to release financial billions into the private sector, in the faith that it will win $700 000 for the transmission of accision.
Since July 2009, one of the three film companies, Le Parallelle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The purpose of the future purchasers is to reopen all three sales on 27 February next year and to prevent the most beautiful movie Xaviera Beauvois Man and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devoir, and so he ignores, he thinks with his group of proposals for reduction that are made to him.
Highlighted opon on Canada as a whole...
The new American diplomatic flames, known by WikiLeaks, discover what the United States consider as a complex minority of Canadians against the Americans, but thus express their feeling of surrounding the last named Canadian.
The American diplomates, therefore, wonder that every Canadian elector is on the heart of Canadian-American relations when he is going to choose, and that the visit of President Obama has helped to keep the Government in order to accept its budget in 2009!
Four new messages between which the American ambassador was in Ottawa and Washington, issued last night on the public service, provide more sensitive details to get "under the skin".
The communication with dated 22 September 2008, namely the electoral campaign, detailedly states in which point the United States are not part of the commitment of political leaders.
To the great wonder of the American Highlight in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides a few explanations to this.
"Canada's complex of minority, too strong, refers to possible political leaders to talking about internal injuries, rather than to realize that these options are related to the United States (as in the campaign on free trade in 1988). "
"Associated States are therefore," he concluded, "in these options, "all right, but potentially too dangerous than to talk about them."
Velvyslanic understands this "speaking silence" less than that both countries maintain the intensity of political and economic relations.
"It's logical that the ability of the candidate, the parties or even better the head of the party to conduct these important relationships should be the key factor that has the electors to think when they go to the elections."
Other exhibitions of this feeling of importance can be read in the report that Terry Breese sent on 22 January 2009, charge d'affaires in Ottawa in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obamu for its first visit to Ottawy.
"Your road will help to maintain the Government in voting on trust in the beginning of February, regarding the federal budget which Canada publicly recognises its first deficit for more than ten years, for the plan of renewal of 30 to 40 billion dollars," says Mr Breese.
There is no doubt that the Government had to separate the Parliament's pre-natural meeting so that the coalition could be violated and that the opposition parties would remind their survivals of the quality of the proposed plan of renewal.
Another news of January 2008 and signed by Wilkins, advises Washington to what more negative images are sent to the United States to the dramatic series sent to the CBC.
Velvyslanic is concerned by sending Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too famous links can be observed to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also on income for violent hearings at .
Another report refers to the fact that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe is ready to adopt some of the Guantánams.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the principle of the case.
At the end of the meeting, it is written here, "the translated paper about Omara Khadr, the 15-year Muslim of the Canadian Power, the State Secret."
"The secrets accepted that it's rejecting the folder."
Let's finally recognize that the people whose WikiLeaks are going to go.
Tom Flanagan, an ex adviser very close to Stephen Harper, announced on the wallets of the CBC that the person responsible for this mass should be "devastated".
It was reported and heard of Mike Huckbee in the United States.
World Plan for the Resume of Light
The United Nations was a plan to restore home lighting, lighting of trade and industrial space in 100 countries in Cancún with a view to reaching the limitation of the glass effect (GES), which is at least one third of the further restrictions that must be targeted for the stability of the climate of the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitional plan is located in the stage of large specific projects that the United Nations want to carry out in Cancún to compensate the absency of difficult implementing commitments to reducing industrially developed countries.
According to the proposed plan yesterday, if the soldiers that monopolize still 50 to 70% of the market are replaced by fluocompact or, even better, electromanic diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the primary quantity of 1,8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the GESC on the planet that is raised for lighting would be rejected.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world.
It's a 70% equivalent from the car park on the whole planet.
In Codiane, in the Latvian Year, large countries with a significant share of views such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, have participated in voluntary plans for reduction that should be enabled to reduce global GES from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to remove from this balance 5 Gt to achieve the stability of climate heating until 2020 to 2 degrees of Celsia, so that it may be myself to claim that it will not be left out of control.
95% of energy is spread in the form of warmth and residue, namely 5%, is the light product.
With fluocompakt bulbs, energy need is reduced by 75% and with the new wallets with Del, we reduce this need two times again.
The fluocompakt boxes shall be maintained in the average of 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new ships with Del,takes that introduced this week to Philips - this company was particularly approached to the United Nations study - , having a predicted life of 25,000 hours and have 80% less energy than a disturbed bullet, which gives us an imagination of the possibility of support with the refund plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new garments can also work with reostates and explode less warm.
And they don't contain any addiction.
A number of experts have made the refunds against fluocompakt garments because they contain the breast, and it is necessary to classify them as a dangerous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, if the manufacturers would build collections.
Of course, as reports, the main source of growth on the planet is not a fluocompakt garbage, but more heavy corners, which allow a lot of plants necessary for the production of electricity splitted in fired cows.
Only in the United States, these centers give up to 25,000 tonnes each year.
The report also detailedly states the benefits of each country from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would protect a billion dollars annually for electricity purchasing and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3,5 warm electricity which would be 2.5 billion
The slonovine waves are not patiently expecting the results of electoral results.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Poland after the expiry of the specified periods.
"The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent election committee to complete his work and immediately inform the preliminary outcome, the chairman of the United Nations."
"He requests all parties in the Power of Slovenia and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to maintain any initiative until the report of provisional investigations."
Despite the pressures developed by some intergovernmental governments, the electoral committee allowed the latest date - the midnight - without publishing the results, three days after the weekly breakdown.
About 40 minutes ago, the President CEI in television confirmed that the Commission was "continuing working" in order to report the results.
In the middle of the world, the challenges were multiplied to finally announce the name of the second road, between Laurant Gbagbo and the member of the opposition of Alassan Ouattar.
However, the Gbagbo camp agrees to cancel the Constitutional Council for "subwater" voting northly managed by the former resurrected New Army (FN) from an insufficient state return in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in the Poland of Slovenia, confirmed that the fear of the walkers who practiced the FN (New Army) in the north of the country had decreased the president Powers of Slovenia from going to vote.
The options could be canceled if the Constitutional Board looked at the same by Gbagbo.
Of course, the President Gbagbo's opposite is that the highest court of the country is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political associate of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from north, who dements any connection with the former resurrected, judged the detention in the announcement of the results as "inadmissible" and requested Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far that he would win.
His associates confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered loss and that to give a complaint to the Constitutional Council after he protected the electoral Commission to submit outcome would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections held on Sunday was considered a co-ordination of the process of reconciliation and measurement of the country, which has already been divided into two half years.
The United Nations warned in the middle of the Political Fraction of Powers of Slovenia that it could be made responsible for eventual violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, on 31 October, as a winning of 38% voices exceeded 32% for Alassan Ouattar, which obtained public support by former President Henri Konan Bedié (25% in the first round).
The measure of unemployment remains stabil in the third quarter of France.
The measure of unemployment in France in the meaning of the International Working Authority (BIT) remained stabil to 9.3% in the metropolitical France (9.7% in the sea-sea), as the provisional data shown with the correction of the sessional declines (CVS), published by INSEE on Thursday.
The beginning of unemployed was 2,631 million in metropolis.
The data from the second quarter were confirmed by 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% of the seas.
For one year, the non-employment measure shall be increased by 0.1 point.
In a wide range, 3,4 million people in the metropolitical France are not working in the third quarter, but they would like to work, unless they are available for two weeks to work, and unless they are looking for or not.
The situation of current young people on the work market was still increased by a new increase in unemployment at 24.2% in the metropolitical France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25% in general maritime areas.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people from 15 to 24.
It is about elders, those mentioned in the metropolitical France a small increase in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitical France (+0.2 points in three months, the same as in the year), that is 482.000 people from 50 years old and 6.6% in general maritime areas.
Only the population in 25-49 years had benefited from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitical France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishs the monthly non-employment rates since 2006, and it is after a half of its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to work monthly and reported at a deterioration the pace of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and invoked
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of the business for the processing of waste and PS PS Administrative Bouches-du-Rhone Bouches, was accused and arrested in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the case of investigation in the matters of public prohibitions, seemed underly obtained.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of the disuse of the company's property, public funds and public property, secretization, payment, acceptance of taxes for the effect of the authority and shooting, introduces his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting, and it takes it to explain to the judge all the questions that he wants to put on, and no overwhelming."
"It is easy to follow her for many trial events, but another thing is to prove it," she declared for AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before her client's vote.
Mr Guérini has introduced his lawyers' responsibility that he has sent judges before his hearing a short notification to explain everything.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and arrested in the middle of the evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucie Simon, his client never did anything else than he had to ensure the operation of the box that he had to manage.
This is about the allocation of a prohibition or the destination of funds associated with their functioning, never knowing anything like that, Mr Simon said.
In this regard, Daniel Pinn, the former General Director of the Services of Aubagne, was accused in the middle of the injury of public chairs and comploit, and left free, under the legal supervision of the prohibition of contacting, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to explain to all that he had been exhausted."
"The investigative judge watches and leaves it in freedom," he introduced his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Other four persons were accused and released for freedom in the night from the attack to the middle, with a judicial supervision for two of them, introduced the representative of the State government of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, representative of the Director-General with the Elegancy of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is charged for accepting taxes for the impact of the office and for the passion of corruption."
Two aglomerations of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briinguier, are accused, one for the "decision and disuse of the company's property", the second for "complot in the disuse of public chairs".
Finally, the trade partner Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "histing the deficit of the company's ownership."
Among those who were confronted with Mr. Guérinim, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard was recently accused of subwater public prohibitions relating to Korsika.
Researchers understood his company that they helped to pay money from a total gangstership.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several open-of-the-X court investigations in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters relating to the opinions of public prohibitions, in particular in the case of waste.
From the source of close investigation, the monitoring is focused, in particular, on the submination of the allocation and functioning of the ship in La Ciotat, which reduces waste from Aubagne, as from some cities from the town of Marseille (MPM).
The case of Clotilde Reiss: Elysian palace overcome the Syria media
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotildy Reiss, a young research officer arrested in Iran for "spinagi", united opinions in France, introduced diplomacy to warfare and highlighted the relationships between Paris and Teheran.
All of this has been closely followed by diplomats from the United States.
American documents receipt by WikiLeaks and council with Le Monde discover some of the challenges of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained his strategy to the Americans, while it went so far that he advised them how to control such cases by handmaid in Iran (small group of elders).
They show how the French representatives were trying to convince Washington that the release of young French was not a compensation against the release of freedom of the freedom of Kakavanda, the Iranian in France and the investigated American justification for subsequent trade with material in the benefits of the Iraq nuclear programme.
Finally, they develop a warm light way that the French presidency tried to manipulate media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the release of Klotildy Reiss.
He didn't do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram signed on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title: "Iran:Francouz comments for a solution in the case of hands."
Advisor from the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richer, delivered by the Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Central East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of the American diplomatic Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They recommend the Americans to do so much to be brought back to their own state members by violence held in Iran.
"Take a sound," they say, "continue expressing "in the middle words "based human rights", "invinity", "indirect release".
It must be introduced into the hatred of Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it more than what more they will ask you to stop."
Because the trials of negotiation through discrete channels have been carried out, "it's quiet to resolve nothing," Ireland's "misters of avoiding manewries".
Mr. Richier believes that the involvement of foreigners is "Iranian family tactic: the breach of hands for the "political exhibition".
It notes that the freedom of Klotildy Reissov (which will come on 16 August, on the day when the French ambassador is approved) "demands to pay high financial amounts to Iraqs" (cause 230 000 euros).
And he announces that the Elysian Palace anticipates the cases of hands, the phenomenon that "will go out."
The Iranians could "in the future capture other 1800 French living in Iran," says.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left the service for 12 days ago, but she remains locked in Iran.
The information is extended: Iranecide Kakavand, of which the United States declare that it was released for illegal trade with electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on freedom based on the decision of the judge.
The American welfare as many observers are asked for this concerning meeting.
For Washington, who tracks the illegal Iranian network to obtain the nuclearly designed material, is the spread of Khakavanda is a bad news.
Frankie's joined a talk?
Freedom of Iranian for the freedom of young French?
In the next conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richer assures that it is not.
The Elysian Palace, as it states, was not only "excused by this decision of the judge", but sought the opportunity to stand against it.
"The discussions have been conducted between the President and the Minister of Justice" (in that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "The French government cannot change the decision of the court," comments.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French reporting service.
The Elysian Palace adviser extends the phone number, closes the phone audience and then informs the American diplomatic that Iraq is currently in Paris's buildings managed by Iran's welfare."
At the time of Klotildy Reiss in Iran, the Elysian Palace develops efforts, negotiates, by means of communications and organised "unicians" in the media to convince that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays "essential" and "effective" role of "mediterrane".
The Americans notice this activity without ironic and observe that the manipulation brings its fruits, since several articles in print reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evolve the median "blest" of French official factors.
On what such "gratitude", expressed against Mr. Assad, is questioned by the excellence in Paris.
"Instead of their declaration, the French official factors in private recognize that they have only a weighty idea of what the Syrians have done."
The document is then involved in the d·y's proposed by the Elysian Palace to pay in this fixe.
Intensity’ Communication 's focus on the validation of the policy of President Sarkozy's opening with Syria',' it analyzes.
It was applied in 2008, "that was observed by many critical votes in France and in the chair and marked as a preliminary and unserviceful."
Thus, "as the overcome of the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria, which thanks can be served when it plays role in".
The goal is also to "seat an unfailing zero between Syria and Iraq".
The American ambassador knows it with a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier believed him, "We don't know whether the Syrians have done something, so that it's anything."
"But we thanked them."
"It should be at least introducing the insufficiency of the Iranian."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her in the Elysian palace.
In the communication, the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria thank for their "active role in the benefit of our country freedom".
End on-line her after north for young Korea
The South Korean Government will accept the law called "Pecivalski", which will prohibit youths to play online games after midnight, blocking access to them, introducing responsible government factors.
The law will be submitted to the Parliament in a position to ask for online games to block access to these games after the midnight to the younger persons of 16 years, introducing representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family Ministry.
"To many children play these games all night and then have problems with learning in school and are not able to lead normal life during the day."
"We have that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," he declared for AFP Jo Rin, the leader of the Ministry, which has the law of anxiety.
Online games will be new access from 6 hours.
Communities will have one year to prepare for the law.
The Government also assumes that it requires the company to restrict each day access to these games for young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible employer has completed.
It also provides available to people who ask for this, free programs that allow the time to be used on the Internet.
The South Korea is one of the most "supported" countries and the daily pressure regularly brings different facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
Earth is like an insufficient master in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medails on World Cyber Games, which faced the face of 58 other nations.
World Mistership in 2018-2022: Fifa establishs host country.
The full disturbance for corruption is established by the Executive Committee of Fifa on Thursday 2018 and 2022 of the World Warfare Country Country, the choice of politically motivated, where the fight against impact and lobbing risks that the technical criteria are achieved.
It is more sure that the Royal Competition of Fifa in 2018 will be in Europe , the traditional bathroom of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgia).
Mystery in 2022 will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes that it will obtain a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the president in the African continent in 2010, or continue to continue in the meeting in the United States or in the Next East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons that are involved in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince from Kataro, leaders of Governing Factors of the Republic of the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham,
Training in the consequences causes the risk that they will take up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to specify hierarchies according to candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, the documentation of English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and the American (2022) includes the best arguments, as the documentation of their competitors.
But these debts will have too large weight for 22 members of the Executive Commission in a hour for voting.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to suspending two members of the CE /European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Themeria et Amos Adam) may have destroyed the chances of its country, the graves, which later had a world champion only once in the year.
The BBC set it on Monday when it enhanced a document that "introduced" three members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayato.
How to influence Fifa's unfriendly and lead to the hatred of the Ethiopian leaders with David Cameron in the first range.
The President of the Government hopes that he will be able to repeat the one who was told his preacher in Tony Blair in 2005, which was able to obtain the Olympics Organization of Olympics in 2012 for London in 2005.
Will this intensity be sufficient to enable England to add a new leak to its name to the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less accurate because two Spanish-Portuguese have no longer missing tumps of prepared stations, its welfare (World Shampionate in 1982 in Spain, Olympy Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their cultural culture.
But dark economic and financial perspectives both countries could give these ambitious mildness.
The relevant advocate measures against the English and doubts on the payability of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was a foreigner and through the areas in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, the President of the Government Vladimir Poutin decided that the mistership would not move to Curich and publicly declare "no competition in the preparation of voting", in the words of the words, only appealed to the accusation of the English pressure against the members of the CE (European Commission).
"We'll be throwing them with a blue, try to compromise them," Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022, it seems to be a logical favorite of the United States with their significant experiences in 1994.
The highest economy in the world, the seat of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems that this country has a big speech before Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have prepared a beautiful project.
But these candidates seem to be temporari for both countries that have made a "test" together in 2002.
Next threat: Awarding the worldwide 2026 China mystery, which he horriblely wants Fifa, has affected Asian chances for 2022 inadequate.
With Katar, who went out of the hands of a big eas in the form of future stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in its expansion to the new country, but these two countries represent more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could take care of chatting TVs (with time movement) payable to European countries, creating a thief force for Fifa.
Second mandate: transparency (software)
De Gaulle was actually weakening.
Mitterrand's wake up the idea he was weakening.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not wear at least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than they.
The mandate to the Elysian palace calls someone else.
The current head of the State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously, it is not in a good manner with a share in the secret associated with the President.
Thus, there is a need to do as if doubts continue to survive.
In the same way and in the second sense.
In 2006, unless it wants to believe it, friends of Jacquese Chiraca made a claim that the third mandate would not be excluded.
On November 15, with a serious expression of Nicolas Sarkozy, he assured that "at times it will be decided on the basis of 2011".
As the UMP Parliament members in the middle of the evening in the Elysian Palace, the "two mandates" perspective has sent a little warm state.
Was it an official announcement of his candidate?
He wasn't far away.
The President only noted that the reform of the Institute in 2008 limited the number of five-year-old periods to two.
It was just a statement, not a notice.
It is not the first time it takes such a humor tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have yet seven and a half year with me," he passed in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "You don't think I'm not thinking about another stage."
His previous statements will not make it as candidate more than the last day; they will not do it as candidate or less.
If he calls a comment, it's due to two truths.
On the way to the candidate to the PS, on the one side.
But this isn't the entrance of Segolèna Royal, which presses Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
It is, however, because his candidate in 2012 is evident that many in PS want to organize the war-building buildings more preliminary than intended.
Bad investigation on the other side.
First, electors of rights would prefer the candidate from Françoise Fillon before Nicolas Sarkozy's candidate (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't investigate this thing with UMP," responded immediately and looked at people from the nearest part of the government's president.
"If there is a possibility of an offense, where to candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin states.
"He will still believe that he can win," Alain Juppé, equated by transparency.
Euro: The Central European Bank is required to continue in its purchases of State titles.
The latest meeting of the Central Council for the year should have been the opportunity to determine the submission for the implementation of the crisis or, at least, notice of the stop of a large number of unnecessary operations of the monetary policy which must be completed until the end of this year.
The crisis foreseened by European considerations is committed to the institution for the delivery of valuable papers, without doubt, can be allowed to be so category under the threat of threatening the deterioration of the European markets today as so stressed on the European markets with valuable papers.
The political price would in such a case be higher than it.
The French Ministry of Finance of Christine Lagarde gave the active role played by the Central European Bank in the resolution of the crisis of European States last night.
She didn't want to say if she thought that the bank could do more, for example by enhancing their purchase programme of obligations.
"I welcome my attention to my European partners..."
Last night, in Brussels, at its vote to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear as more explicit in relation to its purposes, and he agreed with the fact that the programme of purchase of state titles on the secondary market "is "continuing" and that "we will see how we will decide" during the meeting that is held on Thursday.
Only certainty: The Central European Bank will keep its basic unchanged rates of 1%, its historical lowest level since May 2009.
During the purchasing of obligations of the post-complianced Central European Bank, the last week were doubled to approximately 1,35 billion euros.
And thanks to the incompatibleness of income in the market, new purchases of Irish and Portuguese obligations yesterday.
The total central banks of the euro have buyed 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There are no doubts between the contracts on the market for purchase continuation (see page 29).
The economics do not expect any significant change in the course.
If money operations have been lost for more than three months from the European Central Bank's arsenal, this recently appointed bank is accessed to the unlimited delivery of liquids according to major subminans and for a period of duration from one week to three months.
The economic today expects that this mechanism will be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, this would mean to accept the risk of calling a short-treatment," says Michael Schubert, the Commerzbank economy.
"Progresss" the east reported during the first quarter of 2011 seems likely more likely, "Norbert Brooms, the economy at Sal.
Uppenheim.
At the plan of its intervention on the market with a public duty, "the European Central Bank should maintain the volume of the purchase of its obligations to survive a small market," adds Norbert Brums.
With regard to the exposure of the European banks on the markets, it has no other choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary for each price to replace the absence of investors on the market and to act in such a way to prevent the planning of the payable performances of the State, which belong to the most cross-border," a significant obligation manager confirmed yesterday.
Since if the rates are deployed, they will be more concerned in order to reduce their debt instead of stabilising it.
It's a saved euro for this price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi's background
After the beginning of a week for Italy, she was a little released, with a return to 10 years of obligatory rates.
Return to the temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Ministry of Economics of the Presidency of the regions, they said that they heard Giulia Tremonti, the "unresoluble" and expected "unpredictable" weekend, which then was involved in dementoval.
In any case, in derogation from the long German rates, the record of 210 basic points and the price of contracts against the risk of bankroth (CDS) has passed up to 263 points, which caused certain distortions in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi, the derogation with German rates was higher than 400 basic points in Spain.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, stated about himself that he was "too busy" "building market development" and my order by Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, the economy in Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and unexpected fiscal income, which is in hands and is a risk that it can cover its needs of financing.
The last announcements of Brussels were for the Government of a frozen puzzle.
The Italian growth has now been expected to 1,1% in 2011 and to 1,4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1,3% and 2%.
For these submissions, calculating the European Commission, the deficit of public funds will also represent 4.3% of the brutal home product in the next year (on 3.9% of the proposed government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From that point the new summary of additional additions to the State budget which could be introduced after holidays at 7 billion euros.
"When necessary, new urgent measures must be adopted," the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, O日 Rehn.
For this time, Italy accepts support for international institutions.
"The basic stones of her economy are all right and its calculations are correct, we repeat it already," assured Arrigo Sadun, the Italian Governing Board of International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short or sensitive, because through its significant duty (119.2% of the brutal household product in 2011, NDLR), it is the effort to stabilization requested in Italy less than the efforts required by the rest countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, the main OCDE economy.
The matter of political instability remains.
14. The Silvio Berlusconi will make a claim to express the uncertainty of the Missouri, and then they may be able to organize the options with which it is calculated at the end of March.
It would begin such a period, a little appropriate for decisions in the case of serious crisis.
Europeans think of strengthening anticrisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde repeated it last night in the printing Âe in Paris: "I think the Europeans have demonstrated it on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very soldier decisions, engaging to defend their currency and their monetary zone."
Although everything is relatively, yesterdayly mentioned expansion relating to the rates of European State obligations, it has brought water to small governments and Central Europeans.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's notice Authority noted that it could degradate the debt record of Portugal, the targets to which the most different speculations are focused.
"Because in May there is a real insufficient and clear policy, particularly on banking systems," states the Economy Exane BNP Paribas.
Moreover, "the political time runs less than the market time."
In knowledge of this disrupted relationship and danger that hides, Europe's countries intensify the debate that aims to strengthen existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal interactions between the Ministry of Finance, most affected by the problem, and, in larger way, with G20, they are very well developed.
In view of the Euroscope (Eurogroup) meetings and the Ecofin group from the beginning of the next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is being held today.
The programme shall be judged by nonconventional measures to support the euro country by the marketing (see above).
This is about the European Financial Fund (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, engaged in an attack in Singapore travel to Asia, with a view to informing investments from the East East on the development of crisis in Europe.
It is not the aim of this road to increase the funds, it is preparing the impact of the earth to achieve this goal.
The FESF value papers shall be prescribed for the next month.
The American Official Representative reported to the Agency Re日s yesterday that the United States will support the possibility of mobilised financial staff with additional direct engagement in the FMI.
The lands in the first range, Portugal and Spain, are prepared for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular on the organisation of the work market.
Reforms which are accompanied by a close measures to a sive.
Lisboa and Madrid otherwise than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid every price that they ask for international assistance before they apply their own budget correctives and to decide on structural reforms that are necessary to restore their trust.
The capitalists in the European Funds finally speak about the options for the process of normalization of markets with the binding obligations.
At its journey to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came with a idea whether 750 billion euros had been mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not wear to re-cover the resource of valuable papers.
Economys from Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the first trade plan with European searches, judge that the additive would have approximately 100 billion euros, as a form of direct financial liquidity.
The middle exists: it is the European financial stability mechanism, which is born for 60 billion euros.
The Council has all the chances to be tested in European major cities.
Especially when market submines were harmed.
Snow and Native: 24 countries have oranx facilities.
The Snow Awards will still be transported, especially in the streets of other classs in Britain, and there is a risk that some economic activities are distorted.
Twenty-four periods have from the current oranxie preparation for the risk of snow and effect.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, have been connected to 20 periods that have already been reported in the oranshood, 18 from the middle afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, after night.
According to Metéo France, significant snow privileges affect problems on the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and weaknesses on Ile-de-France.
The snow cover between 2 and 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected during the periods concerned and the cover from 1 to 3 cm, places to 5 in the Paris region.
The periods of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and periods of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snows are too large to cause transport moves and cancel some economic activities, predetermined by Metéo France.
At Côtes d'Armor, some periods have prohibited a hard cost transport - cost cars over 7,5 tonnes with Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brie-Loudéac.
The road operation on the streets of other classs in the United States is very difficult, and the police recommends to go out with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Pikardia, school connections were banned on Thursday.
In the middle of the evening, no special measures are presented to restrict cost transport.
The local office "invites all car drivers to the greatest care of the streets and to adapt the vehicle weight's weight.
The General Directorate-General for Civil Airport (DGAC) requested the aircraft companies to cancel 25% of their flights on the Paris Roissy Airport and 10% on Orly from the expected snow advances.
The DGAC recommends the travellers using air transport services to connect to its company.
In Great Britain, the Gatwick airport is closed to the quarter of the country in South London and the airport in Edinburgh in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: First Financial Affairs
Since the debate on the modernization of transport to Ile-de-France is in the full run, a billion.
At least during the debate.
We are especially 23 billion per metro Grand Paris to establish Societé du Grand Paris.
In order to allow this building to be launched, he notified the state of a deductation of EUR 4 billion.
It is clearly theoretical that allows SGP to use for prohibitions part of financing from its double resource.
We finally get to the first places today.
The 2010 Financial Revision Act, which examines the Financial Committee of the National Reserve Committee today, contains mechanisms to ensure these stocks.
There are two: creation of special taxes from equipment and increased taxes from the office at Ile-de-France.
Dr., let's read in the text of the law, Article 15, sounds "in the benefit of the public institution of Société du Grand Paris".
It's calculated, "The tax of this amount is 117 million euros per year."
The second is the restructuring of the taxes for offices already existing, therefore "to be modernized to increase the results from it and to increase this impact to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Overwhelming.
It's not digited in the text.
We've got 4 billion away.
"It is determined that these financial resources are connected to 4 billion euros from the investment that will be mobilised by State and entered into the Société du Grand Paris under the project," we can read in the explanation of debt.
This system doesn't seem shocking to us in the SGP company.
"From the time we created income (two taxes, ndlr), we can hide the study for three years and then go up to 4 billion, it's explained here."
"It will be included in the budget and used for needs."
The SGP community has 4 billion will be added to 2013 for the budget for 2014.
This mechanism, in which four promised billion are still inappropriate abonnants, risks that it calls sometimes a wide parliamentary debate.
The public meeting will be 7.
Smoking hackers and accompanying producers
The case of WikiLeaks has two significances.
On the one hand, an apparent scandal, a scandal that seems to be scandal is only faced in the face of the secretity that leads to relations between States, citizens and printing.
On the other hand, it refers to deep changes at international level, and takes the future of a controlled regression.
But let's do the order.
The aspect of WikiLeaks, this is the confirmation of the fact that each document consists of a secret service (whoever is the people) comes from printing sticks.
The Americans' immoral discovery about the way of Berlusconi's sexual life are noticed what everyone could read in any news (all other than these two Berlusconi own), and the Caricatural profile of Kadafi was already available for the cabarot artist for scratch.
The rule, according to which secret documents can be collected only from messages already known, is essential in the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the bookbuilding which is a ezoteric literature, you will see that each work is repeated (of Graal, Rennes-le-Château, Templates or Zendars) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And not only because the author of ocult texts doesn't like to follow new information (and he doesn't know where to look for messages about non-existent), but because those who face ocultism are only to what they already do and who confirms what they have learned before.
This is the mechanism of Dan Browna's success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informator is lined, and line (or anxious spirit) the head of secret services (and if not, it could be, as I know, a editor in the news of Libération), which constitutes the truth only what he admits.
The information on Berlusconim, which the American welfare sent to the state resort, was the same as Newsweek published a week ago.
Why, then, have so many visits been made around the discovery of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, and although the gloriousness, at least since the end of the Second World War and since the time when the heads of the States can phone or go to a flight at a common dinner, lost their diplomatic ability and, except some small practices in the representation, were transformed into the Spanish centre.
Anyone who follows research movies knows very well that it is just likely to ignore it.
However, that it is publicly repeated, anonymous obligation of covering and brings it a bad light on the American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most accurately stumbled information of the world's most powerful country represents a strong degree, even inconsistent, for the pressure of this state resort.
The scandal affects the victims, so his winner.
But let's go out of here to the deep truth about what happened.
Sometimes, in Orwell's days, I was to take all the power, like the Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
The Orvellovo prophecy has been shown since the time, which, thanks to the possibility of controlling every move through the phone, every transaction, visited hotel, using the distance and so further, has become a citizen of the full sacrifice of power.
But when we demonstrate how this goes now that even the "groups" with the most secret information of the powerful can't deal with the hacker's headquarters, it stops to be the control message directly and becomes a refugee.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - chosen as a civil master - can know all the secrets of power.
How can it be able to keep the power that has no longer a chance to keep his own secret?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is an absolute secret (and an absolute secret could never be discovered); it is also true that all information about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is a secret of an absolute secret, because it is extracted from the public life; but to discover, as WikiLeaks did, the secret of Hillary Clinton's was incomplete secrets, means to take him all power.
WikiLeaks did not make any mistake in Sarkozy or Merkel, but did something great to Clinton and Obam.
What will the results of this enjoyed power be so significant?
It is obvious that in the future States they will be able to send on-line sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on the plate on the round of the street.
But it is also obvious that it is unexpected that it is possible to keep a message on the phone.
It's nothing easier than checking if and when the head of the State was traveling to the aircraft and connected to some of his colleagues.
How will they be able to be maintained in the future in the promotion of private and sensitive messages?
I know that for this moment the prognose belongs to science-fiction, and then it's fantastic, but I have to imagine the government factors who are directly carrying out the formality on the incontrolable paths and bring only the messages to themselves that they know to remember or hide more rare information in the bottom.
The information will be stored in unique copies in keys closed: totally taken, trying to spinner in Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that now it's moved on the front side, that's the point.
One century later, when a free telegraph signed revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated the telegraph based on roads (telephones).
Video indicators (analogs) have enabled the lovers of the cine to film a step behind, to move it before and up and discover all the mysteries of the mount, while now CDs (numbers) only allow to scroll on the rocks, that means after the ships.
We'll come from Rome to Milán in three hours, while on the road and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional that policy and communication technology will return to the roads of the horse.
Last note.
Sometimes, the pressure tried to understand what happened in secret of the secrets of the prospectus.
Now they're the highlights that ask for confidential information from printing.
Climate: how France hacked its promises of financing
The year after the Codean Agreement is time to test the compliance of promises on Âe unlocked financing (financing with the start (fast start) or preliminary), which is carried out by developed countries.
And great French hairs were discovered.
In the Codean Agreement, developing countries have committed 30 billion dollars in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised 7,2 billion euros for three years and France 1,26 billion euros (this is 420 million per year).
At the start of the COP16 EU, it was very important to convince its partners of the reality of its obligation on the financing of fast start: a report to address the actions of their Member States, printing, large side event, distribution of the brochure...
Transparent operations are unvaluable and evaluated in their value: developing countries and citizens would like to make all developing countries and citizens the same and the same measure of accuracy.
The EU notifies that in 2010 it has released 2,2 billion euros, which brings it to the right path to fulfil its promise of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But if we move to detail, we find out that things are much more complicated.
These financial hedges are "new and added" according to the Code Agreement to ensure that the increased burden has been carried out without the public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no match in what it means "new and added."
While the European Commission has been harmonised, some Member States, among others and France, have blocked the process.
Today everyone chooses a reference that makes him the best.
For example, the European Commission considered a reference in 2009: the international financing has been maintained, and it is still added to 150 million for three years of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references to annual payment terms or terms at the level of public aid for development.
Instead, France has the fact that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and added".
Otherwise, there is no reference to the expenses of the previous period or to the global level of public assistance for development d'Aideque au development.
In particular, the total aid to France against developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decreased) must keep its commitment to the financing of new and additional...
Another decision-making element is the distribution of gifts and payments.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses its own way of calculation.
Some, such as France, believe that 1€ payable is equal to 1€.
It is evidently hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of the money can be added to certain investments that are rentable (frequently related to projects associated with reduction, counts in the more important areas), it is to present one euro that we get, as equivalent to one euro we give, not to understand from the title of their commitments but as a price for the credit country (e.g. the equivalent of the rates).
But France can only give such a derogation: "He keeps" his commitment in EUR 420 million, which makes 91.5% of the money (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of the gifts (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so that you can verify it.
It is the only Union country that uses a payment in such a way.
Germany requested 46% from here, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovenia (in other cases) holding their commitments with 100% of gifts.
Otherwise, when the simplicity of the European Union gives 1€ for the satisfaction of its promise, France gives only 10 centimeters and considers this effort comparable.
It's a beautiful cheeklyr cow!
For its finance, France operates with two leaders: on the one hand with the development of action in time and on the other hand with real financial disorder.
Although it only issues 36.1 million euros, it can be convinced that it issues 420 million euros "new and added" in relation to its promises.
Manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems that it is Bercy who made such a decision) could have two negative impacts in the EU at the same time (why would the Member States continue to pay only?) and in the negotiation, because the developing countries are not completely...
The capital of pre-financing is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could be a song of a little more in a huge machine that is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's our case.
Anything, it is necessary to make known from this first year of pre-financing.
France should first notify the change in its way of management of the annual evidence for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and obedience and justice against the final countries of the European Union.
But in particular, France should predict the debate on contributions to financing (other principle of the current debate): we will not find the question of "additionality" or the way to calculate money.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive in these contributions as in the last.
Therefore, everyone puts it into the new Ministry of Life, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, which comes to Cancuna next week.
A surprising statement on the fast start of France and its view of "additionality" and the use of the money could lead to an increase in international confidence that is necessary to continue in discussions.
Alarms about pesticides that children will have.
The 10-year-old child will be after one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published in this middle, from the Buddhist generation association (ex-Munch for the rights and maintaining of future generations).
Associations that warn that its results "notify significant statistical values as regards the low number of analysed samples, but are characteristics for the processed problem," she bought between the July and the summer of food currently consumed in four weeds and one easy food as a lightweight for a child's decades in the supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five kiss of fresh fruit and greenine, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water daily - as sugar, were analysed by research laboratories on chemical substances, pesticides, hard stones and other destructive factors.
Taliban bilance is decreasing: 81 chemical substances, 42 are ranged between carcinogenic, possibly or probably, and five substances belong to the carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that may be used as a wheel for internal mixture (PE), according to the study of some institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although, in all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance accepted are not exceeded individually, in our research we well see that the reality in the exposure of consumers with contaminant substances, may be carcinogenic, and/or injury," says the association.
For eating oil and tea with milk, there are some ten residues with potential cancerogenic and three shown as certain cancerogenes, as it is in about twenty residues that could distort hormonal systems.
Jabbleko, imported from Brazil, studied as a small puzzle, contains the tracks of six chemical substances, notwithstanding the prohibited functional hedge in France.
The same is applied for green fasoils from Kenya, including for dinner, in which the study has discovered the rates of strong insecticides prohibited in the EU.
Moreover, a bift of milk flesh, a tunnel in the woods and even the woods and the wheat were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of an analysis, the presence of dustic and chloroform was discovered.
Steak from loss to dinner was "the richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even the analysis of the plastic talent used to burn food in the micro-volume has not been discontinued.
The final risk for the consumers of this "cocktail of contaminant substances" is probably undervalued," results from the study.
The Ecological Europe-Green (EE-LV) community proposed "the face of importance" to establish a moratorium for the use of pesticides to stop "the growth of civilization diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) studied the status of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and greenly consumed in Europe, from which 76 in cereals.
