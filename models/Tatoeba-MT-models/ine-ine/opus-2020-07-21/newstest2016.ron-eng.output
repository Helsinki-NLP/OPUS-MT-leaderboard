Boss of the United Nations states that there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon claims that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "not a military solution" in the conflict that takes nearly five years and more weapons would do than to wipe violence and suffer millions of people.
The Boss of the United Nations again requested all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban stated Wednesday in a conference that it intended to meet this month with foreign ministers in five permanent countries present in the United States, Russia, China, England and France - at the border of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban was regretful that the divisions between the Syrian people and the regional powers “has made this unresolved action”.
Ban requested the five permanent members to prove solidarity and arrogant unit when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, taking into account the crisis in Syria.
8 numbers of investigations showing that Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a political "flip-flop".
Others called him a bullet.
And others wait for the implosion.
However, independent of how some republicans are trying to give Donald Trump from the top of the investigations, it did not work (if).
Ten of the last 11 national investigations showed that Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two numbers and some voices begin to ask seriously what this means for the possibilities of calling the immune power.
Of course, it's still pregnant.
Nimic of all this doesn't say Trump will win the course to nominate the Republicans.
Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made Herman Cain in investigations, but no one of them won in any state in the nominal course.
And the reasons for which the general elections would be hard to fight are numerous.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservator group accepts Trump's power and begins to support him with money.
We continue to present you a few numbers of recent investigations that suggest that the immune motor is not just something transient:
The numbers that indicate support towards Trump returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidature, in June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth said that only two of the 10 republicans had a positive view of the mobile mobile.
In the middle of July, the percentage went up to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now, six of the 10 republicans have a favorable question about Donald Trump.
Three of the ten claims that they have a negative disorder.
These numbers are maintained.
A study conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republic of the region have a favourable question about Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP's owners would be happy if Trump would win the nominal course.
A study carried out last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of the republicans declared that they would be "entuziasmate" or "gratulations" if Trump would win the nominal course.
Only two of 10 claims that they would be "sovered" if Trump would win the nominal course.
Only Ben Carson generates the same level of entuziasm as Trump (43% states that it would be "entuziasmate" about 40% that declares the same thing about Trump).
The nearest about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the republicans claims that they would be "imulzumits" or "subscribe" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the course for nominalisation.
The republican authorities do not consider Trump's temperature a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for the insults and its bombing style, 52% of the Republicans at national level believe that the immune power has the right temperature to be president, according to the review made by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
We have the same numbers in the state of Iowa, where 52% of the republicans believe that Trump has the personality possible to be leader, according to the investigation carried out last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are supposed that they have no personality necessary to act effectively and almost six of 10 individuals are sure that his temperature does not have what is looking for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
But the Republican people usually have the idea.
When I take the intellectual attitude, the Republicans believe that Trump is.
According to an investigation carried out last week by CNN/ORC, on the question who has the most opportunity to win the GOP nominal course, four of the 10 stated that Trump.
The situation changed to the end of July, when four of the 10 would look like Jeb Bush.
Complete information: in the past, the GOP people did not read the future very well.
At the same time of the last elections, four of the 10 republicans chose Rick Perry in the course of nomination, about 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP electors consider a pleasant Trump campaign.
Even if the republicans or replied to another candidate. Trump is still in front of everyone.
Some votes say that the divided operation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
However, an investigation from the University of Monmouth at the beginning of September shows that, in the hypothetic cooperation between Trump and the majority of the other candidates, Trump will nearly always benefit from majority support.
Trump is located at 13 points from Carly Fiorina, at 14 points of Marco Rubio, at 15 points of Walker, at 19 points of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points towards Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted'z.
The only candidate who wins him?
Ben Carson would win the man with 19 points in a hypothetic conference of one to one.
Donald Trump's supporters' responsibility claims that they have decided.
A new CBS/NYT review on March shows that over half of those supporting Trump does not change its voting option.
Obviously, there can be a lot in this sense, and no one can say that those will never reflect.
46% claims that it leaves ports dismiss the possibility to change its option.
However, the most important opposite of Trump is now the neurochirurgue Ben Carson, but it is two times more like those who claim that they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six of the 10 republicans suggest that I agree with Trump in the immigration problem.
Since Donald Trump called the immigrants in Mexico “violators” in his campaign discourse, two months later, the immigration was the central subject in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombing style will lead to a scandal between the important Spanish and the Republican Party and will audit the efforts of rebranding.
However, according to the review made by ABC/Post on Monday, six of the 10 republicans suggest that I agree with Trump in the immigration problem.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration problem is in reflectors, the Doland Trump will also be.
The frustration towards the authorities touches new clothes.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican people, mostly because of their status of foreigners.
According to the ABC/Post review, six of the 10 republicans claims that they prefer a political outsider in the detriment of a person with experience.
People are also subject to the authorities of Washington.
A study last two weeks in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Iowa republicans are frustrated by the performance of the CONgres republicans, 54 per cent by declaring that they are "neulzummiti" and 21 per cent "nervoids".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debt to the Prime Minister's
Since his choice, Mr Corbyn to PMQs was delayed.
The new leader of the Laburist Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his deputy later at the Prime Minister's ́ons, meeting for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions which he has the right to shortly after the dead; its performance will probably be analysed nearly by the media and labour parliamentaries.
In the weekly events, he requested “better theater and more facts”.
He also stated that it could be rejected by some participants and that he was sent to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn in the position of leadership, coming after he called a "pantomic cabinet" and after the speaking that he held on Thursday at the TUC annual convention.
In time, the decision of the leader of the Labour party to keep silence in the publication of the national name in a work held in March at the 75th anniversary of England was critical from a conservative parliamentary and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to song the national name was aware
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn stated that “he kept the silence respectfully” and repeated“the British Air Forces’ eroism in England”.
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's fantom cabinet, Oweneuith, stated for the EEC Two's Newsnight transmitted by BBC that it would have been recommended to the labour leader to sing the national "inferrent" name of faith that the monarch should be abolited.
About twelve ministers in the fantastic cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's main team, argumenting by differences in economic, appearance and external opinions, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The political representative of the BBC, Robin Brant, states that the political differences are "compulsed" in the Laburist Party after the name of Mr Corbyn concerning its position towards the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr. Corbyn stated at the TUC conference that the Laburist Party will bring initiatives that will be removed by the integral idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr. Lt., Minister of Municipality and Pensions, stated that the party "is very clear" in a position towards the plans to reduce the level of "cap" from 26,000 litres to 23,000 litres.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth labour leader with David Cameron at the court last decade since he took the leadership of the Conservator Party.
The labourist leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he has the ideas of "external sources" for questions to address Mr Cameron and that he received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North said that PMQs includes a too high level of conference and that it will be left from the replies and attacks, committing it to replace serious problems, such as poverty, inequality and challenges to young people.
Mr Corbyn stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister for Finance, will keep the place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr Cameron moves to foreign.
He also expressed the idea that other colleagues would be allowed to take the occasional word, saying that he had addressed the Chamber President John Bercow to discuss this aspect.
In 2005, when he took the leader, Mr Cameron stated that he wanted to reject the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs but repeated a few years later that he did not succeed in his debt.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs was considered a key barometer of the ratio of a leader, the way it leads to the Lawyers and its position in the Parliamentary colleagues, although criticisms were likely to become a cargo, and it needed a deep reform.
“Cadro in Joburg”: Youths without adoption benefit from photo courses
It's difficulty to be a man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to teach a mastery and win their lives.
"I was shot in Joburg" is an unusual study that teachs youths without fail to make photos of the areas where they live and win money from it.
BBC News met one of the first resolvers of the project.
Boss JD Sports says the biggest salaries could make extension.
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, states that a growth of the minimum salary in British Sea could mean “a greater purchase power in consumer potential buyers”.
However, it is at least probably that the purchasing power to deduct the largest costs for the workforest in the company, it refers to it.
The costs could have impact on JD Sports extension plans, added it, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a colateral victim in the "fortuna" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more loving and not critical words, in the opinion of President Tennis'a, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the tightest part of the two talented part of the “Special Ks” often, was lately inappropriate in reflectors from the scandal degree that Kyrgio had before Stan Wawricka at the Montreal Masters tour.
A quickly-qualification mechanism after, in Ciōinnati, the throne arbitre had to interview two times to divide Kokkinakis and his opposite Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put it on the ground on Kirgiso, and I should have put it on the ground on this pool."
Although it was seen last time making a pulp racket after he had muscle craps and rated a possible US Open tour, suspected by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was fairly seen by Healy.
The adolescent is now located in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for two places in individual, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal Cupei Davis against England.
"A thing I feel strong is that, after I appeared, Thanasi was a little in conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he's cut a racket when he lost because he accused cramps in the United States, but he's not the first player who breaks a racket from frustration before himself and knows Thanasi enough well to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, it's been very good in the facts that it's a lot of provocation in the US with Harrison and so far and I think it's a lot of confidence.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a family together and I think he's been treated wrongly.
It's a 19-year-old twinty-year-year-old twice, working hard and integrated in the team, having no kind of conflict with other players, it's very respected for the advertising, it's hard, it's in a excellent form, it's a very balanced and mature twer, and I think it's deserved to be judged on the basis of its qualities and deficits.
Healy also supported the decision not to calculate Kyrgio for the important remission mechanism, which begins Thursday, and described “common decision” as the most possible for all, but supported the return of the player originating from Canberra for a long term in the team.
"For the first time, we want the team to make it completely on the remise mechanism and not thinking about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick went very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray, he maturized himself under the public views and did no worst mistakes and deserved to be criticized, but we try to support him, try to help him understand his consequences and I think he needs a time when he is not in the centre of attention to reflect, what is good for the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders reduced half in national investigations
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, continues to benefit two digits in the democratic course for national candidature, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the territory.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic (from 58%), while Sanders is in two places, with 27% (in some case of 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced if he will candidate to the Presidency, is supported by 15% of the Democratic.
With at least five months before the beginning of the primary elections, most democratic electors say it's too early to say that they've decided the candidate they'll support.
But Clinton's supporters are firmer in their choice than other candidates.
In view of the research carried out by the CBS news last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton keeps the advantage of women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
The maintenance in the boys has been significantly reduced and Sanders is located at a distance of only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in the democrated electors under 50 years has been evaporated, being now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in advantage in the range of elderly electors.
Last month, Clinton is in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two digits, in the range of liberals, but Sanders now has a easily advantage of 5 points in this group.
A half of the democrats at national level states that it would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it had chosen to candidate on behalf of the party.
A sfert would have supported it as reserved and another 15% would only support it because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unexpectedly, the probability that Clinton's current supporters are enthusiasmed by this choice is high.
The opinions are more mixed about those who do not support Clinton now - at least a sfert would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of the democratic states that it would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of republican electors who declare the same thing about the first classified, Donald Trump (35%) is less.
When Clinton's supporters are addressed a dismissed question about the reason why she wants to win the course, the majorist response is that it holds adequate experience (16%), followed by the fact that a woman came to be president (13%) and that it is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
These aspects and eligibility are also mentioned.
Since the President has calculated a possible candidate at the Presidency, 57% of the democratic people would like to see him in the course - even though a third of them believe that it should not be candidate.
At the question of the second option for the representative of the party, the democratic majorists call him Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half suggests Biden would be the second option, much before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate in the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton in front of Sanders grows, from 20 points with Biden at 30 points if it doesn't candidate.
55% of the democratic people considers the Clinton candidate with the greatest opportunity to win the general elections; but the numbers were reduced from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is remote in two places but the percentage according to which the most eligible has grown.
However, when you are wondering what is the most important to a selected candidate, the democratic people prefer the problems instead of accuracy.
As last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by those of the participants as unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential course.
Democrated candidates or the possible candidates are well in relation to some key characteristics towards the primary parties of their party.
The responsibility of the electors considers Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrated and trusted and having solid qualities of leaders.
Biden is seen the best of all three about integrity, while the strong point of Clinton is the leadership.
30% of the democratic people don't think H. Clinton's integral and trusting, twice more than those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% have no idea about it in this sense.
The democrats also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideas as they.
Referring to all these aspects, a sfert of the democratic people does not have any opinion on Sanders.
As the issues of the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was State Secretary, most democratic electors are grateful for the explanation of this subject and say that it has not affected their general appearance towards the candidate.
But things are otherwise in the American public.
The half of the Americans are now injured by her explaining, while almost a threeth is moleculed.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the question came out to the hall.
The American authorities claim that this e-mail-related controversy has not affected their general appearance of Clinton, although 36% claim that they have changed their appearance in negative sense.
First of the Republic, more than six of the 10 states that they have changed their appearance of Clinton in negative sense.
Although the democratic electors consider the integral and confidential Clinton, this aspect continues to rise problems in general electors: only 32% considers integral and confidentiality, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of the people do not consider it integral and trusted.
At the same time, 55% of the national operators do not consider the integral and loyal Trump.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white birds for leadership.
Among the six evaluated candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are classified first in respect of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integral is greater than those who are not the same thing but in case of Carson, many have no idea about him.
The size of error for the testing of 351 of the primary democrats is of 6 percent points.
Five members of the brethren under accusation for the killing of the student in the year 1 of the Baruch Faculty
On nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initial Ritual of the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five were accused of crime.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraction from the Baruch Faculty of New York attacked the Chun "Michael" Deng brutally during a starting ritual in September 2013 and encouraged him to go to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to the police statements.
The official sources say that the victim was linked to the eyes, put him in the back a 14-kg snippet full of sand and was brushed repeatedly while he tried to move to a tent, on a wounded territory.
Mr. Deng accused head pain after he lost his knowledge.
The members of the Friday Pi Delta Psi didn't call the number of urgency after it was leaving and claiming it would have been stuck a hour before he'd gone to the hospital, says the police.
But they found the time needed to change Deng's clothes, look for this symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at national level, to ask his advice, declared the police boss, Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
"In this moment, members began to hide personal goods and practice the goods of fraternity before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and die the second morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered traumatisms repeated to the head, shops and coaps.
"Too many have been devastated by brethren rituals, at least one student lost life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Brothers and members must be responsible and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Great Yu’s district of Monroe recommended that the first five members be accused of crime for three degrees.
Other thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be punished under accusation of ultraj and complication of crime.
"We want to be responsible not only for the involved, but if there is a organization that authorised the fraternity, official or inofficial, we will also take it to response," Wagner stated in March to a press conference.
Baruch's faculty prohibited the fraction and the national fraction rejected its affiliation with local representative.
That's what will happen when the Federal Reserve will increase the rate of profits
The rental rate will grow and pia’s bull (ground) will be poetic, renewable obligations will grow and will enter into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to be and how long it's going to be.
In economy, the story offers little index on time-based framework..
After the first growth of the profit rate, the recession was produced in only 11 months and was 86 months.
The agressivity of the Federal Reserve to increase the rate of profit is often, although not always, a determining factor of how the response and financial assets are.
Therefore, the United States Central Bank officers have so strongly accented that investors should not be held at the time when it begins to increase the profit rate, but the time traveller needed to normalize.
Actually, in the game there are multiple variables.
However, at the end, market players could find that all age related to the growth of the profit rate was exhausted.
“The first increase of the debt rates decided by Fed after the world financial crisis will be interpreted inevitable by some votes as a sign of the ear of “effect banks”, stated Julian Jessop, head of Economy at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to the clients.
In contrast, we don't expect the past return of the US winning rats to normaler levels, but still small to constitute the seismic shock that seems to be afraid of.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how some sectors of the economy could respond, based on historical trends:
In view of the situation with which pia`a has been confronted in the last months, the precipient of the rate of profit can volatilize things for a while.
However, at the time of growing, the impact is not so dramatic.
“It seems that there is a tendency to stop capital rentability between 12 and 24 months after the first growth, which reflects the defasage of the monetary policy again,” said Deutsche Bank analyzers in a recent study on what will be done after Fed creation.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the pia’s growth increased - with about 14 percent - directing to the increase of the profit rate, quite incapable in 250 days after (all average of 2,6 per cent) after returning to normally after 500 days, with a average return in the last six cycles of 14,4 per cent, according to a recent analysis published by Barron by the Boss Noveen Asset Management Strategy.
Deutsche stated that the impact of actions has trend to become more pronounced in the growth rate cycle and the benefits begin to lose.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but increased profit rate often contributes to it.
In the face, Fed is confronted with anything that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the brute internal product will be close to its minimum point the same for a growth of the rate of Fed profit.
According to Deutsche Bank, from the 118 rent rates since 1950, only two times the nominal PIB was less than 4,5%.
Even if the value was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, the third trimester only reached 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The growth of the profit rate in such a fragil economy could be risked and could rise to the question “if this time it is decreased”, said Deutsche.
The market players have prepared all the year for a growing decision from Fed, all the eyes are careful for the meeting of this week of the Federal Commission of the Deschise Market, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategies and economicists believe that FOMC could increase the rate of profits at the time of this meeting, the transactions at the time indicate the probability of only 25%.
“In our study followed after 1950, all growth cycles of profits are now found in a super cycle of growth of profit, and the PIB has laid down the rubbers before the recession very quickly after the start of the recovery,” the report stated.
Instead, this was a strange recovery long after the severe recession of the analysis period.
The current cycle is far the longest expected by Fed from the end of the last receipt; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continued.
The fixed arrival was also volatile, in view of that the pia’s predicts a growth of the profit rate and the printer is similar to the dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the obligations than in the case of actions when Fed is political.
In the case of obligations, the benefits seem to change the direction immediately when the first increase/reduction of the cycle is produced.
At the end of the growth cycle of the profit rate, the rentability of the obligations is immediately expired,” said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab is determined that these profit rates will determine the approach of rentality between short-term obligations and long-term rate, extending the curve.
High rental obligations are better in such a environment, although “We are still careful for the performance of rentability”, stated in an analysis of Kathy Jones, analysed on fixed income in the Swab.
In interesting manner, Jones thinks that markets have already been adapted to Fed's policies.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and decrease of estimated inflation, there are some signs that the pia has been adapted to the perspective of a stricter monetary policy," wrote Jones.
The rate of profits in short terms has increased, the rental curve is more right, the average rate of credit increased and volatility increased - all the market characteristics when Fed exercises policy.
In large lines, companies that perform their majority activities in the United States will be won by the growth of the profit and the local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with big debts will suffer because the increase of the dollar will lead to the expansion of their products in the world market and their debt will be faster.
“The story shows that the “quality” stocks have trend to be more profitable in the three months later of an initial growth of profit," said Goldman Sachs analysis in a report to the clients.
The firms with powerful balances have expelled those with a weak balance after each of the profit rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with a average of 5 percent points.
Companys with large capital and lower volatile stocks have also expired similar companies with an average quality of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important problem.
Companys with a large floating debt have the most lost, Goldman.
Consumers will also win from the growth of the dollar.
Those who economy could also win, although experts do not agree how quickly this will be done.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, parliamentary Andrew Bingham
Conserving parliamentary Andrew Bingham criticized the radio post because it was "left"
This suggests that it is from what more similar to the commercial opposer
He also took the BBC Music Awards eye, assuring that the Brits premises were plagued
College Damien Collins attacked The Voice, showing that neither this is original
BBC Radio 3 is "transformed into" Classic FM, stated a major parliamentary, pressing the post to prove that it does something that commercial posts do not do.
The conservator Andrew Bingham also transmitted to the BBC leaders that the public radio post "slides" and is still more like the commercial opponent.
"I'm impressed that Radio 3 "sounds" - even though I don't like to use the word - but I'm impressed that it's converted into Classic FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards eye, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seems to be Brits under another name.
So if you are trying to do something - these are the two examples I am in mind that do not do but to copy what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC has refused the accusations, providing that BBC Radio 3 is much in front of his commercial opponent in relation to live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find anybody about the classic music I find from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to the radio 3 post commitment to discover new music and allocation of new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, editor BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, stated that he needs to make more effort to attach audience to the previous period because the British people have less knowledge of classic music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element found under the BBC sign criticized during the meeting of the Cultural, media and sport committee because it would follow his commercial rivals.
The Voice - the talent show bought by BBC by the Netherlands producer Talpa Media for a total of approximately 22 million litres of sterlines.
Do you understand why there are often discussions relating to this opinion because it is not original and does not distinguish by nothing?
Lord Hall insisted that the show performed by BBC1 - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in Juy - to be performed "in a specific way of BBC".
He added that it wants that the Corporation “to be a golden egg in its own ography” date of life when it starts a show of fun.
Nevertheless, he refused to prohibit the future receipt of new seasons from The Voice or to expend the money that goes on licences in other forms of divertising.
The online sales recorded the smallest growth in August and the guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month the latest growth of 2000 is currently registered.
The online sales have been seen three years ago, due to the use of the phone to purchase.
Specialists are determined that Black Friday in November could determine retizen.
Over a decade, online purchases exploded and transformed trade streets from British Sea into fantasy towns.
Specialists, however, say that there are signs that online sales are reduced, the last numbers have a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total of money expensed in August has presented the latest increase of 2000 per cent currently, with only 5 per cent increase in the last year.
Specialists say that there are signs that online sales are reduced, the last numbers have a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we analyze the level of growth in the previous years and return to 2000, there was always a rationalised trend in time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor to the IMRG sales index for Guardian.
He explained that online sales had been done three years ago, when the buyers started using the mobile phone to make buyers.
So he increased the number of persons who could make online purchases and could do it in different circumstances, such as on the canapy.
But now you can see a decrease (scale).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the delay of sales.
In the opinion of specialists, the purchasers would be left from making accommodations before the event that has happened last Friday in November.
The past year, five times the average number of buyers had been thrown before computers to put his hands on offers, which led to the detailing sites of more details.
Specialists are determined that Black Friday, when the buyers were baptized on the chilips, could determine the retizens of the buyers.
A study published by British Retail Consortium determined that at least 1 £ of each 5 £ is costed online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and space machines, more than a third of the accommodations are currently performed through online storages.
At the same time, more than one sfert than one of them prefers to buy clothes and pantofis online than to join mode stores in commercial areas.
After the sanction of the Bin Laden family, the Muslims buried the victims killed after the destruction of the macar in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were running on the streets of Muslims, the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially won the gigant in the Saudi Binladin Group construction.
The Ministry of Health stated that in total 394 years were hurt in the light of the destruction of the macar
In the street walking ceremony, hundreds of muslims gathered together to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a moschee sea in Mecca.
You clothe in white, those who crying about their dead were on the road to express their condoleans, for when the first dead came to the end of the final trip, at the cimiter of Al-Moaissem.
The trist memory held by the holy place, where only a few days later a construction mask was broken through the Mosque's taven, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funerals after the king of Saudi Arabia sanctifyed the Bin Laden family building group for disaster, which also was soldiered with 394 wounds.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of muslims gathered together to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a moschee sea in Mecca.
Among the victims, the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pelerinage when the macarau was cut off.
Mr. Akram is located in the Moschee Sea with his parents before the beginning of the annual haey.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the haj pelerinage in Mecca will continue, thousands of pearls continue to reach in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group shouldn't have left the arm of the macar when the mask wasn't working.
A Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group is partly guilty of destruction.
The service in English of the news agency did not provide that detail, but the company leaders received a prohibition to appear.
Earlier during this week, Salman swore to discover what caused the macar in the court of Marii Moschei, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came before the haey pillary that has happened later this month.
The Binladin group has not yet made statements on the deployment of the macar and the representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The king's decree has accused the group because he did not use updated and did not coordinate its activities with the Ortology authorities.
Ten macars around the Moschee Sea in Mecca, as part of the massive building effort led by the Binladin Group.
Since a few decades, Binladin's family has a close relationship with the real family of Saudi Arabia and has deducted major construction projects.
The last leader Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renewed" son, a family democracy in the 1990s.
The rain was produced in powerful wind and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pelerinaj, essential travel at least once in life.
The authorities declare that 158 in hospital.
The authorities decided that the roots of victims who were determined to receive a million Saudites Riali (174.000 litres sterlines) and the same amount to pay to those who are permanently wounded.
Other wounds will receive half of this sum.
Advantages and disvantages of the conversion of credits to Switzerland francs
On the market, the bank has already appeared two conversion offers to the Swedish French credits, the main benefits are the exclusion of the evaluation risk and the reduction of rates.
Desvantages can come over many years, when the prospect of variables can lead to the increase of rats.
Bank Transilvania tocmai completed the process on the conversion of credits in francs granted by Volksbank, and Bankpost announced a conversion offer for its own customers.
According to the collected data of the FinZoom Financial Portal analysis, Bankpost offered three years of fixed legal duty, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of the Transilvania Bank was accepted by 83% of the French credit customers due to the second successive reduction: the payment was reduced with the value of the risk and customer payment, and then an additional reduction of 22,5% was applied to the loan in law.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, the girl's payment for a month equivalent to law before the conversion.
Thus, Bank Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bankpost, 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, with 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the covery in the CHF credits is to eliminate the currency, the consumer is protected by the viable frank cresters, and the refund of the credit will be made in the currency in which the salary is involved.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that it is not reevaluating property, no further guarantees and another evidence of income.
In practice, a new financial and legal analysis of the credit will not be made and will not be additional costs as in case of refinancing.
Both of them also offered a reduction at the month rate, the girl of how many customers payed before the conversion, equivalent to the law.
Risco
The problem is that the rate in the first years is the format of more than the doband, and the customer is very small in the main.
Bancpost offer with a very little donation in the first three years seems the advantage for customers.
You didn't know how this will evolute three years ago.
The size offered to customers may be more than 3.25%, so totally, and the reduction of costs is less.
A possibility of risk for all lay credits with variable doband, is that the ROBOR indexs would create significantly in the following years (more than the Libor - CHF indexs).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1,44%, but in 2013 has reached the value of 6%, 2009, over 15%, and in a few days of 2008 has over 40%!
Moreover, it is possible to provide other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
It has reached the time of decisions on the rates for the United States Federal Reserve
The world focuses on the meeting planned over two days, Thursday and Thursday, when the United States Federal Reserve will take a crucial decision if it grows or not the benefit rates for the first time after a decade.
A survey resulted by Re日s with the participation of 80 economists, at least over half the last week believed that the decision would be taken, now I believe that the rate of profits will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a similar event because they have spent seven years since the Federal Reservation has brought the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are confronted with an action where a major central could reject at zero rate and initiate a normalization process of profit rates," Angel Ubide analyzed Chief Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has developed relatively well, bringing three million dollars into the balance and generating a lower inflation level.
However, the Federal Reserve should not ignore the globality less rose.
He warned the markets to prepare for a growth, but there are signs that p' and they believe that such movement is less likely.
The decision will be announced March, 20:00 CET.
See who lost his pharmacist
Actor (left), with his son Redmond (right), passed through stressing activities in the past years.
In 2001, he was fighting with leucemy and in 2009 and lost a partner of life, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
It is also claimed that the actor would have been confronted with the problem of drug consumption and was arrested for drug posation in 2008.
All of these have a cost.
Luke Shaw player from Manchester United is on bar a few months due to double fractions.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture on the right pig in the meal played by Manchester United in the Campions Liga, ended with a break in the face of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought him lacrimes in the eye of the player and who will keep it on the bar at least six months, Louis van Gaal'ne optimist that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The work has occurred following an unusual intervention from Hector Moreno at 15 minutes, after Shaw, 20 years old, dismissed the PSV appearance.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he was gone to hospital.
Van Gaal stated: "He has a double fracture on the pig and is in the hospital."
He's gonna be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow then he'll be operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United at 18 years of age, happens difficulties, then plays fantastic and now it seems like that.
His oxygen mask was put in the news.
Plage.
I'm not a doctor, but at a double fracture the rest is six months and it's not going to play in the group phase.
I hope you can play this season again.
It seems like Moreno had happiness and escaped from the red carton and the concession of a penalty shot.
Arbitr Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can juice alone when I say it's a fault and red carton.
It was a very harmful intervention, with two.
A message from Shaw's Twitter account: "I thank you all for messages, I don't have words to express how weak I feel, I start the way to recover, I'll be stronger."
Similar scientists: Manchester United wounded by Luke Shaw accident in PSV breakfast
The Fund of England's team has a further reason to recover it to play at the European Campionate in France in the next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, the leader of PSV, said, "It's a very hated accident."
Everyone is very trist when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never follow the accident of an opposite.
Moreno threw his pitch playing for Mexico's national against the Netherlands nation carried by Van Gaal to the World Campionate of 2014.
"It's very hard because he's not intended to hurt his opposite, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," said Cocu.
I didn't see the phase.
I couldn't see but the cow, which was right in another direction, so he thought [Moreno] had touched it, but I could not see Luke's intervention.
In the SBS6, Moreno stated: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to pass through such something.
I feel stupid before, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived to the hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's disappointment but still keeps strong
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficulty, but after I saw the team selected by England for tour, I did not calculate a repair of 3-0 in the test mechanisms.
I wouldn't remove the variance of a victory in moving.
Alastair Cook's team may have less experience than three years ago, but he has good spin players in the line and the collective moral is strong; they will not be marked by 2012's experiences, but will have a positive attitude.
Moeen Ali develops as spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is our at the test level, it represents an option for attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth has spent the team of England for test mechanisms and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his main trainer at Yorkshire, I'm distressed to analyze the decision not to choose Adam Lyth in the team.
He played the seven test mechanisms against two good attackers, in difficulty, and the reality simply but hard is that cricket players are played after results.
There were no question signs related to Joe Root, for example, when the announcements were made because - and I said this before - players are their own electors.
I wanted fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destination is in his hands.
I hope if you do more runs for Yorkshire will have a part of other opportunities.
The main entrenor of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised her attitude even when Performan was not at the measure of his ownness and doesn't surprise me; first, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question how long a batsman's notice in test mechanisms.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had happiness home and moved.
The only impatience you could have was that England prefered Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in the maximum form - but that rated occasion is the area of the past.
In the team, Alex Hales is coming, a bathman I'm cooking very well.
It's a cricket player who has the "X factor" and which we've previously noticed in Yorkshire in this season when he marked 236 against us at a Trent Bri.
It should be given to him at least the same opportunity that those before it will certainly depend on the UAE team.
It was launched the idea that Moeen would break the bathroom near Cook, which would bring extra spinner while keeping four kicks at the same time, and I've got nothing contrary.
I don't see why a shooter couldn't shoot there, and this left player has already shown that it's given to the fuck.
Maybe Moeen didn't succeed in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for those, so the difference is not big.
My old team colleague, Justin Langer, played 38 first test mechanisms 38 as the first drop before it was opened in 2001.
He went off three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the team on the back-up spinner post and, although I had a limited contact with him, he hit me the fact that it was a very impressive t.
People could jude his fraged age - with a average of 31 to bathy and 35 at the minge - and may think it is a point, but there is not a number of spinners, and the elections have chosen for youth.
He'll learn many of this tour.
England brought a few boards in the team of trainers.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lanka batsman, as consultant for test mechanisms, could be a master's wound.
It's one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, since it's played in any way and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball link of the tour and will produce both energy and untrusted ambition.
I've always thought he was born to involve in the international cricket, either as player or a trainer, and like Mahela, he's intuition.
Sometimes, new voices from the newspaper, even if you send messages that have been transmitted and previously, you can carry a bad air in the team.
Colly Durham's companion, Ben Stokes relaxed for the meals one day, Root received a similar pause against and I don't have any problem with this.
Although they are not all agreed, trainers and elections do not do the program.
And you have to keep, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions will never be easily taken.
The tabernacle Brexit could have winning due if it remained in acalm p¤ 2017
On the day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to maintain the British Sea in the EU is still stronger, even without choosing Jeremy's genial "Yes or not?" Corbyn at the leading of the Laburist Party or TUC makes serious criticism to Europe.
Foreigners have their characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic explained last days that - in similar crisiss with the EU - not all being in the internal cause - some Member States are feeded by the British Marie Concession and Concessions agenda, which most of them do not want.
In Brighton, at the time of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they wouldn't even want this if they would erode social protection.
We could even call Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Prime Minister and the canceller participate in bilateral sums or sessions in foreign capitals, make a position in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won the reform alias.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with a perspective outside the EU - "Do not leave us alone with Frank," Berlin suggests that many ministers and officers obtained from certain capitals have reached the point where they are not concerned if they are going or gone.
Angela Merkel, the extremely predicted German canceller, is an aliat but has been in carrying for 10 years and wants to overcome the position before her company clatines, such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too much.
In 2017, President of France, François Holland, will be real or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could have soon a right nationalist, Spain one left.
It is hard to believe that they will help English whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from getting out of the United Kingdom - something they do not want because most of them have similar separatist trends.
Thus, some ministers could even plan to make an intentional comment that, in the style of SNP, does not help in the campaign for the References campaign in the United Kingdom of 2017 to overcome Brexit process, suggests my friend.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "The Great Britain has not received anything from renegotiation."
Europeans know on their skin how acaparatour can be Fleet Street and how sceptics are the oligarch press baronies looking at the EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the Reference of 1975 inspired by Tony Benn, which has made our entrance in 1973 in the report 2:
Maybe I remember Boris Johnson, the euro-oportunist, who became a celebration at the beginning of the 90s when it was appropriate in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knows his enemies.
They included the mixture of tax non-payers, foreigners who broadcast phone and pseudo non-domes who hold the majority of the important journals.
In fact, Tony Blair looked at a little like that, but she realized that when you're in a cow close to a nervous gorilla, you need to give the bananas to take attention from thinking to eat you back to the tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in a position towards Cameron's referendum idea, taking into account that Blair made a concession on the principle against the abandoned EU constitution, buried by the French and the Netherlands members in 2005, which offered him an output card.
Pressa didn't forgive him for this.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me, friends behind Monday at Westminster - I told him not to consume his time with me anymore - it seems to be in danger to adopt Neil Kinnock's boxing strategy in the 80s, a mistake then and now.
Perhaps, but it must develop a coherent media cooperation strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose position at BBC has left her on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn towards Europe is what I would call indulgency evolution.
This states that we would like to put it into a reformed EU.
The responsibility of those who do not agree with the “anglicism” conservators may be in accordance with this.
This said Hilary “A Benn, but not a Bennite” Benn at the radio and TV this week, when the researcher of him struck not to recognize that John McDon’s name by Corbyn as a minister for the "smooth" was a bad idea of financial problems.
He reminded me of the 70s when his father struck the TV to be unloyal to labour colleagues, without going too far and losing his function in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But fighting "in any way" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDon said and not to what JC said to colleagues and parliamentaries in the private meeting of Monday night.
Independent of the picture that Corbyn wants to translate - keep me, he has also kept me - the discipline of the important messages in the era of television and, in particular, in the earlier of social networks, a paranoia and travel.
It's right to not give Cameron a favourable billet in Europe, allowing them to support the labs in the campaign for referendum, as McDon's said.
Simon Jenkins believes this.
However, the basic sophism of McDon and Corbyin on the quality of EU membership - in accordance with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer a ezoteric discussion in the left-by-subsidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
Like in the case of his sophism on NATO - Tom Watson is inclined on the fact that JC will not do campaign for refusal - foreign diplomats will be obligated to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin irritate the political capital - and there are suspicious suspicious ones - for concessions against the British Sea when everything could be unusual?
U.S. have already been very disappointed by the low military performan of English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservator who takes the costs, as I was reminded of the launch of British Influence Security Forum, Monday.
Critical Specialists Decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the agency’s performances of electronic cigarettes are 95% less damage than the fum resulted in a meeting between 12%, some of them with the tune industry.
Specialists in the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the publication of Lancet in criticing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in his report on electronic citizens.
The PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complete analysis of evidence".
However, some researchers doubted the strength of the data, and they reached the fingerprints between anonymous experts and the tune industry.
An article published last month in the medical magazine Lancet attacked the "excellent basis of fragil" which the PHE founded its main conclusion.
Other two researchers written in BMJ have signed the question and the foundation of them “on solid earth or on a moved ground”.
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at London Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, clinical epidemiological teacher at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on effectiveness."
They were expected to be the PHEs according to which “the current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are less damage than smoke” are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, one meeting in which 12 people participated led to the creation of a model of decision-making with multiple criteria (MCDA) to synthesize their appearances regarding the negative effects associated with the products containing nineotine; the results of this meeting have been shortly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell or that one of the sponsors of the meeting was an EuroSwiss Health company, of whom the Executive Director said that it would have been received financially from British American Tobacco for a independent study.
It also validated the BAT credit in public health in a sustainability report, which has been performed.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the finance received by a electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the financial report that it would have received from the company producing cigarettes and tutun, Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which the members of the panel were selected, but some of them were numbered “fruiting” known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declared in the financial work of the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for expertise in the control of the tunnel.
At the meeting, the Chief of the Tutun Control Section also participated in the PHE.
The research work designed by the group "mussamizing in a convinced manner" is the fact that there are " solid evidence on the damage effect that most products have in accordance with the majority of the criteria", McKee and Capewell.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these restrictions or restrictions.
McKee and Capewell have stated that the PHE's responsibility that "for now there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking in children or infirmers" are prejudices.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE Health Department, states that it has been answered in the past to BMJ.
He stated: "Electronic claims are significantly less damage than smoke"
One of the two who smoked the whole life loses their lives because of this victory.
All evidence suggests that the risk of electronic health cigarettes is less comparable, but we must continue studying long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about information that rees and those which do not prove, particularly taking into account the high degree of public confusion on relative risks compared to the tune.
Anual, about 80,000 of them lose their lives because of a bottle associated with fum and the annual costs supported by the national health system due to the smoke are reached to 2 billion litres.
Explaining clearly the current evidence - and as well as the use of your electronics is not a risk, it is only a fraction of the damage of the fum - we comply with our national duty.

The claims that make britain's weapons trade shame
Follow the film performed by Amnesty International against the weapons charge.
Drone's murdering horrible!
The beast for the throat of the glasses!
Bombs with dispersion!
And electric bastons that cause pains without let it follow!
The joyful voice and animated images do not doubt that this reclamation for the greatest world weapons rate is a wide open, made by Amnesty International to highlight the desire to the British authorities to sell arms of the regimes representing by the Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to showing a large number of posts in bus stations and in metros that need one second look.
"A important announcement, traveling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turns into a tank image.
In September of this year, a lot of weapons will be released › DLR clients are requested to contribute to the stop of the weapons rate.
The 300 posts are made by artists who exposed the works to the Museel Designs, Dismaland, Banksy.
A group named Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack ́ks", a 6-liter key package of Allen, which states that "facilitates a third of the public space from the bus stations on the planet".
The transport Kingdom of London is not amazed by this “vandalism” in the form of flights.
One of the parodia announcements produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator Designs and Conference at the University of Essex, artists put out what more questions and seeking to do political works of the public outside the gallery.
Many artists are directed to collaboration with actors in protest movements, realizing that they must go out in the real world so that their art affects society.
Another poster against the weapons trade that occurs to the metrosts.
The film performed by Amnesty had more than 1000,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP public agency who worked for bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free.
The VCCP creation Director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the licitation for the lock of arms - with a empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let us offer campaigns that they are trying to avoid."
They played with a more realistical claim, but “with powerful animations and colours, it was more exciting”.
"I've done a work by helping us to increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment in the market," said Tom Davies in the name of Amnesty.
Now, the British authorities would need to take measures and ensure that torture equipment are not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the theme of the weapons trail comes from the inside of ExCeL, where exposures offer fantastic efficiency products.
In a press communication, Saab developed a ≥ receipt from the US army on “AT4CS RS with lansator on the shore”.
This includes “a single form of focus that offers oil effects behind the arms, within the tent.
Anything that would mean, it wouldn't be done.
Eight gold rules to live in the road
It's been 11 years since I moved to the road, when I was 19 years old, who believed still in beer and moral relationship, but I just remember my dreams for those I've envyed -- and the number of crying at the address of others.
The illness of the things I've learned can be counted in the form of eight simple rules.
Movement in the road may lead to states that varie from the nervous fall to the threat.
The wedding is tempted: tell people from where you are, if and where you have been a year of break from studies, what you say about Corbyn and why, "It's inevitable, Marmit, because, for good boys, it's nothing else than HAHAHAHA's extraction, you find me in my room."
Respire closely.
And help others to breathe - ask questions and care for your interest.
This encourages the conversation and helps you to distinguish the things you like from those with whom you don't talk or if the popular would come and they would be the only ones that would have children.
Don't suspect people.
The sleeps are often abundant with bathrooms, movies and socialization meetings, but they are the place where people break and try their intimate treasure.

Introvertises are part of special treatment at the university.
Your sleeper should be a rejou, but in many roads, it is built a spring culture through beds, based on friendship, socialization and friends that dure all life.
All these can be terrible for someone who trys to load his battery.
Nimic in this culture doesn't allow you to say, "You liked and wanted to have friends but they wanted you to go to restore my energy that I consumed by interacting with you."
Try to seize when a colleague is extended by socialization - and try to send a SMS instead of fighting at the door.
Let the fucking talk come to the door: do it.
A guy stood on the same road with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't closed, then he was invited to enter.

Congratulations prepared in the house are a way to make your friends.
Your colleagues will feel obligated to stand talking and may be able to associate your figure with a pleasant surprise.

Now it's at the morning.
Don't let others sleep or study.
It's not just because it keeps a good feeling, but because you're going to your own cups.
A girl on the pair with me asked her neighbor to give her music quietly because it was 3 hours in the morning and had an exam tomorrow.
Their reaction was to give a stronger music.
When they stopped the music at a end, at the 5th morning, the girl was amazed and left them sleep two hours before they had the highest way to music, she closed the door and went to the trial trip.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband or wife would move on the same pair?
In contrast, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you confunded a pailer colleague with the future husband, you've cut up, you've split, and you should meet you sick and maybe even see him how all of the common friends live?
Of course, you can't oppose your hearts - but if a sexy pailer colleague is not your future husband, at least try to be racious.
When you realize that someone left his keys in the unlocked room, the line between board and intimidation is more beautiful than seems.
A successful cup is amazing, but it can denature in a few moments.

Close the door and put the keys in a cup of water that you get to the congelator - but don't stick the goods of someone of the taven more than twice.
David Grimal: At Bach’s time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French Violonis David Grimal is one of the big artists of our time, not just as solist but also as an initiator of a less usual project, to the right of "humanity", as he even says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formated by international solists and talented musicians, which interpreted a symphonic repertorium without having a leader, and this makes it at least a curiosity in the classic musical field.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two spectacles: a representation, a Sunday, in which the solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when the violoncelist Xavier Phillips was first found, the works composed of Enescu were nelipsed.
Both spectaculars, discovered on the Athens scene, showed the public another way to interpret the classic music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, being the only classic music assembly in which there was no leader.
The director is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true that musicians, on one hand, need education or to become solistics, or to be interpreted in an orchestra - speaking of instrumentists, not of composers.
They're formatted as "specialized puzzles".
They also have the impression that they need a leader.
On the other hand of the scene, for public, all musical feetization is accused of the leader.
And so, business, music industry, they make marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have qualified workers, what's stupid, and a public that can't do it, but must see what is stupid," David Grimal considers.
The Violonic indicates that this change in the way music makes come after "music deceptions" from his solist carriage.
I was like a high-level athlete that had to do the same exercise in the world with orchestress, to punish many money and to gain money and music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressive, because I didn't find human creativity and brothership in this system.
So I haven't found any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create the Dissonances.
This happens in 2004, and at that time nobody did so without a leader: "The Music, extreme conservation, wouldn't want such projects."
"How do you imagine to make marketing with a collective of musicians where there was no more ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal recognized that Les Dissonaces represented "a lux", indicating that no one of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the assembly, a leader has not been shown to be a piece in the musical act: "In a curious way that we can sing a more complex repertorium, as it seems simpler, because all musicians are obligated to be present in operation and not only in role," Grimal supports, while as in the Sunday spectacle "I was 74 diary on the scene."
In the opinion of Grimal, the Enescu Festival is a "courageous gate", the topic for which he invited and Les Dissonances: "A extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world are present and three times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited this strange group."
In a temple of the tradition of the orchestral, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something that spreads bariers.
Speaking about Enescu's operation, the violonist recognized as romanian music feelings of the Roman composer, so he did not need a special deal when he introduced Enescu works in the repository or.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinct, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Roman music, "for there was a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal military for the change in the way classic music education is made, considering "the media of music, as it is organized today, has a deadfruit" and "the music life represents the insect music."
We don't have to do the five-to-year trip if you don't serve anything.
At Bach's time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, launching albums, all are amazing, extraordinary, but so much as they are doing in music service.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it's no more freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave examples to Romanists before and posted access to the European Union: "In Romania, before you enter into the EU, you have wood and good meat."
In order to enter into the EU, health laws should have been adopted which are not good for wood and meat.
Production and agriculture come to the supermarket service, as is happening in France.
The music happens the same thing, it's the same logic.
The Dissonances make the Russian may not be too beautiful, but then when the tears are true roses.
In a ideal world, this music should return to the center and that institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be introduced, and this can be started with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese - that the western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we renew his education to school, we re-transfer the concerts to television and by this education we wouldn't need to sell musical subproducts," Gremal believes.
With that, there are things in the classic music education that raman very communists, that above all, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician that will sing to a tool, being before all musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's with everything else.
After your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?", asked the French artist Zambind.
Grimal seems that, for artists, a different way of doing music comes from the extent of this "soldate" status, over what "You think they're their limits": "Music work in a certain moment that they're not soldiers, and therefore after concert they're going out."
David Grimal talked about the project or musical and his vision of music and artist in the "The Ideal Festival", a discussion with the public organized in the International George Enescu Festival of the Institute Aspen Romania.

You have a super-talent and spontan kid who loves the movies?
Give her the chance to get seen.

The City City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices, so we start an inedite campaign.
We want to find the voice possible and cause parents to write their children to our concurrence.

FedEx fees are mixed, I lose tax previews for 2016
FedEx declared the results for the last trimester, the library gigant, reducing the estimates of profit for the year as follows the lower request for transport services and the costs increased for its territory transport division.
Company also stated that it intended to employ about 55,000 sezonary employees for the feast period.
In the same period of the past year, FedEx announced that he would employ 50,000 seasonary workers for the festival.
The company's actions were decreased by about 2,5% in pre-market transaction, 45 minutes before the clopoceal clopote.
FedEx Corp. stated that it was expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the financial year that ends in the next month, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimation.
Analysers preconceived $10.84, according to an investigation conducted by FactSet.
The estimation in decreasing the price growth of 4,9% in the average, with the entry into force on 4 January and higher overtakes for the transport of large or big packages, which will be applied in November.
The company stated that it was still expected to increase winning over the previous year as a result of reduction of costs, larger incomes and the development of online trade.
The President and Director-General Fredith stated that “the term is confronted with a significant economic activity as weaker than it is preconceived, in particular with regard to the production and global trade”.
Employment plans on the feast period were announced on one day after the UPS competitor stated that he intended to engage 90,000-95.000 additional employees, respectively the same number of employees that he made last year.
In the trimestre that ended on 31 August, FedEx won 692 million dollars, with 6% more than the year.
The payments per action were $2,42, under average estimation of $2,44 per action made by 12 analyzers who responded to Zacks Investment Research investigation.
The benefit increased by 5%, for 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analyzers who participated in Zacks investigation estimated the amount of $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been punished in recent years from a decline in international priority transport, which led to the stagnation of incomes registered by its Express unit.
However, the explosion in online purchases has lost the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last trimestress, land division incomes increased by 29%, but operational incomes have been practical because of larger costs for large packages and self-assurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in income due to larger basic tariffs, while the incomes registered by the freight division were decreased due to growing costs.
At the pre-market transaction, with at least a hour before the discovery sound, FedEx actions below with $3,85 or $2,5%, at $ 150.15.
Thursdays with 11% at year level and 17% towards the maximum record record recorded on 11 June.
With the most expected meeting of the last years, the developing policies in the Federal Reserve will last two days this week around a 27-year-old Honduran mahon table to decide whether the time is coming to increase a key rate of profit for the first time almost a decade.
From them, at the end of the central bank's meeting room, a wall picture of the United States will be spread.
The Charter is intended to remember that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation more presumed than anything.
The Central Bank received a double task from the Congress: maximize the rate of employment in the United States and maintain price stability.
However, since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders confirmed that there was a third unscriptural task: financial stability.
And this third task may be factor X in a too district decision of anticipate, which will be an announcement of March, and which will determine whether the United States is prepared to be distorted by the stimulant without a short-term delayed by nearly 0 in force from the end of 2008.
Even if most of the data indicates a strong growth economy, the recent agitization of global financial markets could expect Fed officers already cared about adding volatility by increased reference rate to federal funds - even with a percentage point sfert.
"Obviously, the pia job and inflation will be the first and main aspects they will follow," Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economicist of the brokery firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if those would seek a excuse to not increase the rate of profits, the uncertainty increasing on the world market is sufficient to offer them arguments to wait," it stated.
There is no consciousness regarding the decision that Fed will take, self-instabilised on the financial market.
A half of the recently questioned economys of Bloomberg have preceded a growth of the profit rate this week.
However, the financial markets are expected to reduce Fed, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decrease on the board if Fed increases the rate of profits, except where those developing politics would attempt to slipper by promiseing that it would pass a long time for the next growth.
March, the industrial media Dow Jones followed 228,89 points, or 1,4%, p. 16.599,85.
The advance was discovered by the challenges that the decision factors of Fed will maintain the rate of the stability benefits this week, declared John Lonski, the Economyist of Moody's capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising that Fed would grow the rates at this point," said Lonski.
If Fed's decision factors would do this, "they should act in profusion in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets."
Other experts declared that a growth of the profit rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty related to the time when Fed will act.
Only a month ago, Fed seemed to be on the way to increase the rate of 0.25% this month, the first small step to the slow opposite of the currency that would confirm the US recovery.
Yellen first and at the beginning of the greenhouse stated that it was expected to increase the rate of this year, despite the raising of liberal objects, such as the need for more economic progress.
Although the creation of jobs stopped in August, the growth of the work market was solid this year.
The rate of the rate was reduced to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and nearly the level considered by Fed as a total occupation of work force.
Salarial payments have shown adult signs.
And although the inflation continued not to reach the annual objective of the central bank, the Fed decision factors have concluded that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices found in brush decrease.
The economy “should be greater and need them, being the pressure on the market of work,” said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economicist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the worldwide financial markets began to enter into fibrilates at the end of this month, after China devaluated its currency.
The industrial media Dow Jones reduced by 16% under the maximum record reached in more, because investors feared that the Chinese economy stops the world growth.
Pia's recruited this month, Dow indexs are now about 10% under the maximum of May.
For the Fed decision factors, the market agitization is addressed to the complex calculation of the growth time of the profit rate.
"Doing what has been placed on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last weeks, would be more closer in the meeting," Stephen D. Ole, researcher experienced in UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was official Fed.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
“There is very much uncertainty related to the impact of the US economy and almost that they have no data to be based on later in China” said Ol.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of Fed, so practice should not be taken into account in making decisions.
However, in fact, Fed became a worldwide monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank was big.
Single allusion of the President, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could "inquire" his monetary expansion has declined on the world markets.
A world in which markets and economy are acquired of more, it is expected that Fed officers not only monitor the progress recorded in other areas but also consult other central banks and experts to interpret the world better.
His decisional process is “more art than science”, Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department in the Envestnet Inc Management Company.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., stated this month that “Fed has the same reaction to the changes of the financial market that seem to have no economic bases.”
Lacker, a member of the Federal Commission for the Dismissed Pia, has offered a decision-making body, which has supported the increase in the profit rate, as example of decisions of 1998-99.
A financial crisis affected Asia decided Fed to reduce the reference rate of 0.75% in three meetings, “in despite the possibility of limited identification for the US decisive”, Lacker stated.
A year later, the officers of Fed returned to those decrees.
Fed should first put the problem of financial stability only in the case of a major crisis, such as the market breakdown in 2008, stated Adam S. Posen, was a member of the Bank of England, the Commission for the establishment of the profit rate.
The last aggregated period does not rise either far from that level, it did.
"I think we don't want to get into the fear of an increase in the rate of profit because the markets have been overtaken," said the President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to hold the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, when something is changed in this regard, I don't think it should take pre-relevant measures.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the investigations, despite the trials of those from the Nine Channel to translate in Today Show on the change of partial leadership
The urgent movement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to translate on the subject of changes from the leading of the liberal party has not brought a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The Nine Channel's morning emission was transferred from the capital after Tony Abbott's breakdown in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competitive Sunrise emission, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was arrested in London as part of a series of transmissions in the course of a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cas · Niagara and Cancun.
This “cross” of the distance could not have too much account for the Aussie TV televisions, Sunrise had a audience of 397.000 televisions in the five capital cities, towards Today with 339.000.
Today recorded an easily growth compared to Monday audiences (317.000) and the past market (283.000) but the numbers were less than the last July (343.000).
Today has slightly differed against Sunrise in the last months.
In August, Today had a average audience of 318.000 and Sunrise of 33.000.
At the beginning of the year, differences between 400,000 and 500,000.
At the same time, in September, Sunrise has a average audience of 349.000 televisions and today 314.000.
That's the most interesting thing that's gone throughout the morning.
This morning, not only Parliament is affected by the current change!

They lost their lives after the police dropped in the protestants of Nepal
Fourth, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal after the police had taken a cross-group in the multitude that demonstrated against the new country's proposed constitution, a officer declared on Thursday.
Violences were produced on Thursday evening in the Rupandehi district, at approximately 280 km west of Kathmandu capital.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal's statements, the officer of the District Police, over 1,000 protestants were gathered before a police section, and some of them were cut down with stones and molots.
Mr. Dhakal believed that the police forces used lacrimogen gas after which they dropped fires into the air before they resorted to the use of cow-shirts.
After these words, twenty police officers and five civilians were hurt.
It wasn't clear that the bullets, about which it is known that they can kill, but they are usually used as less lower alternative, caused so many deaths.

Protests also exist in the west of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants his own state.

Weight reduction surgery may be useful for diabetes with easily obesity
The benefits of the weight reduction surgery in cases of easily obesity, with sugar diabetes type 2 may be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say if diabetes with easily obesity live more after chirurgical intervention of weight loss than those who follow non-hirurgical treatment.
"There is a long time to centralize the data on mortality," Dr. Robin Blackstone, specialist in the surgery of obesity, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, named and bariatric chirurgicals, use different methods to reduce the stomach.
This reduces the famine feeling and limits the body’s efficiency to absorb food.
For years, bariatric chirurgy has been demonstrated in the treatment of diabetes of type 2, but most studies have been discovered with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or above.
IMC, a weight measure unit in relation to the height, is considered normal within 18.5-24.9.
The IMC value of at least 25 indicates the fact that an ana is superior and the IMC with more than 30 is considered ob*.
You can calculate the IMC by: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Spital in Taiwan used the gathered data after 2007 in a trial where two types of bariatric chirurgie - bypass gastric and gastroectomy in manchon - in the medical treatment of the diabetes of type 2 to easily obesity.
The average IMC at the areas of surgery has been reduced from 31 to 24,5 pounds at the end of the fifth year during the study.
In time, IMCs who received non-hirurgical treatment against diabetes remained almost at the same level, and 29.
Among those who suffered chirurgical intervention, the diabetes were totally healed at 36% and partly at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, the diabetes was completely healed at only 1% and partly to only 2% of the subjects.
Moreover, the control of the blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL "grew" cholesterol " were generally better in the chirurgical group", concluded the authors.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of A1c hemoglobin, which reflects the level of glycaemia at times.
Researchers write that the optimal level of A1c hemoglobin is under 7%.
After chirurgical intervention, the average level of A1c hemoglobin was decreased from 9% to 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it was added to approximately 8%.
However, this “glycemic control” - reflected by the common levels of the A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce mortality rates to five years, according to the researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of chirurgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with gastroectomy in manchon, the chirurgical bypass intervention group lost more weight (18.7 towards 14.2 kg), recorded more significant reductions of IMC (7.4 towards 5.1) and A1c hemoglobin (3.1% towards 2.5.1%) and showed a higher probability of total sugar diabetes remission (46.9% to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or chirurgie after five years, there are evidence in a study conducted by a major weight in Sweden that the chirurgical intervention extends life, the Blackstone, from the University of Arjdena, the Medical Faculty - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, ob · ob · who have suffered barriary chirurgical intervention have presented a probability of at least 29% less to die after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit from survival in patients who had suffered chirurgical intervention, Blackstone was a optimistic aspect of the IMCs under 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is the point in which this work is critical, because it deems that this chirurgical intervention is safe in the low IMC group”, without increase in the risk of death or renal disease, it refers to.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously then the patient's IMC reaches at 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too much for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think when they collected these genetic illnesses that short-circled their body by predicting them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to return to normal.
“It is impossible to everyone come to Europe” - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all reactions, stated Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution for the current crisis of repeat is located in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader Buddhist sent a call to end violence in the lands of the rehabees.
Dalai Lama talked about the current crisis of re-reacting in the discourse that he held at the decline of the Centre Dalai Lama for Compaison in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies at the beginning of his 10-day visit in the British Sea.
He concluded that in the present time, human interests should be overcome in the interests of each nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, despite amazing, the response to the western European countries to the reaction crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible that everyone come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to face the crisis, he highlighted the fact that it was just a temporary solution.
"It's a wonderful care for a few thousand repeat, but we have to think at the same time on long-term solutions to bring up sincere peace and decency, especially through education, in muslim countries," he highlighted.
In the fond, we need to think about how to reduce crimes in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
For face never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after terrorist attacks on 11 September, showing that the violence response from the United States generated an incontrolable band of events.
After the events of September 11, I sent condolences to a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without calling on violence.
I know that his reasons were strong but he used for and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.

According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Anti-opening Centre, the cases of the hand detergent to children under 12 years reported to the anti-opening centres were from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
“The children are more frequent to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them come to the emergency room,” said Lopez for CNN.
Lopez said that some kids were intended to drink detergently and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube can be followed by films presented to adolescents how they drink detergent to create efficient flowers.
Youths seem to have mixed the detergente with gum water with alcohol to get a stronger bathroom.
Small kids can be drawn from the attractive mirror of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think he does bad," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (detergent of hands) are the perfume.
The detergents of hands with aroma of heads, struggle, portfolio are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains relatively 45-95% alcohol.
In particular in small children, just a few kids can cause alcohol disorder.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-opening centre in Kansas University Spital for Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a whiskey whiskey pair on the table, but people let those detergents of hands in possible places and if the small ones come to them, this is a quick way to consume much alcohol.
Nhaiyah, a girl of six years ago who recently entered the school equivalent of four pulverizations with aroma-headed hands, came to the emergency room to get treatment.
He had alcohol 179, two times greater than the grass to which a adult is considered by the law under the influenza of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor in the emergency room that treated it at the Medical Gwinnett Centre outside Atlanta.
Nhaiyah was stuck and couldn't go when he came to the emergency room.
The doctors monitored her over night in a hospital of children separate to identify the signs of brain lesions, because the girl fell down and shot to the head because of the alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was incredible," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaiyah's mother, for CNN.
It could be fatal.
Lopez recommended the parents and teachers to use mild products or services without alcohol and to not leave the hand detergent at the hands of children.
On the sea with alcohol, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after detergent hands that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained metal, a lithium, and not alcohol ethyl, specified as active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the north of New York complained to overcome their "great" teacher by putting anti-bacteria products in class, according to a police report.
Professor's very allergic at hand detergent and prohibited him in his course room.
The police believed that the plan was "insignificant" and has enhanced the disciplinary problem of the school inspector.

Because they're not the Rangers in there.
Here, it's not just about the return of the Rangers.
It's about the Old Company.
It's talking about both laol teams and there's the interest.
The pressure is big in the meals of the Old Company and not just the Scotchers want to see these mechanisms.

But Deila said, "Celtic had a period before and they would return."
We want to get out of this operation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely furious or tristly linked to what it seems.
Likewise, we - but we have to go further.
We have not seemed to have to need the exhibition of the Celtics because the players also become better.
It's extremely important to be united now.
Warburton's Pruden on the transfers of January
Despite recent comments only a few weeks that suggested that some objectives were identified for the transfers of January, the boss of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is identified when transfers are about, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox team unit.
The Boss of Brentford stated: "The period of transfers from January is very different from the one in the field."
In the case of the players transfered to the boat, there is a period before the season you could be integrated, what you could have observed in this season in our group.
The team works very well.
Sometimes you do bader if you bring players that are not necessary.

Griffiths swore to avoid Tynecastle
The Invisible Hibee was taken on the road after he repeated that he sang a song with offensive verses about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014, in a pub in the region Roseburn in Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.

The rate of the shooting in Scotland is unsubscribed while in the Great Britain grows
RATA SOMAJUL in Scotia, which was 164.000 in July, while the number of British seams totally increased by 10,000, reaching 1,82 million in the same period.
The estimate rate of 5.9% in Scotia was greater than the British Sea, 5.5%, in accordance with the numbers presented by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
During the time, the rate of employment in Scotland was decreased by 12.000 during three months, the number of employees currently to 2.612.000.
The rate of employment in Scotia has been reduced to 74.0% in the respective trimestre - a number over the average of .5 of the British Sea.
The Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the last numbers, said: “The long-term authorities' plan has set the bases of a stronger economy.”
It was almost a year since Scotland took historical decision to participate in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, I observed the workshops in Scotland, the rate of employment by recording growth and rate of decrease.
Why I am witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In this day, except a later legal intervention, I will see how a man is condemned to death.
If it takes place, and I hope that it doesn't work, I'll stand in a heat for observers in the Oclahoma State Penitenciar and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed by the administration of the local injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January through his best friend, and although I was shot, I accepted.
As soon as the day approaches, I'm scared of the idea.
So why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell all the story of capital penalty.
They'd offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses at the execution in America, and because the requests usually delay the number of places, there is a macabra lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of reserved places to representatives from 12 to five.
The elections will look at the execution of impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd stay at the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and I've also deceived my own time with him for the months of telephone conversation and a visit that was two hours ago.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The penitential authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to have a booklet and a pix to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all my details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me to Twitter that I commit my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the poet of the debt as he wants it, get it.
I was crying about her.
He repeated that “he could better form”, but it is still saying that I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I told and wrote to them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if she asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
However, he wants to present an internal report to write about the subject.
He thinks, if he dies, publicity will help the move against the capital penalty.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find more about the case, you have a series of multimedia files I've done.
I'm not gonna come back here all the details.
I can't sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complication.
But I think it's very probably not guilty of crime.
I'm sure there haven't been enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll see him died from this perspective.
I can't suppose I'm totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out how it's to look at a man who likes to die unusual.
Peter Moody suggests that the stewards tried to spion him and threatened to turn away from the course.
Peter Moody believed that Racing Victoria stewards or tried to infiltrate a spion into his grades last year and threatened that he was immediately going away from the course.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the Department of Integrity of Racing Victoria, showing that those dealing with a personal campaign against her, the picking that filled the cup with the elimination of Lady Tatai from the course because of a treatment administrated on the course day.
Moody stated for Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is better for the course area and that it was placed in a difficulty when it comes to the positive result of the leader's cobalt test, for which he does not have a explaining.
In 18 months, his words relating to spices statements were cut and didn't want to seem to “the wolf that doesn't come to struggles”.
"I wasn't going to say anything related to that aspect, and I was quiet a long time but sometimes you reached a level of frustration so high that everything was once confusing," said Moody.
It knows he's continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to submit the consciousness, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and I'll sleep quiet.
I'm going up with my head and I want the owners with whom I'm working to see that you're trying to offer them everything better.
From the time they began to believe that it doesn't look like that, I have to leave the trainer.
At that moment, I'll have to think what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Previously, Moody cut the bomb into a interview given for racing.com, where he stated that the department of integrity tried to spion the grass.
"After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were in a boat with a boy whose name I will tell him if I was asked - and were offered to join him to my grades to provide information about the activities there," said Moody for Racing.com.
Obviously, he's thinking about me a trigger.
If so, then everyone should give his demission because they were incapable of trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, President of the RVL, David Moodie, current President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current Executive Director of the RVL, knew at the present and I know and today.
Should I think it's a personal thing?
Is it necessary that RVL begins to have a vertebral column and can travel to the response outside the trainers for what is in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence of the industry?
So stupid is my industry's influence?
Maybe I see the others like that.
Maybe you have to take my license and give me a part and I don't doubt that the statements I'm doing now might decide to think about this variant.
But I've come to the point where I don't care about it, and that's a triumph.
It's very hard to disappoint me.
I'll press and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
The trainer's frustration increased once with the investigation on the cobalt test in which the leaders were involved and the elimination decided to show that it could "lay their licence on the table".
Moody, whose name is the most commonly associated with the introduction of the unwins Black Caviar campaign, labeled the treatment regulation on the course day as a "ridicule" after the horses were applied to a cataplasm with namole or arguilla, which covers the rules.
Remember the course rules.
I have to take my wholesome care of this," he says.
One of my employees put it out of a mistake.
It could have been last night.
It could be yesterday, what it was.
He's got up on the day of the course.
Moody could have disqualified three months for the treatment of the course day, consisting in the application of the cataplasm, for which the stewars have discovered an investigation.
It's a shit.
People who do these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that the rules are needed but he went too far," Moody said.
The boss who struck and fled from the accident site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a boy after a collision with a bicyclist produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by the flight from the accident.
The bicyclist was transported with the helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, being severely hurt after he was shot on the morning by a car on the Murray Valley Street.
The police response states that the car driver did not stop to help the wounded bicyclist.
Monday, a 50-year-old boy, has been delivered to the police in Shepparton.
It seems that it will be accused of escape from the accident site, the defeat of the first assistant and other route crimes.
The bicyclist, a 40-year-old boy, from Cobram, internally, in stable state.
Antrenor Melbourne Storm, âig Bellamy, answers the opposers in wrestling accusations.
Antrenor Melbourne Storm, Jyig Bellamy, called the critics used by his team's placing tactics as "denaturated subjects" in discussion with the main two favorites in the NRL.
Antr. Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, stated that the artists allowed Storm players to "take them on the trail" team to win Storm nervous ones at the end of calibration played last night in Sydney.
The leader of those from Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made a easy reference to Storm after his team winning with North Queensland Cowboys, played Sunday night, when he called the mechanism a "demonstration" of the rugby leg and declared that the two teams in Queensland were not too designed to wrestling.
Bellamy seemed to look at the placing tactic of his team and declared that players simply focused on "contact" when they liked.
Bellamy says she had confidence after two important trainers criticized her team, which means that they were worried that Storm would win.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson crying when we were baptized with score 24-2," said Bellamy Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all the year in our defensive systems or techniques, so only in the last six weeks I have actually put the accent on contacts in places and so we have changed the operation.
Trent is in this function for three years and evidently has a wonderful team so that it is probably not usual to lose and it was a shock for him.
We know how it is always in this year's period.
Bellamy contraryed Bennett's idea to "the soul" by reminding his mentor of St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett's win the campion in 2010 by playing the "plecticist" ball.
Wayne's talking about a palpitant ball.
And he argumented his appearance comparing his summer game tonight with our dinner game tonight and talking about how colpitant it was the game," Bellammy.
I remember that, in 2010, St George received many critics because it was a flat team and Wayne said he was not interested in him as black under anguish.
But now he's got a team that can play what we're thinking as a palpitant, especially because of young rapiders.
That kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his game style - not any team has two ways like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play so.
I'm more confident that they're doing these things because they're sometimes concerned about the mech with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they thought about the important mechanisms.
Bellamy also showed that the mechanism between Storm and Roosters was a more urgent interruption related to the mechanism between Broncos and Cowboys.
The boy of Broncos was probably a good guy, I haven't seen him yet, how was the score? 16-12?
Our boy's finished 20-18, in our game there were two more trials, that means a painting game?
Or do you want to pause and don't walk?
It's plans for me.
If I'm talking about us, it means that at a moment we could meet them.
Storm has free this weekend because they won the right to play home or with North Queensland Cowboys, or with Cronulla Sharks, at the end of the weekend preliminars, at AAMI Park, the pictures set up in sale by the start of the you march, tomorrow.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to join pedofils to send pictures.
A pedofil used a 11-year girl's phone to ask the images of the kids.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept then was authenticated in a online mailing service where another user sent him a series of unexpected images having children as subject.
The girl wake up later and observed the phone disappearance that he found in Hogg's hand while he slept.
He looked at the phone and found the crazy messages after Mom was warned immediately.
After arrival, the police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at that address and found "inquired" searches on the Internet using terms to find inconsistent images with children's subjects.
Hogg claimed that he had done it to "attract pedofils" on the Internet before he said he was a policeman to fear them."
Professor Eilidh Robertson stated about Dundee’s instance: “He said it is a deceit - it is to fear people.
He repeated that he made the searches on the computer but he said he did it because he wanted to be a police officer to fear the pedofils.
He was asked about the conversations that were conducted with us who sent his pictures and the fact that he asked her to send more and more photos.
He said he did it to breathe.
He said he wasn't thinking clearer when he drinked and wanted to see pictures of violations and crimes.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she cried out her mother and her fear and wept.
The girls saw the incredible pictures on the phone and the accusation was overthrown.
girls were interviewed and told that the accusation used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who were much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, at age 23, homelied in Ward Road, Dundee, committed the accusations that he made or made an inconsistent photos with children, and distorted the issues of release on 25 January this year and did not appear before the 24 March of the current year.
The opinion lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked Hogg not to be recorded in the register of sexual criminals because it could be considered that this crime “not involved a significant sexual aspect”.
Judge Alistair Carmichael sentence in October, for the reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on caution in this folder but remained preserved before other folders.
It was passed in the register of sexual criminals before it was given sense.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Zimbabwe Republic, sent the wrong talk to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
It wasn't hurt, however, the filming of cadding became viral on socialization networks.
The disruption of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by representatives of a position that would have received anonymous threats to death, threatening him that he would never be attracted to Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was cut off during his parliamentary speech - the speech that he repeated on Tuesday.
The Chairman of Parliamental Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, stated that seven politicians in a position received text on mobile phones, warned not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is named "Death", he told the journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the parliamentaries because the immunity applies only in Parliament and when it appears to Parliament, the parliamentary immunity is no longer valuable.
The Chairman of the Parliamentary Group stated that the party, carried out by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "inquired" concerning the threats to the political.
Hewlett-Packard is going to make 30,000 decreases.
Hewlett-Packard will make between 25.000 and 30.000 advances as part of the efforts of the enterprise to reduce costs in the services sector.

FriendsFest: the comic series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
AbsenProperty of similar persons in the series is evident, taking into account that the need for boys to disappear is now more desperate than ever, the rate of suicide in the youths at the end of the past 15 years.
In 2013, the suicide represented the main cause of death in age of 20-45 in the British Sea, and three times more often for men than for women.
In trying to cope with the problem, Campania against unfortunate life (Campagn Against Living Miserably (CALM) designed 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to put a sign of the cultural question that prevents the men to ask assistance when they need.
The pleasure is in the center of the light to the success of this challenge.
A recent study from more than 2000 school students presenting depression symptoms concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with healthy displacement”, its chances of recovery are doubled.
In the same way, for non-depressed clusters, a circle of mental healthy friends reduces the prospect of appearance of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have effect, this must first be possible.
In this time of communication dominated by social networks, where the accent is set on the style and not on the substance, the immediate character of the response is often priority before signing contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create appears to a powerful personality, dismissed to action and success, even if the isolation is actually the dominant.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychology calls external values; money, imagination, social status, all with the cost of the intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal deception and friendship - which also deeply affects our mental health.
The billion inventory of a video game recently explained that money doesn't even buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends' series was that he directed the attention of this idea.
Personals were not defined by the workplace, but by the personality of their own persons, which they used to interact as friends.
Homother of Joey and Chandler's frequent breeding, the moments in which he looks at in the comfortable photos and the passion of Ross for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can be associated with this action, even if they often are able to explore their feelings completely.
As a social worker explained to me, "My role in self-sufficiency and depressed trends has made it like the smallest interactions with friends can be different."
Instead, those calling to us are not able to talk to friends.
The old man's trying to take yourself alone is strong, as well as the feeling of being understood as a weak man if you're talking desperately about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to me when I'm trying to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms long-term.
The series has shown the little time of friendship between boys.
As long as the objective, external intervention, through the phone, helped people at the time of discouragement, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
So if you participate in this weekend in FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with complete playing of film payments to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a café in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, you smile and salute.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is distributed by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all the 236 episodes - with the opportunity #FriendsFest
Di Maria walks and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after he marched against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria marked Tuesday in his debt meal in the Campions Liga and helped the PSG to put it in front of the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present you the cronica of the mechanic and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have made their debt, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of mechases from the Ligia Campions groups, with a 2-0 calm victory against Malmo in the mice played Thursday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria marked at least four minutes from the beginning of his debt meal in Liga Campioners in PSG team, bringing the French campions in advantage, although they rated a series of occasions before they assured their advantage by Cavani in the 61th minute.
By reaching the Group A close to Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetzk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish campions because the aim of the franc team is not just the qualification in optimal but also the collection of the course to the final sports in each of the last three tours.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Bla's students were far away from a perfect table, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who iroised the white opportunity after which he was replaced by the team of his native city and the club at which he started his carrier in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or move to Campions Liga, so the victory with 2-0 creates problems to our opposers and establishs a comfortable difference against the following classified, even if there are more aspects that we need to perfection throughout the season," says BlaStyle.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I'm sorry we couldn't give one or two more.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes in the team in Paris, with a 2-2 remission obtained from Bordeaux in Liga 1 in the weekend, but Di Maria took the reflectors in four minutes.
Last month when he was transferred by Manchester United, the argentinian offensive middle was called the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and showed this when he was cast into the past of Marco Verratti behind Malmo's appearance before he looked incredible over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the gate.
But if someone expects PSG to get the victory from the fingers, they have been disappointed.
Malmo, who wined Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the territory with nine titlers to national teams, with a appearance of five people and two middle defensives, was a strong opposer.
But their attack was not impressive, by making Nikola Djurdjic's shot that passed by Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players stopped the ritm several times, giveing a few steps unusual and unfinished interventions, even Ibrahimovic who rated not less than five tests only in the first reprise and then was replaced by Cavani even after the game renamed.
Ibrahimimovic, however, showed much more understanding in supporting her colleagues, his pass by being the one that Di Maria sent in a suit that was raised by Wiland over the gate in 52 minutes.
The second white was recorded in a final after a hour of the meals, because of Cavani, the Uruguayan who wrote the sixth empty season after Ibrahimovic passed from the center of Maxwell.
This white removed the hope of those from Malmo that they would reheal the score and only a super stop of Wiland from the distance for the refusal of David Luiz held the final score before the new income of Ezequiel Lavezzi was cancelled a white in the long term.
The Norwegian team leader in Malmo, Age Hareide, later said that PSG had a class over and that "The last meal we played in the Campions Liga was last year."
Since then, I just played in the liga in Sweden, which doesn't rise at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Bottom PSG.
They made a great game.

He also wishes to issue a device that prevents the extent of the obligation for all electrical providers to become mandataries of the SRTv for the collection of TV taxes by involveing ANNRE in the regulation of this activity.
In its opinion, a maximum of 5% of the income committee is required.
Stelian Tanase requests a reduction of the TVA cost for specific activities of the public television and contribution to CNC from 15% at level of 3%, as well as amendment of law 41/1994, in the meaning of the possibility of receiving budget/financing for the purchasing of licence for major cultural and sports events - The World Campionat of Fotbal, Gold Cerbul, Eurovision.
He submits that SRTv will enter into the incapacity of payment in the following months as the employment legislation requires the employer to implement the execution of judges, even if they are not definitive, and the payment rights are respected with priority to any other obligation.
The TVR has made constant efforts to reduce costs with the personal and TV production.
"So the movements and other cost generating activities have been reduced, a series of commercial contracts have been re negotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post has been closed," it appeared in the letter of the President of TVR.
The fact that the destructive financiality cannot be immediately by its own effort.
"For the exhibition of State institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian television will be, before or later, in the ability to uncomplete its public mission," it was mentioned in letters.
The conduct of the Camera to the Members decided to send the letter to the Cultural Commission.

Pont, accused of uncontrolled calamities and irrational disorders
The Minister for External Affairs Peter Szijjarto condemned hard, midnight tomorrow, the premium Victor Ponta in accordance with the political decision cars in Hungary are "with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other taxes from which the rehabaties flee."
"Yesterday Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through its irrational performances, the Hungary's interests," transmitted the Hungarian minister from the External Ministry into a communication.
European civilized politicians do not say that of uncontrolled calamities.
"Their comments have only one explanation: he has lost its total exercise in the internal policy in Romania," he advised the leader of the Hungarian diplomacy according to MTI.
On Tuesday evening on Facebook, Prime Victor Ponta wanted to take care of and sanctify the behavior of higher officials of exhibition, which, in his opinion, "I'm a Russian for culture and values of the European Union."
I don't want to respond to the challenges coming from exhibitional representatives.
"This is a russian for the culture and values of the European Union; and in antisemit attitudes, and in relation to the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the crisis of reactions!", Ponta on Facebook stated.
The Roman Prime Minister recognized that it is the adoption of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of reaction crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve a problem.
The gympate army, aggressive laws, prisoners and brutality will not solve the problem - they will only appear that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decisions with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or others who flee from!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, especially above European values - which we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!", highlighted the chair of the Roman executive.
Previous March, Minister of Foreign Hungarian, Peter Szijjarto, qualified as "single lies" comments of the Roman Prime Victor Ponta on the management of the Hungarian crisis of rehabates, appreciating that these things are inadequate for a leader of the 20th century, according to MTI.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy mentioned the "extremist and lying marks" of the Roman Prime Minister's internal political crisis in Romania and expressed as Budapest waited for excuses from Romania.
Szijjarto refers to a statement made on Monday of the first Victor Ponta.
What I said and I've always said is that I'm opposed to xenophobe talks the idea of closing the borders, like everyone who comes is some terrorists, they're stupid by the Medium Evul and I'm totally opposed to this border.
If we can get more, we'll get it, the problem is our logisticity to treat those people as some people, not how they treat our exhibitors, with battle and with the insertion.
"So I'm not agreed," he was the chair of the Roman executive, in a press conference at Targu-Jiu.
Thursday, Peter Szijjarto announced that Budapest's Government decided to start the preparations in the territory for the extent to the border with Romania of the garden he built at the border with Serbia, to make the girl of a possible change of the road used by guardians.

How Hagi closed the mouth of the answers
As regards many worlds, the biggest romanbalist in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after the retraction of the activity, as a weak entrener, which cannot be able to perform perfectly and in the new position.
After unfortunate experiences in the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took, after a year, the role of an entrenor to the future of Constanta, the team that he patterned.
After fixing a year from the reception of the team, the King showed that it was able to transform a team that was running to save backwards into a top.
So, after a year, the future recorded, with Hagi, 16 winners, 11 puzzles and 11 infrastructures.
The bilant is one of a top team, which fights to the European cow.
The things took a better tour for the future in this season, entered the team reached two in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in Liga 1, with 20 goals (the equality with Astra), more than double than Steaua.
On the other hand, even if he brought to the team more experimented players, Hagi continued the policy to promote young people, and in the last time in the start team they appeared names like Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The Club Policy has made in the future a team for foreign teams, so Hagi has sold in this billion of EUR 1.5 million - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euro) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 billion euros).
Alatures de Steaua, the future is the only profitable team in Liga 1, according to the data from the Comercial Register.
In the crisis of the reactions, Romania has already played as a little bit.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask you to be treated as the seventh end of the EU.
Great tariffs come with solutions for the EU, Christian Ghinea, member of the Directorate of the European European Policy Centre.
In an interview granted by Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea seemed that Europe cannot be transformed into a strengthening, and the mediums of politicians will not work in this crisis: "We may have a doubt about the quality girl of the values with which these people come."
But there are masss that started and we can't return the story.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as well and adapt them to us.
In Christian Ghinea's opinion, we find us in a extremely emotional moment, where politicians feel needed to show their muscles.
After he's gone, the Europeans will not be willing to reject freedom, but the rules in Schengen space must be changed: "Schangen is now as a animal created in the other time and which has not been adapted to the deal of now."
Where are we in the crisis of the reactions after this JAI that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the EC presidents in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to strengthen a vote in ́u.
All the pronostics said that it had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of uniformity is applied in JAI and any State may block any decision.
Therefore, things have been very smallly integrated in the area of justice and internal activities.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the CE has initiatives, is applied, and the vote of 55% between States, namely 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes exist.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because there is a question of the matter, the refusal reactions have appeared even in Germany against the cancellation policy of Merkel and they didn't want it to appear as a reaction of the type "EU sent us to our head."
They sought, but the problem is that this vale, obviously, creates a big problem for the Schengen deputy, and we will probably assist great changes there in the next period.
So the obligatory costs weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to get back?
Yes, on the other hand, there is a greater involvement of the Frontex Agency in the management of external borders, which means a change in the individual level of members in Schengen's external border to Community agencies.
Greece's grant with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, in fact, and this valve of responsibility has given the terms of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be rejected, according to the currency it is the state in which it comes first, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is capoteate, you can't say infinitely that it's Greece's work.
The problem is common.
Because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a precise mechanism, perhaps actually mandatory, to provide the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the obligatory cubits will work, if they get to them.
Because there's a problem: what are you doing with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will be taken up on the top: you're going to the X or Y.
It will probably reach some unique filter centres, in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum requests are disappointed.
It's working on the solutions of this kind.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
I'm strong who have ten years of experience in trying to integrate, they are strong without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will reduce the current xenofob.
Of course, we talk about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in preservation cabs and who just started to go to Europe.
A estimation says that only 10 percent have gone, the air is hard for the Mediterranean past, but we're waiting for the next year to a valley may even be bigger.
What are we doing with these people?
My pronostic is that we're going to make this problem usually, we're not going to look at it so much as the median.
You're talking about a little or greater experience.
Do you think there's a place where it has actually achieved the integration of large groups coming into a foreign European culture?
Look at the magrebies in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still inclaimed.
I'm not going to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficulty than in other values, but that doesn't mean that it's no longer integrated.
It took up an inintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But the middle of the police will not work.
Let's create Europe's strength and illusion.
It must go to the mechanisms of integration in the European society.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more prominent.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to raise any more with a pearl in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through the conventional marriages.
However, it must separate the reasonable problem of these people on a long term of their integration.
If others have gone in the long-term integration, it doesn't mean we should look at them as they go into the Mediterranean.
Maybe we've got the double girl of the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there's an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, it doesn't mean that it's going to be back to the night and you can go back.
As soon as the solution comes, we see strengthened in Europe.
Granates have been closed, walls rise up, controls are returned to the border in Schengen.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project is not the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built enough to minimize the rules as long as the pressure was too large on the tables where I put the peak for the first time.
We were free from the hall, but everyone's with his problems.
It can't be like that, because some poor don't do the girl.
When there are such emotional values, politicians will appear to do something, but at a long time, it doesn't change a big thing.
After France's attention, we have no longer dramatic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than last year.
It's a valley of public emotion that is installed in both senses.
And it's so instable from one week to another until you can't make decisions based on her.
We have a lot of talks, many political statements found at home under pressure to be viral.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the child injected in Turkey and the public opinion feels emotionate.
After the public emotion, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement is not only for humans but also for goods.
This is a real European soldier.
And I don't think the Europeans will reject this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules, it's something else.
Schengen is now as an animal created in the other time and was not adapted to the current life.
How did Romania play before now in this crisis?
Like a little bit, who thinks, if he draws up his eyes and it's throwing up the ears, the theme disappears.
In contrast with the reality of the valves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it's not your very little problem.
That's what we've done, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask you to be treated for the seventh end of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at a big level.
Great taxes come with solutions for the EU's business, good or bad, we are not talking about their quality now.
Like Poland.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the aptitude of the Romans for Schengen will be very lost.
President Johannis says it might be good that I haven't come in.
So we're going from the hope of entering into a more pragmatic position, but the objective of the ramane.
There is certainly a risk if Romania and Bulgaria entered in Schengen as the ability to see us as the alternative path.
What doesn't mean is a reason to not go into Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but it will be transformed into the meaning that external borders will become common, will be unique rules for the acceptance of migrants, single export rules for those who do not receive asyl, single rules for safe tariffs.
The Ukrainian President said that after Russia moved Syria to Ukraine, no one died anymore.
Is there a connection between the second focus, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks to be a great power means to join Americans and Europeans.
From this point, yes, there's a relationship.
Take the military and financial effort of Putin regime, probably the Assad regime would have fallen down.
And it was nice to go down before the main or opposite to be the Islamic State.
About two years there was a fight between the regime of Assad and the lac and moderated muslims, supported by the Tarses of Golf and Western.
Then the Islamic State has risen up and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to go.
Russia could complicate things, but she couldn't participate in the solution.
It creates a focus of instability and haos that can't close.
But you're great power only if you have the solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to punish time.
Putin probably expected to make his offers, to put on the buttons to resolve.
The offers are not coming because the world is not convinced that he can solve in a way or other things create all of it.
But I don't agree with the theories that say these people are eaten by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than it's.
What the button will appear in the corner
Thousands of Facebook users have visited the "Like" button, and now the representative of the socialization network prepares another work, the "Dislike".
March, Mark Zuckerberg, co-funder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be at the meeting, report New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg suggested that the "Dislike" button will appear more deeply what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or he raised a problem that Facebook could become a smaller friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid the moments when someone puts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
The network users, which reached 1.5 billion active accounts, asked for a long time to have the possibility of expressing their negative emotions or empathy with something trist.
Mark Zuckerberg has already said it is not very comfortable that his people give "Like" current events, such as the crisis of the reactions, or in the case of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable to give Like that post," pointed Facebook representative.
The variance of a new button on Facebook has not been received well from everyone.
"There is already a lot of hatred on Facebook and on socialization networks," commented Atiq Haneef in Afghanistan on the Facebook page of New York Times, where the article was sent to this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, insisted that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have Facebook opinions.
Debra Aho Williamson, media social analysis to eMarketer company, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that one button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports, approaches the electoral campaign in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 repeateds entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted March only 70 men, a man of thousand incomes in the table at its south border with Serbia, announced the chairman Gyorgy Bakondi.
Hungary declared the emergency state during the second day in the second juice of the border with Serbia because of the re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-flow, enclosing a main point of crossing the border and claiming that you will build a guard at its border with Romania, remember DPA.
Masura sent a brushing reaction from Serbiai.
Yesterday they said they would sign the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to be azyl.
"As you see, this is totally stumbled," said the Serb Minister for Re-Re-Reservate, Alexander Vulin.
Before introducing the new immigration legislation, a number of 5.809 recipients entered Sunday into Hungary, the police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from Middle East and Africa have also passed in Hungary in Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid recording and trying to get in O', especially in Germany.
The New Council's Site of Judean is standing.
Two constructors, inconsistently
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, have been given because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here have entered into responsibility during work.
The Judecean Council Side on the Straight of Vasile Alecsandri will be able to give it alone.
In one and half year since the consolidation and refunding of the building work had been completed, the works did not reach half.
A last stage in the building period was consumed last days when the National Counsel for the Solution of Contes (CNSC) refused a claim of the company who wanted to take the technical project implementation contract for the works that are to be carried out.
The initial project was implemented by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the entry into responsibility of the builder and interruption of work, the negotiation procedures have been deteriorated without publishing a participation announcement with Impex Romcatel, which should update the technical project, and then organize a new licence for work.
"The consequences have not been concluded by a contract, CJ appreciating that the proposed form would have disvantaged the institution," Rezvan Timofciuc, represented public relations in the CJ.
The CJ decision to interrupt direct negotiations was attacked by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of Justice sent the cry to the CNSC, who rejected it as later.
This does not mean that CJ can start searching for another projector.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility of attacking the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, almost after a final sense of that, can be calculated to find another projector.
Thus, building consolidation works could be recovered in the next year.
Our intention is to start the work as soon as possible.
In principle, re-re-re-re-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-contract-contract-contracting should not be very difficult, but we must reach the end of a contract.
"We're expecting to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," said Timofocuc.
The consolidation work of the former seat of the Police Question began in 2011.
A first contract of work was resumed in April 2012, after works of 4,5 million lay.
The licence was revoked by the contract by MoldoConstruct SA.
However, the company entered into an insolvency, and this contract was resumed, after payment of 1,5 million league.
The works have been done now in proportion of about 50%.
Initial, consolidation, refunding and maintenance of fusher building, evaluated at 7.7 million league.

Aventure in the stone time
In the opinion of President FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can lead to a major handbalistic competition only in 2024, and preparing the woman's national handball to qualify for the Olympics Games costs a possession.
The President of the Roman Federation of Handbal, Alexandru Dedu, declared yesterday in a meeting with the press, that it is a great surprise that our staff has three teams in the Campions Library groups.
As regards the national female handbal team of Romania, "the main objective is the qualification of the Olympics Games from Rio, but this is why it needs to pass two stages of coudian furniture, first in the World Campionate and the second round the pre-called tour," Dedu said.
We want to be very strong to qualify for the Olympics Games.
There are no fantastic requirements from the technical staff conducted by Tomas Ryde.
A staff that will be compiled from seven or eight.
He wants second, doctor, two mass, ports, physical preparer, head of delegation.
They asked us to obtain the qualification of anything, more precise material for physical preparation, which I never heard.
It's all this to reach the Olympics Games, and I'll do everything he holds from me to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make perfection.
Because at the time of the face we're in the stone time with preparation.
"The teams with which we battle have these materials and have sometimes," Dedu said, who was trying to get the amounts necessary for the acquisition of these products from MTS and COSR.
The President FRH also refers to Romania's infrastructure and to the possibility that our chairmanships develop a major competition in handbal.
We don't have a room in Bucuresti.
It is a problem of infrastructure and is confused to be put under the sign of the question a European gimnastic campionate.
Let's not forget that in the other corners of the lumb were built entirely in two days.
Before 1992, in the current empire of Barcelona, there was a bullet of pumps, and now it has become a beautiful resort.
Similarly, in London, the Olimpiade organisation of 2012 was successful and in view of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can make a major competition," Dedu stated.
He added that the international handbal bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me, it's a priority to bring major handbal competitions in Romania.
Mr. Gatzu was civilized with a project, people gave their agreement in principle, but they were very quickly declared that the room would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we wanted, that we were able to organize, and they said they were agreed and invited to the first mech in the new room in București and then we talked concretely.
"So we have all the discovery, and the EHF and the IHF, but we have no infrastructure," explained the FRH officer.
The big handbalist avoided evaluating the possibilities of female teams CSM București and HCM Baia Grande to reach the Final Four: "I have requested all trainers to be reserved in proofs, that if they do not come back against them."
Good way to the World Cups
Roman Rugbists debut on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national team of rugby, Mihai Macovei, stated, March, in a press conference, that all the components of the Rooms lot are ready for the mechanisms of the World Cupa in England, where he hopes to get two winners: "We're ready."
So I and my colleagues are with the motors at the maximum time.
We trained us to give the best random in the four mechanisms.
Everyone will have great challenges, because our goal is to win in two ways, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are hard, and ours is the same.
Let's get it easily, first with Fran, and then we'll see.
However, if we win with Canada, the mechanism with Italy will be our end.
I can't describe in the words of the participation in the World Cups, it's the devotion of so many years of work.
I want not to disappoint anyone in the request family and come with beautiful results home.
"We want you to be surprised that no players, a small family like the rugby in Romania, representing the tremendous tricolor," said Macovei.
The elector of the Romanian National Team, Lynn Howells, found in the first experience as an entrenor in the World Cupa, hopes to make Romans the surprise of the rugby election: "It's a great honour for us to participate in this World County."
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tour.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me, it's very important for every mechanism to make Romans proud of the national team.

Jashe, made by RATP controllers and a flat.
A tourist's guardian
A tourist family from Cluj came to Iaşi to visit him, but the excursion ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither I nor my wife would never want to be in your town anymore.
He wants, they've been struck by the wrong information from the RAPT controllers, and, bonus, of the amendment "that the law says."
Women arrived in Iaşi a few days ago, caught in a hotel in the Centre and asked tourists.
They also received a plagan where the RATP travels passed.
"Stop" with these cards, men visited Iashul.
But two days later, they found in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because it wasn't tone with billets in the Lake Park Copou station, they were based on the printed information on the floor: that I can take the billet through SMS.
Nobody told them that this service doesn't exist anymore.
Trusts in the floor, they walked into a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the floor.
Unfortunately for them, he made his appearance a team of RATP controllers.
They said there wasn't the two-year service and it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
I'm going to know what happened in the local press, I'm coming with a night before I'm visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained their ability, they said it wasn't going to pass, it's not their job.
The attitude was very troubled.
They said that everything I can do is to give us one amend instead of 2 (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to strike my day of visit at Jandarmery and dand the statement there!", says Ovidiu.
Finally, the family was amended because of false information from the pillars and controllers that "the law was applied to blood".
It's not right, and I've made a session at the RATP Iasi to restore my money.
It's not about money, I'm not exagered by many, but the idea is that I felt insulted.
Ghinion for Vaslu violators.
They had an accident and remained in prevention arrest.
The process of the seven violators from Vaslui moved to the Court of Appel Iaşi yesterday.
The outdoor magicians judged the first time of juice in an unusual meeting where the seven young ones accused that they had baptized a 18-year-old tightening requested to be put into freedom.
Before the next time of the Judicial meeting, one of the Jews outside whose file, Viorel Monteanu, was shared, made a request for receipt, which was accepted by his colleagues from the instance.
The Magister activated this year to the Court of Justice, where the Chairman of the Section On Nale was the one who, on 9 April, accepted a contest formulated by four of the accused ones, with their position in arrest at home.
Currently, the document is judged by a complete part of the judges of Maricica Mititulu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the folder, the player Dan An ton has made a retention and a tone player, because his daughter is located in a connection with one of the violator advocates.
The two judges decided that Vaslu violators continue to be preventional arrested.
Your black ones will be prisoned for at least 30 days, when the triggers will resume the possibility of their freedom.
The following Juice term will be held at the Court of Appel Iaşi on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appel Iaşi, the dupe with which violators were transported from Vaslu was involved in an accident produced in the Pacurari Card, the car entered in Iaşi centuries.
Iveco's car usage with which the seven violators were transported shooted a Volks wagen autoturism that went out from Canta Street, and the driver tried to come to the left.
Duba was at the end of Pecurari.
The car entered in Iaşi because the employees of the Penitenciars prefered the way from Vaslu to Iassi on Grajduri, then on the centurion.
They quickly quicked the road with a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the score of arrests called another transport to take detentions.
Shortly, in the place of the accident, a car was sent from the Maxima Security Penitenciar Iaşi, who took the seven holders and transported them to the Court of Apel.
Following the accident, no one of the arrests was hurt.
To transfer it to the other double, the guards surrounded the back of the new mask, and the arrests went out fast, two and two.
"The incidence was not reported to the police because the drivers of the vehicles were able to understand about the taxes to be paid," Commissioner Medalin Ţaranu said in the IPJ.
Marine
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what he's going to follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and reflected: the 7000 repeats that Romania should and must naturalize, in themselves, represents an unsignificant, but great number in comparison with the ability of the Roman State to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by București, in about 1500 souls, we are very deeply dealing with the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in the last months.
However, if those will even accept to establish themselves in our places, the chances of quickly integrating them into the Roman society are greatly small.
I'm sure they'll be the first ones who will lose their patience.
Parasite of interlops and paralyzed by a venous political class, Roman state is demonstrated impotent in all areas.
Unfortunate to integrate the cigarettes is just a banal example.
On this hand, the colors of any European funds were not able to absorpte, make roads, gardens or schools, ensure a decent medical assistance, gather the mixture on the street, create honourable jobs or keep their own generation home.
Why would the reactions be established in a elsewhere from which they flee?
But what makes a lot of wonder is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We first strive from the powerful community of the EU's powerful states, which proves greater generosity when it is intended to share difficulties with smaller countries.
Then the fearful hypocrisy of the Romans who, although millions of roots are split around the world, do not accept the other - other languages, other religions, other blood.
It's probably afraid he doesn't steal any nation.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many people, who, although only calls for war wars as a reason for delay, does not accept any other destination of exhibition other than Germany or northern countries.
But not all reactions are Syrian, but there is no war in Pakistan.
Moreover, the simple way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be taken in disfellowship.
The cases need to be removed, supported by some, and, stretching on the political correction book, request peace and investment for the countries of origin.
But in Romania there's peace and even more in, since then, some foreign capital in nationality -- but that does not prevent ten thousand Romans to appear each year.
Why is he going?
In this crisis, the European Union has developed us as anxious, debated and delayed construction.
I claimed that Romania is not able to invent a draft plan, but it is that neither the EU has any future plan.
And improvizations and threats help nothing.
What, then, is the use of the EU, if the only advantage of the Romans - the right to freedom - could be discussed because of the rear-aged valleys that cross the borders as a burning?
At a moment, the Syrian war will end.
Not the crisis of the people.
In the next decades, overworking, poverty, climate change, evacuation of resources, etc., will emphasize millions of dispersed people, in Asia, especially in Africa, to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what it will follow.

EXCLUSIV: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years, he received a courageous gift: biological parentes
Lost in hospital in the nearly 90s, when he had only two months of life, little, sick and unhelpful, and then adopted by a stated family in Italy, in the same years in which the adoption was regulated, a big exhesion, now a blonde and beautiful girl, came back in Iasse with biological parentes in a city of the Jew, after nearly two decades in which no one knew anything about the other.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer their loved daughter a playing and courageous gift: a visit in Romania, in Iaşi, to know his unclean past.
"The Zear de Iaşi", who attended the efforts to search for the family of origin after a few extreme wave indexes, was a witness to these meetings which practically break your heart.
Reporting to reporters, emotions of the moments, the statements of the involved ones, their reactions are of movement and copleş.
Crine's story started 20 years ago in the outside place of Ruginosa, when he had only two months.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be interviewed in the hospital, in the city.
In the house they started to have unintelligences between parents, and Mom was needed to keep the house.
He decided to keep the girl, and she sent me from home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I didn't know anything.
"When I found that he was in the hospital, it was too late," she remembered her painful Alina, the biological mother of her girl.
Crina was interacted with her grandfather at the municipal hospital in Pashcani, and all then the father of the girl, Costica Balcan, went to work in Alexandria, Jewish Jewish.
Their lives had to be permanently separated.
They haven't found Crina anymore in the hospital.
After all, Crine's father went to work in another place, and returned after six months.
In time, the girl was transferred to Iaşi hospital, and the father, when he came back, didn't find her anymore.
I think she was almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I'll think she's abandoned," says a family's grandfather.
Because of financial problems, a grandmother couldn't come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one had been interested in the kind of child at all this time, it was taken by the General Assistant Director and the Protection of the Child Iaşi, which then gave it to concern the Bucium Placement Centre.
There were years when abandoning and adoption were more regulated to Romania today.
In the Centre Bucium was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a Palermo kitchen who wanted to have their child but didn't succeed.
They loved themselves in the place of blonddu ́ Crina, and after a while, he would have moved with them to Italy.
Little has been made almost two years, while the formalities of adoption have been during.
When we saw Crina, I felt that it was our girl.
"It's like my wife would have given her life," he says dreaming Salvadore, an adoptive father, while he's taking into the hand of the female hand of the girl.
In the past, the parents of Crine, Alina and Costic, continued searching separately, everywhere he could.
Father asked the authorities of Ruginosa, but he didn't receive any answer where his child could be.
Then the police sent her that it was possible to be killed, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me to the Court she was gone to Italy, Palermo.
And you're looking for her, I didn't have it anymore.
We prayed to God to be good.
I thought about her all the years that have passed, but it wasn't the possibility to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," he tells us with lacrimes in the eye of Crine's biological mother.
But even if the years have passed, the parents in Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and the wife explained to the girl where she comes and that her past a league from Romania.
I was small when I found it.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted as a kid, I was curious.
"I wanted to know my parents in Romania," she's glad Crina.
And her dream was to become reality.
In March of this year, the Commissioner of Rome Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre of Prevention, Evaluation and Conscilation of Antidrog Iaşi, was contacted by a knowledge of Italy, which explained the desire of Salvador to find the Crine biological family.
And the search has just started from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first time.
We only received a name, Balcan Costical, then the locality, Ruginosa.
Shortly, I had an activity with the premises from there, and I could ask if there was a local name received.
Then they gave me a few indications, just that the found wasn't the search.
"It was a few days later to find the girl's biological father," explains the Commissioner of the Roman Jechim.
In total, more than three months, they took the authorities to take Costic and Alina, especially that everyone had the house in another place.
We started the demors somewhere in March, and in June-July, we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"When I found that in September a first meeting," added Romanic Ikim.
In the weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their girl lost in Iaşi's holidays, 20 years ago.
Dad, emotionated, could almost have dominated his lacrims, and his hands were scared in silence.
Abya changed a few talks with those around.
With a week before the meeting, he couldn't sleep.
He was all emotional, trembling.
"To see your kid after so many years, it's something," a grandmother says to us, come and she with Costica from Ruginosa.
Crine's meeting with Mom and Biological Brother
In the discussions with his girl, who is going to study at a well covered university in Italy, Costic Balcan told her, among others, that if someone wants to come back to him in the city, he will be quiet: - It may give a sheep, cap, to give her a boy in the village and take a hostage.
Mom's and she's emotionated, she's crying, and she thinks hardly that she can't say something like that.
I'm very emotional.
I didn't think it could be like that.
I saw such cases in the television, I always thought about those years, I hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If she could forgive me.
I hope we'll visit us in the future.
"I hope we can keep a connection," he says with big lacrimes on the oppressors Alina, Crine's mother, while he's assembled in a service.
In him she hids her lakes, happiness, because she'll be seen with her daughter after so bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will fulfill only a few days, this month, 20 years old, try to relax like a emotional child.
She doesn't know what to wait, but she scattered a idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting, he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he's very much to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally those who have grown up.
It's gonna be a beautiful meeting, a great experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now I'm so much to say," says Crina.
First family meeting in Iaşi
In the United States, under the beginning of the trumpet, the family of Ruginosa reunises their destination with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina has 20 years ago, finishing school, according to the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costic, her biological parents.
Not more borders or countries, but only a barier: the language.
Peses that, with a translator's help, a Italian owner in the centre of Iaš, have passed easily.
Those who have succeeded to make this meeting possible say that it's the first event of this kind made, and that, in the future, if it gets more opportunity, they'll do it again.
It's the first event of this organized, such emotional load, and I'm going to be a success.
We, at the Centre, have activities, and most times we are associated as an institution that is only involved in consumption, drugs.
But we're trying to restore society something good back.
"If I'm still asked for such a event, I'll make it very pleasant," he says dreaming Romanic Ichim, director of the Regional Prevention, Evaluation and Antidrog Iaşi Conciliation.
After him, the Balcan family, with Crina in the middle, is divided by the story.
They're understanding: they have many to tell others.
Army with pick-up weapons, yesterday, at PSD.
Everyone takes his soul
The outside of the PSD branch has completed an army with guns.
After successful discussions, on Sunday Friday, first and most stressed, the PSD leaders agreed to suspend temporarily losses.
Present by the Executive President of the Party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united, social-democracy outside will send it a full list of potential candidates to the functions of the party.
Despite finishing, the internal war from the party seems to have been taken only a pause to allow the fighters to trace their soul.
Dragnea didn't give a ultimatum.
He has launched a very simple and very real message in the events of now: try to find a solution to not put the party in danger.
On 3 October, we have elections in the party.
All functions will be placed at the disposal of those who want them.
"P" then, we're in existing," said Mihai Chirica, the interim primary.
The two days of weekend discussions were just concluded that nothing certain was not established.
At the elections of October, for the chairman of the Jewish PSD branch, a urgent competition is expected.
On the short list of possible candidates at the main function of the outcome office of the party, the state secretary Maricell Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazer, Jewish Vasile Casea and the interim president of the Judecean Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could be added to the Common Prime Minister of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variance to be calculated is also the candidate to the leader of the Jewish leaders of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer be recorded in the course, sources from the party showing that it is not interested in functions.
The only name not mentioned by any of the participants in negotiations in the last days is the former leader of the branch, primary Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is disconnected.
In accordance with the statute, including on the day of elections, candidates may be issued, and they would not wonder anyone if it would.
"It is important that we be united, and we will also be held after 3 October, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Judecean Office and all the new leading offices," stated Câtea.
In the organization of internal elections, the leadership of the Jewish PSD branch will be assured by Victorel Lupu, a closer of Nichita and Stanciu.
But Lupu is in consent on 29 September, preparing elections to be practically ensured by the Executive Secretary of the branch, the Jewish Jewish Mihail Popescu, found in recent relations with the town of Nichita.
With the phone contact, Cristian Stanciu has discussed the last days as leading to a "partal consensus".
There is a large ability to maintain the balance and unit in the party.
It reached a partly conscious, in the meaning of supporting a uniting team to take care of Jewish.
"Therefore, on the other hand, there are more variants on candidature's intentions to the PSD Iaşi presidency, a list of discharges," Stanciu commented.
A Jewish exhibitor refused the Vaslu violators folder for the reason of congénaj
The seven youths in your Jewish Jude condemned for violation come to the Court of Appel Iaşi today.
The Vasluen sentenced on penalties between five and eight months and eight months and four months will present today their arguments on their freedom, after the foundation of the Vaslui Judge has established their captivity immediately after the speaking of the sense.
The Directory was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, magistrate Dan Anton, formulating a request for receipt, accepted by his colleagues.
Anton called the fact that one of the accused lawyers, a lawyer Bogdan Luca, is with his daughter, a lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca looks like Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the greatest penalty in this folder.
How the judgings motivated
At the end of the last week, the judge of Vaslu Judge, who condemned the seven young ones, motivated sense.
In motivation, the judge speaks of the deficiency of accusations, but also of those who have supported them, indicating that such attitudes create a strong sense of anger in the public opinion.
"Instance notes that after the time of the position under the prevention of Judic control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not private freedom, under the impact of the view of the offences, the local supporters and their local supporters, a powerful sense of irritation has been rejected at the level of local and national community as regards the fact that accused of serious facts are judged under a less restrictive measure," it is shown in the motivation of the Vascian Judge.
The judges also demounted the main appearance of the seven offended who during the process invoked the fact that the girl who violated it would not be "the church door".
"Instance underlines that it is lack of the moral quality of the vital, the aspect of which the accusations wanted to demonstrate through the opinions they had formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be distorted under any pretext," it is further indicated in motivation.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
In economic and demographic cases, the prosperity that have been made in the past ten years cannot continue the same in the following years.
Saturday probably a little world knows who is Jeremy Corbyn in Romania.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Laburist Party in the United Kingdom, many wonder how much it can affect us by choosing a political person who, therefore, is not in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leader of the labs after war.
Marxist stated, anti-monarist (asking to Tony Blair at a moment, then the Prime Minister, to take out the real family from Buckingam Palace), a fero American and a sympathy of Vladimir Putin (he was otherwise invited to comment on the political events from the TV channel "Russia Today") and the terrorist moves of Hizbollah and Hamas, he wanted that the Greek Britain would return to nuclear weapons and go out from the NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who considered the killing of Osama bin Laden at that time as a real tragedy, ISIS is nearly preferred by the United States.
According to the model of all popular demogogs, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
The things of the type of those he said and promised and Tsi's in Greece at the moment when he made a piece with the real world and the economic laws.
The economic programme of the new labourist leader provides, among other things, massive renacionalizations and money recovery as a solution for funding projects of design and covering very generous social benefits.
Certainly, some might ask why the solution to solve money is not uniquely adopted on the world, then we have a global prosperity! but who should prevent such details.
Of course, we can pay to blood on bankers, you become a sort of enemy of service at the left, but from what it has been seen in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Holland mandates.
Additional amounts are quickly covered by generous promises, without covering, made by popular demagogues.
According to Margaret Thatcher's attention, "the socialism's problem is that at a time the money of others ends."
Sometimes I give Jeremy Corbyn real opportunities to come to the Prime Minister.
At the beginning of the 1980s, another radical leader of the left, Michael Foot, who was not as extremely convinced as the leader of the party, failed in choices.
And then there was still a working class in the Greece, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and consistent.
And the syndicats were more powerful than now.
In the new industrial area, where services are dominant in the assembly of work forces, and extensive automatizations made that in the industry need a massive highly qualified work, Corbyn's retorney has a limited call.
However, even in a position, he can influence important evolutions that can affect us directly.
In its last number of Financial Times, Corbyn's choice increases Brexit's chances, so that the EU's British Marine outcome.
The new labour leader was a consistent opposite of the country's apartment in the Union.
In the radical left eyes of Brussels, the international capitalism agent and a promotor of globalization that imposed the poverty of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration retoric, and look at the crisis of reactions that disturb from the EU's foundations, you reach an explosive mixture.
And not just for the British Sea.
However, if the britains decide according to the referendum, which would have to take place in 2017, the Union will deal with the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the advanced falls created within the Euro crisis and now the reactions, between North and South, between East and West, leave the scenarios of the most concerned.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was an opposite to the French-German Axis (in which the Berlin becomes still more dominant).
It's true, the British environment, the City, are powerful lawyers of the country in the EU.
However, Europe today is not the past.
There are many feelings that grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I had even recently a demonstration in Jean Clude Junker's speech, has to make major decisions over the head of the major major majority of the Member States by consulting only a few European powers, in particular with Germany.
And this is in the cases where electoral design for anti-immigration, anti-immigration that are at the same time and the eurosceptic grows spectaculars over the whole continent.
In other words, emotional climate with negative load has reached higher costs than ever in the past.
Where and where the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when it evaluates Brexit's chances.
The EU option is based on a clear calculation from national interest.
If the members will make the brain decision, then the British British will be in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in the current policy.
Or, East Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
In particular, if, as it is expected, we will assist a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will emphasize most of the countries in the region and the area of interest and the decision process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsi et ́za in Greece, Podmos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds its popular retorn from the frustrations acumulated in the western society.
In economic and demographic cases, the prosperity of the last ten years, generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro area - immigration, both caused by private decisions that have not been calculated except integrational political ambitions, not also the ability and ability of the peoples and peoples in Europe to respond to such challenges, turbulences on the continent, the EU's internal pressures will increase in intensity and can affect Romania.
And it's hard to exclude something from the view of possible scenarios.
Age is if our main political leaders are able to face such complicated actions.
Constantin Blancussi, the god of the country.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
They said, "Take the wind!"
The big sculptor had a great dream: that it may be someone, that he may come to celebration, that he may hear about him throughout the world.
But behind his rename, something is hidden almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, networked for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "three".
What do you want to write about Constantin Blancus?
What else is it to say, actually?
The figure came on the night.
And soon, a Romanian actor employed an actor to play it in a publicary moment.
He produced and delivered money at almost 60 years since it wasn't between us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and bulevards that bring their name.
Otherwise, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes outside with the adult, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to the Blancs."
The country is distributed by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are to be of such a world, from children, to age.
The Infiltration Capacity of Blancus is a big.
No communists succeeded to remove him from Romania's memory and culture.
His sites are distributing the Internet today, getting hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what would it be to say, write about this man?
Looking out of the number of books and articles that are trying to reconstitute its destination, the life of Brandués seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there's those people who tell you that, if you didn't have the town to be born in a large city and in a family as much as it's, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
The way of Brancuşi is the perfect example.
And maybe there'd be a key here.
Maybe the next text should be started from here.
With a sensation, all of them are hatable.
See the stories of cretin success, which are delivered in the journal and television.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he's lived, how, today, he has heard a whole mapmond?
It's simple.
He worked all life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancuşi was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobi, a small city of the commune Pestishani, Jew Gorj, at the pools of Carpati.
It's the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Blancussi.
Although he came into a family of stated countries, the Branchus leads a modesty life, but one of them would have the repers that will lead to his later artistic vision.
Remembering the childhood and the places in which he grows, the artist would witness, in a meeting with Peter Turkish, from Paris, of 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious."
Thousands, people were leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went quiet from anonymous to another.
And you know why things changed?
The great city's civilization came to us.
Brencusse's childhood, however, was far away from an identical.
One of the moments in those first years of life is extremely suggestive for the purity and violence combined that have characterized the future sculptor years in the country.
The moment is played in the work "Brancuşi. A biografie," wrote by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brandués was three years old.
In the midst of that year, when the tissue was made "la casan", following those who shoot the liquor to see whether the process is executed as necessary, the Brancus takes a time of general independence.
He's filling his palms' kitchen and drinking on the non-suflate.
He falls in the dream almost instinctly.
The first people are watching almost after a few minutes.
Mom comes into a panic, then in hisstery, thinking his son died.
On the evening, when father, Radu, turns away from the lives of the praises, he looks from the divorce of the desperate signs of those who hold him with the soul to the mouth.
The festival is turning to jail immediately.
Dad's already thinking about the grave.
Nevertheless, somebody thinks it's good to call Baba Brandusha, the Doctorship and the Service of the Branch.
The bridge checks the child's respiration, then puts it under the nose of the horse ball, gathered in the preach.
The mighty stranger kid.
The world's appealing.
While the poor is allowed to sleep along the beauty, from the Ethiopian, the celebration with the lovers continues with and more strength.
The second day, the father and the son meet themselves through a library.
Radu Blancus puts Constantin to assemble the news and bring them.
Dad puts his child with his head down, and, with the clouds brought up, he spends him to keep his mind.
And while it feels the wounding of the swords, the little Blanchus has the revelation that the world can be seen and in another perspective and that things around can look back.
In particular, the position of the sun, different from the good, makes him wonder how he would recognize the elderly, if no one himself awaits his pain.
To have been the sun as a painful like his father for what he had done?
At the current time, the city doesn't work
A parliamentary calls for politicians to remember those who voted.
Independent Viorel Bléjuţ invited PSD and PNL to stop the internal lights and to reorient its agenda to electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great decision.
I didn't see anything of the 2012 USL projects to continue.
No autostrade, nor Regional Spital of Urgences, you see just how politicians have their potential broadcastings depending on immobilious interests.
Let's get a little political away, gather and talk.
At the current time, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," said the Blajutz.
He realized that the current political class has dismissed the electorate outside, consequently, a very reduced presence to the live local elections around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The lawyer also believes that the members will direct themselves to traditional parties, expressing their reservation to new political initiatives, such as the "Patru Iaşi" party which will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and they will do only to break from the right electoral, not from the PSD.
Such partys are based on civil activity people, which are normally right.
"It's more right, what's wrong for nobody, neither for PSD," said the Blue.
He claimed that he was not interested in a candidate to the victorious local elections, dismissing the voices of his intention to record in the course of Primaries.
I've been saying that they don't want to candy any local function.
I'm still thinking if you continue as a lawyer and in the future mandate.
I tried to call for the unit for Iaşi and the talks about the hols, with other parliamentaries, and I was accused that they wanted to make my pictures.
They don't want, but we can't keep that.
"If people have voted on us, it doesn't mean that they're strange to vote more -- if I don't see anything," said Blåjutz, who made that the main reason why electorate is not interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elections.
A colleague from Tatterashe said I don't get his money and I've got to go with the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
It's not little money.
Sometimes I'm worried to get the money out of the casier.
At the end of the mandate, I will make a report with everything I've expelled, outside the salaries of employees from the cabinet and the maintenance of it.
I'm going to lift up in a month and 30,000 league, with all transport decounts, rooms and other.
"Tell a parliamentary that his money doesn't get it is pure hypocrisy," Blåjutz ended.
