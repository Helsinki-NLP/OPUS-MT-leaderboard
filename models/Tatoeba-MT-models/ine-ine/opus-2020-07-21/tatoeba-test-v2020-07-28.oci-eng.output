Where are you going?
That you like the man's pair you had it.
The Burj Khalifa is now a higher gratacell of the world.
Whoever keeps you planning.
There's the tons around here.
I've been a song.
The one shows that it's the face.
You can't agree with his pause.
What do you say?
The water is alive.
The Thom is as large as the speech.
That stops to be pinted.
You dance?
Return to the left hand.
That's my brains.
That's all right?
One, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
The man that's talenting.
Do you like your maire?
What did Bell invent?
Where are you going?
The two of them I'm cut.
