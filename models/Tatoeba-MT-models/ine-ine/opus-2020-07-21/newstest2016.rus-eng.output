The social card of the Ivanian area is recognised by the electronic payment.
Amendments are expected to maintain the debt for transition in the public passport.
Since September 24, the order for the low-treatment of citizens is changed using the map of the resident of the Ivan area.
As reported by the Russian Government on the Ivan Area, changes are made to maintain public passport liabilities and bring an interim account scheme in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 FZ " O National System".
In this case, the map of the resident in the Ivan area is recognised by the electronic payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its application are changed.
So, the full limit is now established not in railways, as before, but in the amount of feeds, with winter and years of winter - not more than 400 rubbles, and in the year period no more than 800 rubbles per the current month.
Now the holders of the map on the transfer of quotas should not follow the amount of residues of poez, but the rest of the resources.
The rate of the low passenger for the citizens is 1/2 of the tariff of the carrier.
The remaining half value of transition is paying the regional budget.
The graph of compliance with the card with feeding means remains the previous - in the 24th number of the previous month to 23th of the current month.
The new schedule of transition on the card will have a number of benefits.
Yes, a detailed account of the expenditure on the card is available with precision to coppers.
Moreover, there is a possibility of returning counting, but unexpected feedback.
Let us also add that the system of accounts with the carriers becomes transparent, since the half value of transition is now paying to the citizens, and it is exactly the same amount that the carrier pays the budget.
No Commission will be taken to the cart of the feed.
In its course, Basilius Silkin, the director of the Department of Travel and Transport of Ivan, reported that in 2014 there were more than 33 million poezes in the region using the card, in 2015 nearly 25 million poezes.
In the area of the budget for the provision of leaving citizens with the use of the card, there are more than 470 million rubles.
On 1 September, more than 312 million rubbers were refunded.
During the call at 911 teacher, a friend's murder is recognized
During the 911 voice, the teacher of Shan Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that they had to come home.
Lamb highlighted that there was a "six" in the house that lived, but probably was disappointed, and said that the contacts of the family's dead members could be found at her phone.
Inside the house, the police discovered the body of Emmy Prentiss and the note written from the hand on the white paper of the linear paper: "I'm so sorry, I would like to return, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who had ever loved me," says the record, according to the representatives of the organs signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who led two online curses at the Delta University of Cleveland, Mississippi, had succeeded to take 300 miles in the university campus, where the police believed that he had shot all the relevant teachers of the history of Ithan Schmidt on the road of his office.
The Police Boss of Delta Baford's State University reported that the University had learned about the shooting at 10:18 tomorrow.
He reported that Lamb had made the true call in 911 in the afternoon.
By the end of the day, the victim will be one more: the Lamb ended with himself as the police had surrounded it.
On the day after the shooting in school for students and teachers to take care of the doors closed, the bodies still tried to put on a picture of the motivation that Lamb had built.
Included by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and the students who knew it, helped to build a portrait of a talented, but perhaps a comfortable teacher.
Students told that they had been waiting for his jobs.
The police in Gothia, where Prentiss was dead, reported that he was not complained with violence or commitment.
Sam Schmidt included Lamba in a written book in which he expressed appreciation for the "beauty people" with which he crossed in his teacher's life.
Both of them were trained at the university of sciences and history, which counted 17 teachers, and many students visited the lessons of them and of the other.
At the same time, there were some suggestions for problems.
One student, who had a good answer about Lambe, Brandon Bivers, reported that he looked as anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sakes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the year 2014-15 about how he was stressed.
Earlier Lamb asked the Delta State University to give him a discharge of disease, saying that he had some health problems.
In this year, he trained only two online curses.
Recent changes in university rules have been adopted to be indicated that the degree of the doctor on which Lamb had so sustainablely worked would not guarantee that he would have received an appointment of the teacher.
The President of the University of William Laforge reported that he had nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Of course, Mr. Lamba had something in mind."
These are questions that Lamb will not be able to answer anymore.
The police attacked Lamba after he fled from the campus when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before his figs were arrested, Lamb shot 38 calibres from the back court of the house, one milk to the south from his parents's house at Greenville, Mississippi, reported the corner of the province of Washington Mattel Johnson.
His car with the worker was still on the road.
In fact, it was unintelligent why Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said she believed he knew he was living in it.
The lamb grows in those lands.
Lamb began to work at the University, in which 3500 students in the town with a population of approximately 12000 in 2009 and trained geographic and pedagogic.
He received the degree of the pedagogic sciences of the same year.
One of the old friends of Lamba described it as a smart, charism, and a pleasant man.
Carla Hearston race, who was 15 years old, and Lamba 20 years when they met by general friends.
She and her friends learned in the elderly classs, and he was a classic older guy who tried to learn her to play on gitarr for a few years.
In those years, he was successful in women.
All the secrets were when he was near," says Hearston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brandon's village.
Lamb and Prentius have seen the event for a while.
When the 911 Lamb called, he said, "I killed my wife," but the registration of their marriage is not available.
The couple had a song named Littlening, who lived with them in Gothia in a cyrpical house, whose back side is going to the channel.
According to the police, the dog's okay.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'Stin, reported that they were spent 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and that they had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"He's totally worried," O'Stin told about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in and played a blue.
Lamb met Princess when he and Abigail acted on one age of three years ago.
Then they played time together on concerts.
O'Stin told his daughter to write to and sing.
Princes was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, the barman and the co-ordinator divorced the programs in the bar of the Julep Room in the area of Gothia, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss on September 5 when the Lamb ended playing on the gitarr and mouth harmony for small visitors.
No doubt was observed.
"As just a happy couple," said he.
We rejoiced and looked for each other.
I mean, they were both very obscure.
Smidt, the dead teacher, has held seminars for first-coursers and specialized in the history of the Korean Americans and the United States, told Don Allan Mitchell, a teacher of English in the same education.
He was married, and he had three small children.
He was trained at the University of Cansas in Empire and was a president of studentship and self-administration.
In the campus of Delta's University in Cleveland on Thursday, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the memory ceremonie of the feedingstuff.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony while the University Hors sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The jobs will be renewed in the middle.
"We're trying to return our students," Laforge said.
Crisis passed.
Today, healing day.
Amy and Rohelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped to prepare the authors of Press Emily Vagster Pe’us in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santan in New Orleans.
The material was addressed in relation to the police statement that Lamba's call was made to the service of 911 after the murder of Schmidt, and that, despite the Lamb talked about Princess as his wife when he called in 911, the information that they had been married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to take less of the feast to the festival
Toys R Us notes that it will not take the same time for a festival season as last year, and the player of games and goods for children ensures that it will provide the State staff and the temporary facilities for more hours.
The company reports that it is planning to set up 40 000 people for work in businesses and optical bases throughout the country, less than 45 000 who were taken for the 2014 festival season.
Most slaves will be partly occupied.
The company reported that the meeting with the representatives would be started in this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Though a few months ago, the purchase season is closer, and the companies are prepared for the most temporary holdings to have enough states in the stores and sales, decharge and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox's foolishing about the "visition" with Princess Diana.
The Premier of the "Return in the Future" film on the Great Event for Michael J. Fox.
She was a note for different reasons.
"We were sitting in the film and waiting for the arrival of the king's family, I noticed that the place near me is free, and here I've been stuck - the princess of Diana will sit near me," he said in the trainer to quickly go on the documentary film "Return to time."
It's starting a movie, and here I'm in mind that I'm literally in the distance of your hands and in one false wheel from meeting with Princess Wells.
"Return in time" is a documentary film on the "Return in the Future" - includes a interview with Fox, Ley Tompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as a register of Robert Landkis and a executive producer Steven Spilbergo.

"Return in time" will be available to VOD, DVD and some films in October.
Chapter of the United Nations states that there is no military decision in Syria
The Secretary-General Pan Gi Mun states in response to Russia for the military support of Syria that for nearly five-year-old conflict of military decisions, the increase in arms will only destroy violence and suffering for millions of people.
The United Nations Chapter again invited all participants, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support integrated negotiations to find a political decision.
Mr. Gi Mun stated at the press conference in the environment that he planned a meeting with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, five permanent members of the Council of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France at the session of the Ministerial session of the General Assembly in this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed the regret that the differences in the Council and among the Syrian and the responsibility authorities were "insolvable".
Mr. Gi Mun invited five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in the decision of the nuclear programme on Iran and in the examination of the Syrian crisis.
8 of the results of the question that Donald Trump doesn't hurt
They were trying to put on it the carpet of the producer.
Others dismissed him, taking a shot.
And some need scandal.
However, as some of the resorts are trying to deal with the high position of Donald Trompa in the results of the issues, they have failed (away).
Ten of the last 11 national enquiries have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in two-second numbers, and some start seriously asking what this means for the incapacity of getting a name.
Of course, it's just the beginning of a choice cycle.
It doesn't mean that the Trump has the chance to nominate the Republic of the Party.
Experts indicate that Rick Perry at that time had been in 2011 to the German Population of Cain, whose country was not in the process of nomination.
And there are reasons why he would be able to fight at the general elections.
But the external groups such as the Supreme Court of Political Activity, Jeba Bush, and the Economic Conservative Group of the " Cross Club" recognize the unappreciative force of Trumpa and begin to gain their dollars to distort it.
Here are some of the issues that say that the inevitability is not just a intermediate phase:
The sympathetic ratings for Trumpa were 180 degrees.
Immediately before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the middle of June, the question at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 resorts were linked to this magnet in the area of insufficiency.
Within July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 per cent.
Now, six of the 10 republics are locally related to Donald Tromp.
Approximately three of the 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators are obtained at the beginning stages.
The question of Quinnipiac in Iowa was shown last week that 60 per cent of the resp there are relatives to Trump.
Two thirds of the votes for the GOP would establish Trum ́ as a candidate.
In the question of CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the repairs said that they had been taken " with anxiety" or "compliance" if the Trump had been candidate.
Only two of the 10 say they'd be "build," if he was a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as the Trump (43 per cent say they would be "with anxiety" against 40 per cent of those who speak the same about Trumpe).
Next level of attention?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the republicians say that they will be "not satisfied" or "building" if the favorite of Jeb Bush will become a candidate.
Most people do not consider the temperature of Trumpa as a problem.
While the Trumpa is massively criticised for its weight and relief, 52 per cent of the decline to the representatives of the electors throughout the country believe that the appropriate temperature is to be a president, as ABC News/Washington requested on Monday.
The same number is figured on the first in the country in which the same 52 per cent of the resistance people believe that he is the same person who could be the main commander of Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who may be effective to post, and almost six of the 10 independent electors say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, according to the ABC/Post reports.
Resistent electors usually do this.
When they put their trail of signs, the electors-resp think that the Trump is serious.
A question of who the most probably winner in the GOP nomination, four of the 10 said that Trump was a favorite, the CNN/ORC question last week.
It's not the case when four of the 10 placed Jeb Bush on the end of July.
Full distortion: GOP electors have not already had the right criteria before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 resorts chose Rick Perry as the most probably candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate of Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that the GOP electors consider the Trumpa campaign as convinced.
Even if the residents would have replaced around the other candidate, the Trump continues to be before all the other.
The characteristics indicate that such dilution, mostly, plays for the benefit of the Trumpa, and at the same time non-supported Trumpas are equally distributed among the supporters of more than ten other candidates.
But the question carried out by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that, in hypothesis, the "one per one" between the Trum and most other candidates, Trump is almost always supporting the majority.
He defends Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marko Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeba Busha at 19 points and, finally, Randa Paula, John Cassich and Criss Cristia at 33 points.
He has nobody with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to him?
Ben Carson's businessmen for 19 points of hypothesis with the "one per one".
Almost half of Donald Trumpa's sides say they were before.
The new CBS/NYT issued on Thursday shows that only half of the voters supporting the Trumpa say that they are confident in their votes.
Of course, many can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he never changes.
46 per cent claim that they remain open for other candidates.
However, the most stressed competition in the Trump at this moment is with Ben Carson Neurochirus colleague, but the electors who say they were before, most likely, will choose the Trump.
Six of the 10 republicans say they are with Tram in the way of immigration.
Since two months ago, Donald Trump called the immigrants from Me 'emists in his statement, which opens the campaign, the immigration is the most active issue in 2016.
Some are concerned that the treasure of Trumpa will reject the key electors of Latin American origin from the Response Party and reduce the banking.
But in the ABC/Post question on Monday, six of the 10 repositories say that they are with Trum in immigration issues.
Thus, until the immigration reaches general attention, Donald Trump remains at the same position.
The disappointment by the Government is making new trades.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting for support about half of the electors-resp, mainly because of their status of aids.
Sex of the 10 repositories on Monday, the ABC/Post new question states that they want a political authsider more than a person with the experience of work in the Government.
And they're also at Washington.
The Question of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, a two weeks ago, shows that three of the four residents in Iowa have been disappointed by the activity of residents in the Congress, 54 per cent were "incomplete" and 21 per cent "in anger".
The Government will decide to judge pension indexations in October.
Vicepremier RF Olga Holodец stated that the Government is currently looking for for the implementation of the Pension Index Act in 2016 to the real level of inflation, GG.
She noted that the decision was to be found until 8 October until the budget was submitted to the Government.
Moreover, the bamine discusses the option of prolonging the decision on the deterioration of the Russian grave pension.
The cold noted that the amount of pensions was 350 billion rubbles.
About the same amount is the penalties indexation in the total amount of the year.
According to the vice-premier, there is no urgent decision on who should contribute to non-governmental citizens.
The hungry believes that if a person doesn't work on his own initiative and doesn't happen, however, to the unsecure category of citizens, it is not just what the society will be for him.
Earlier, the MI reported that the cabinet was considered two alternatives for the balance of Mrs Budget.
Why are they often disappointed and red?

Our centuries are widths that protect the eye egg from the ability of small parts on them.

Asad invited all forces to join terrorism.
The President of Syria Bashar Asad invited all forces to join terrorism.
Asad is sure that if it wants to cope with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists at the Middle East.
The question is not that it accepts or does not take refugees, but that it is necessary to remove the causes of this problem.
If the soldier is concerned about the court of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the question of refugees," he said in the RT interview.
We must continue dialogue on behalf of the consensus.
However, if we want real successes, they are not until people go away until blood transfusion continues and people feel secure.
"Thus, we can reach consensus, but we can't make anything until we win terrorism in Syria," stressed Asade.

Jeremy Corbin debutters the Premier Minister ' s issues at the session
After the elections of Mr. Corbine, the Premier Minister's issues are expected with great impatience at the session
The new leader of the Leabory Party of Jeremy Corbin will soon take place at the Premier Minister ' s session, first measured by David Qaeron.
Mr. Corbin will discuss the first of the six issues issued in the second half of the day, and, according to his statement, the presision and members of the Parliament from the Leiborist Party will be approved.
He expressed the call "small theater and more facts" to a marriage demonstration thing.
He also stated that some meetings could be lost by leaveing them to the colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary statement of Mr. Corbin as a ru-house; it will occur after the assignment of their tiny office and his words at the annual Conference of the Tread-Unions on Thursday.
At the time, the Leader's decision to stand silent during the execution of a national district on Thursday, during the celebration of the 75-year-old Bitwa in Britain, the criticism of a number of conservative members of the Parliament and became the subject of several preliminary articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbine's decision not to sing the public guinea took attention
Mr. Corbine's secretary stated that he "stood in a positive silence" and recognized "the King's WWS heroism in Bitwe for British Republic".
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith reported Newsnight on BBC 2, that he would advise the leader of the library to sing a national guinea "unless" from his conviction if it was necessary to refuse monetic.
Almost a decade of tennial ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's team, acknowledging the differences in economic, defence and international policy, while at least one of the six members of the Part of Parliament supported him as a leader.
The Political Correspondent BBC Robin Brand says that political differences are also "covered by steps" in the Leaborist party after Mr. Corbine was appointed to be assigned to the Union and the Government's compensation payments.
Mr. Corbine stated at the Conference of the Tread-Unions that the Leiborist Party had introduced amendments to refusing the idea of repealing in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Tenne Ministry of Work and Pension Payment stated that there was a "complete clarity" in the party because it had only been in the position of the Government's plans to reduce the range from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the libraries with which David Cameron will meet at the "currier box" in the last ten years from the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Leader of the Leabhars who promised another approach to politics states that he had "attracted collective resources" to put the ideas of Mr. Cameroon's issues and received more than 30.000 proposals.
The Member of the Parliament from the province of Eilington North stated that the Premier Ministry issues were caused to be extremely conflicted and that it would also be retained from anxious response and exchange of quantities, rather than promised to focus on serious issues such as poverty, neighbourhood and problems that arose before youth.
Mr. Corbin said that Angel Igle, Minister of Economy in the tent office, would replace him on the issues of the Prime Minister when he would be missing - for example, when Mr. Cameron is outside the border.
He also understood the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the word when possible, saying that he was referring to the John Bercoo Communicator to discuss this issue.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to avoid the political style of the Jarmal Balkan, often associated with the Premier Ministry ' s procedure, but recognized that he had failed several years later.
Since the first translation in 1990, the Prime Minister's issues became a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to manage the Community and the reputation of other members of the Parliament, although critics claim that this has been converted into a carcatera and requires extent reforms.

The Sterling Pound is increasing in Greece
In the United Kingdom, the FTSE 100 index was grown up using the proposal for the SABMiller buying.
Since May to June in Britain, based on bonuses, 2,9 per cent increased in comparison with the similar period of the past year.
The growth speed was highest since 2009, and it was met as a preliminary time for the potential growth of cattle.
The sterling pound increased more than 1% per dollar and $1,5505, and $1,84 per cent by €1,3730.
FTSE index 100 grows up to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMillers were assigned, which increased by 20 per cent by the proposal for purchase from the AB InBev competitor.
The transaction would unit two largest birds in the world, with such bridges as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's actions increased by 0.9% at the background of the hopeful news from the competitive group of producers of Lux Ricemont.
The latest data on the Richemont sales have overcome all expectations and have shown that sales in China, on the key market for Burberry, began to grow again.
Glencore's actions increased by 5 per cent after the high-country gigant claimed that the amount of 2.5 billion dollars was obtained by the distribution of assets, which was made in the reduction framework of the decrease.
Actions for paper production and packaging materials were the leaders of the index falling - 4,3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs had reduced the group's rating to sale.
JD Sports' actions increased after the company, the supplier of a 83 percent, reported to the 83 per cent increase, reached up to 46.6 million pounds.
Boss JD Sports says that higher payments can reduce expansions
The Executive Director JD Sports Peter Caugil says that the increase in the minimum payment for British slaves means "a greater ability to buy in potential consumers' charms".
But it is unlikely that such purchasing ability will overcome the increase in the rate of labour debts, he says.
The losses could be affected by JD Sports extension plans, added that the number of additional vacations could be reduced.
Metcash starts a campaign for Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi pressure in South Australia and West Australia.
The general supplier of food products at the low initiative has launched a campaign for the protection of the IGA market shares in South Australia and West Australia in the light of the existing influence of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is ready to open two opt stocks and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of the year, the Metcash and IGA surmarkets strengthen the provision of food suppliers and move IGA's borders through the marketing of MMEs and networks and the Adelaide Show activities.
The campaign is attended by IGAs and IGA suppliers, such as the manufacturer of the rocked Simmo's from Dansboro, who is degust in IGA stores, and the owners of the magazines who sell a billet to permanent customers in the South Australia Football Liga.
It is expected that Metcash will discover more details of its protection on September 29 - the day when this optical supplier of food, drinks and households will carry out its annual investor's day.
There was no rate on the horse, since in South Australia and Western Australia, the townships under the IGA bridge included nearly 30 per cent of all the Metcash magazines and higher rentality than the Metcash IGA network in the East States.
The purchasers in South and West Australia are as normal routes complaints, thus the market is more favourable for IGA riders than in the States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in UA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in East States.
However, analyses, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will have 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months after the opening of their first stores, taking into account the amount of all present players, but mainly in independent players.
In the report recorded this week, Tom Kirat, Morgan Stanley analysis, believes IGAs can lose 360 million dollars per year, and Metcash is 250 million dollars until the end of 2016.
Prognoses of the fact that Aldi will open 25 travels in SA and 30 in WA in the year, with the sale of 500 million and 600 million dollars in these markets respectively.
The loss of expenditure and sales of food products at a high level of constant debt of Metcash may cost a company of about 13 million income before payment of percentages and taxes, Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses the market share in the east states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and it is when the recent investigation of Morgan Survey discovered that IGA is the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sales of food products metcash will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the market share of the company from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the manager of the funds, the foundation of the Magellan Financial Group, noted that Metcash could disappear for decades.
The Metcash company from the public comments of Mr. Douglas.
But it is supposed that the member of the Board of Directors of the Company Metcash has communicated with Mr. Douglas last week.
The IGA share on the market was reduced from 2010 from 18 to 14 per cent, and the Metcash income from business in the field of food products that the company puts about 1200 IGA rentals, with 43 per cent compared to 2012 by operational delegation and due to the pressure on sales and rentability indicators.
Nevertheless, the company does not think that over 150 million dollars per year for the balance of different prices in Coles and WoolPropertyths for thousands of wedding places and helping IGAs to recycle trade areas, as well as the rapid increased assortiment of fresh products and a widespread choice of food products.
The Director-General Metcash Ian Morris says that the equation of prices and recycling of trade areas is to be able to carry out markets and hopes that the company should increase pure arrival in 2017, first of four years.
Tanasi Cockinakise supports President Tennis ́a Steve Hilli
Tanasi Cockinakis deserves the start, not critics for his behavior.
Tanasi Cockinakis has suffered in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiros and is deserved for his behavior more than critics, as President Tennis said to Steve Hill.
Cockinakis, the youngest in the talented duet, and often called "Special Ks", was unnecessaryly shown in the centre of attention because of the confusion of Kiros with Stan Vabrinca on Montreal Masters tournament.
In the next time, during the heavy kwalk of the Cincinate, the judge had two times to separate Cokinaxis and his opposite Ryan Harrison, Harrison said, "Wabrin should have been put on the Kiros's lobbys, and I must put it on the lobbys of this guy."
C the pounds, as Cockinaks last saw the cracking cancer after the boss in his feet saved Rishara Gaske from the possibility of hurt to the US Open, Hilli loyally protected the Cookinaxis.
Youth is currently located in Glasgo, with the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in the single range of Cubka Davis against Britain.
"I am anxious about one thing, exactly that Tanasi was in conflict," said Hilli.
He really broke the racket when he had his feet on US Open, but he wasn't the first player who broke the racket when the hope was over, and I know Tanasy enough well to be sure he would not be sure that he wouldn't be hungry.
But in fact, he had a very good owner in a lot of provocation situations in the United States, with Harrison, etc., and I am sure he deserves confidence.
He's surrounding a great team, a family, and I just think it's been a little unclean.
He's a very young 19-year-old man, he works very much, he's a good team, he has never had any problem with other players, his respect is outside the court, he's intensely trained, he's in a good form, he's a very valuable and developed young person, and I think he should be assessed in devotion.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Cyrus for the important maturity starting on Friday, putting "committee" right out for all, but considering that the guy from Canberry would return to the team as a long-term player.
"For the first time, we want the team to focus on the mad, not on the areas around [Kiros]," said Hilli.
And I think that Nick has taken the power very quickly that people prove to be a Federer and Marrey, he's in the eyes of the p.a., he's allowed a number of serious errors and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his positions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the center of attention for a while so that he can think about them, and it's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Property: Hungary declares the emergency situation, closes the border, holds migrants
By announcing the exceptional situation, Hungary crossed the border with Serbia on Thursday to the southern border and detained those who were trying to go into the country illegally to keep the migrants inside.
In front of the border, hundreds of migrants went up to the border territory, and the Serbian authorities were strictly negatively reacting.
In time, the people who fled from invasive violence to the family, cut down the palaces and based on this scope.
However, the deficiency increased.
When the police headquarters surrounded them, the migrants cried "Open the border" and cried out to the Hungarian Police's address.
At the sign of the protest, food and water were refused.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced the "inacceptable" exposure of migrants from Hungary when they are more and more from Greece and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution of the problem, not of the co-operating damage.
We need negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the nearest days," said Prague, "Ivice Dačich.
Hungarian and Serbian border volunteers started on the day after a block from 28 countries had not been able to deal with the general immigration policy at the joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to carry out the general responsibility for 40.000 people seeking refugees in overflow Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (in a month or at the end of the year) the agreement would be made that the Member States will take another 120.000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
Cancler of Germany Ang; Mercel and Austria need to collect an extreme summit on the week to discuss the immigration crisis covered by the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope that the actions from Brussels or the neighbors are taken.
Thursday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave to the authorities more powers to action on the crisis that allowed them to overcome the roads and to carry out the cases of refugee.
At the time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Sierto stated that his country was also planning to deal with a cross-border to the border with Romania to cross the migrants through the country, now that it had completed the depth on the Serbian border.
The CBS News Correspondent reported that even prisoners were connected to the term after the end of the breakdown of the bullets between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary became the main "country" and the point of crossing the border of the Cross-Association for cross-borders, many of which I have been refugees - war victims in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Victor Orban's Prime Minister insists that the majority of people in the country are economic migrants seeking better life, not refugees, victims of warfare who have the right to protect, and this view is very different from the opinions of other EU countries, namely Germany.
The new laws in force in Hungary in the midnight now consider a crime to cross or a deterioration of a 4-meter (13-fourth) deterioration from the rounds built by the Government to the southern border with Serbia, and include more longer periods for people who are accused of trade.
"For the situation of the mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency situation," said the journalists of the Government of Zoltan Kowach in the South Seged.
We clearly understand that the illegal crossing of the border is crime.
The formal Parliament must still sanction the position of military forces expected at the weekend, but the reporters held at the border are already in a few days of observation of the presence of military tents with vehicles and dogs.
Herd Bacondi, a national security adviser of Orban, reported the caption of 45 authorised bodies, tried to cross the border at the same border, and 15 people are inside the country.
They have crossed the border, breaking the debt, being currently under the police and accused of covering administrative violations on new laws.
The governments quickly rebuild the debt.
On Monday, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven travels on the border with Serbia, in order to lock one of the trailers of the railway, which was locked by the cocktails.
Bes’s headquarters passed through the border near the city of Rioske (Hungria), since the winners placed a workplace to pass people inside the metal of the container, and the number of people gave each other to cross themselves inside.
There were about 20° inside, and there remained thousands of people outside.
Another group of migrants held a main trace from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's benefit over Bernard Sanderson was doublely reduced in the national question
The former Secretary of Hillary Clinton continues to maintain the two significant advantage in the democracy trail for a name throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is following it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent among the original democratic electors (below 58 per cent), and Sanderz and 27 per cent second (above 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Bayden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential round, is supported by 15 per cent of the first democratic electors.
More than five months before the first elections of the democratic elections, most of the democratic electors say that they have been determined with the candidate to support.
Clinton Parties are more confident in their choice than supporting other candidates.
Since CBS News has been investigated last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups and Sanders has received some bonuses.
Clinton maintains a great benefit between women and dead, but this is a short degree.
She's supported among men, and Sanders's left from her to five points.
The preferred pleasure of Clinton to democratic electors up to 50 years, and they and Sanderse are now on the staff.
However, Clinton has still a great privilege among the elderly electors.
In the past month, Clinton was a double number of libers, but now Sanders has a benefit in five points in this group.
Almost half of the first democratic electors throughout the country say that they and the enthusiasm would support Clinton if it became a candidate from that party.
Fourth would support her with some reservations and 15 per cent would support her only because she was candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
It may not be surprised that Clinton's current parties, most likely, will show more enthusiasm to her account.
Among those who do not support Clinton at this time, views are more contrary - only about fourth with enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the first democratic electors say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the smaller number of electors speaks the same about their leader, Donald Trompe (35 per cent).
When there is an open question to the Clinton party, why they want to see her candidate, the most popular response is that she has a needed experience (16 per cent), then the time of a president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 per cent).
Clinton's parties also speak about association with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called "A" on issues and opportunities for election.
Since the vice-president considers the potential participation in elections, 57 per cent of the first democratic electors would like to join the rock - even if the third believes that it is not necessary.
When they ask who they want to see at the second meeting among the candidates from the party, the first democratic electors in most cases are called Bayden.
In the middle of Clinton's side, more than half says they would choose Baiden second, it's more than Sanders.
If Bayden decides not to issue his candidate from the Democrat Party, the acquire of Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase by 20 points with Bayden among the participants of the trail to 30 points without it.
Fifty-five percent of democratic electors see the candidate in Clinton with the best chances of winning overall elections, but this number was reduced by 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Bayden has increased the percentage of those who consider it as the most probably candidate.
However, responding to the question that most important in the candidate, democracy electors choose other options other than the opportunities to be elected.
Analogically, in the past month, no of the candidates from democracy or potential candidates is an inappropriate name for these primary electors.
Democracy candidates, or the potential of candidates, have shown a good result of some key characteristics among primary electors from their party.
Most of them believe that Clinton, Sandersa and Bayden are honest and deserving confidence in people who have good leaderships.
Bayden of all three leads honestly, and the strong side of Clinton in its leaders' qualities.
Thirty per cent of the first democratic electors do not consider that Clinton is honest and deserving confidence, twice more than those who speak the same about Sanderse (15 per cent), but 27 per cent have no certain opinion on it.
The original democratic electors also generally consider the same ideological views of Clinton, Sandersa and Bayden.
All of these measures, approximately four democratic electors have no opinion on Sanderse.
Although the issues of the personal box of email and the server of Hillary Clinton in the presence of her Lord's Secretary are continued, most first-democratic electors have been satisfied with the explanation of this account and believe that it has not affected their general opinion.
But this is a totally different story of the American public.
The half Americans today are not satisfied with its interpretation, but only about three are satisfied.
The opinions of the public were still divided in March, after this story was made.
Most Americans say that the e-mail farmer has never affected their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion has been disrupted.
This is mainly the resistance, more than six of each 10, who claims that their opinion about Clinton has been harmful.
Although Clinton considers the honest and deserving confidence of the electors from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered electors in general: only 32 per cent considers her honest and deserving confidence, eight points below the last month, and 15 compared to the mother.
Seventy-two per cent of registered electors do not consider her honest and deserving confidence.
At the same time, 55 registered electors throughout the country do not consider the Trump as honest and deserving confidence.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good signs on leading qualities.
From six protested candidates by Bayden, Carson and Bush are the best result of honesty.
Most people see Sanderse more honest than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion on him.
The range of errors for the selection of 351 primary democratic electors includes 6 percent points.
As a result of the national question, Ben Carson was closed to Donald Tromp
Ben Carson came to Donald Tromp in the last question of CBS/New York Times
Two of these candidates took half of the electoral votes in a new question, leaving all the other in the search for opposition under the feet
Resistance electors throughout the country continue to support the Trumpa massively, which increased by 23 per cent of support in the recent CBS debate on Fox News last month, up to 27 per cent in the division held on Thursday.
But Carson flew from 6% to 23% for the same period.
The question also showed that Carson was supported in all demographic groups by providing Trompa in a higher educational electoral group.
The rest of the candidates, except Carly Fiorina and the Governor of Ohio John Cassich, returned back with the Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent.
The former Governor of Florida J.B. Bush, an ex-governmental manager of Arkansas Mike Hakabi and a Senator of Florida Marko Rubio together takes a third place of 6%.
The range of errors for the selection of 376 representatives in this new question includes plus-minus 6 per cent, and the question was carried out in September.
The recent CNN/ORC issued last week showed that Carson's growth in trials was 19 per cent supported among the residents, Tram's 32 per cent support.
The latest question of ABC News/Washington Post also showed that the Trump is fully aware of Carson.
With regard to the increased support of Carson last week, Trump made a few critical accidents in the address of the former neurochirurg, even when Carson was apologizing for the doubt of the faith of Tromp.
"We need energy," said the Trump last Sabbath during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of death by Baruch's college
About two years later, after a student lost a college in the Mountains of Pokono, the accusation of murder was sentenced against five people.
"The members of the Pi Delta Psi from the New York College Baruch's brotherhood on Chan "Maycla" Denga during the celebration in September 2013 and did not deliver it to the hospital, which brought him to death," reported the police.
The Office states that a student with an eye-locked and a 30-pound rubsack with a song behind the bridge several times until he tried to set up the goals and walked on the top.
Mr. Deng finally claimed that he had a pain and then fell without consciousness.
The members of Pi Delta Psi didn't call at 911 when Deng lost knowledge, and waited for a hour ago before he was brought to the hospital, they said to the police.
However, they found time to change Denga's clothes, to find his symptoms in Gu and to communicate with Andy Meng, the National President of the Brothership, to ask the advice as he said at the Press Conference of the Police Chef of Chris Vagner.
"In this moment the members of the brotherhood began to receive personal property, by giving goodness to the brotherhood above the health of Michael Denga," said the boss Vagner.
He couldn't save him, and he ended at the morning.
According to the secret report, Deng received a few stupid traumatisms, towels and poverty.
"Too many families have been suffered by the brethren's dedication rituals, since at least one student dies every year, starting from 1970," said Duglas Fayerberg, who represents Deng's family.
Brotherships and their members must be responsible, and this step from the authorities is very important.
Monroe's jury offices have been devoted to the third degree of murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, are accused of violence against a new and criminal negotiation.
"We want to be responsible not only for separate participants, but if there exists that the sanction of all of this is officially or neof, then it is it," said Vagger at the press conference on Thursday.
College Baruch prohibited brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded from its structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve will increase the rates
Increasing taxes will be made, and the "bucks market" will be considered, the debt will grow, and the economy will be decreased in the recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to be, and how long it's going to be.
In particular, the story is little to explain about the time.
The recession was only 11 months after the first increase of the tax and for 86 months.
The gravity of the Federal Reserve in the increase of taxes often, although not always, determines the reaction of economic and financial assets.
The United States Central Bank's administration thus stresses that investors should not focus on the start of taking taxes, but on the amount of adjustment.
Actually, in the game of variables.
Finally, however, the market shareholders may find that the whole rate around the rate is overwhelmed.
"The first increase in the Federal Reserve of Global Financial Crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some as the sign of the end of the era of " money", reported Julian Jessop, the main expert for international economy in Capital Economics, in its commentary for customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of rates in the United States to more normal, but still low levels will be a seismical impulse that many are threatened.
It doesn't mean, but there will be no consequences.
This is how some economic areas could be reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last month or about that, the expectation of increased tax may lead to insufficiency for a while.
However, in increased rate, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It does not seem to have an income from action to 12 to 24 months after the first spring, that is probably reflecting the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche Bank analyses in recent investigation of the results of the increase in federal reserve.
If specific, the market in the past 35 years is often changed - approximately 14 per cent - by the increase of the rates, remains sufficient for 250 days after it (medium growth of 2,6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to the normal status of the average rate of 14,4 per cent for the last six per cent, the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main trade specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, which is held in Barron's.
In Deutsche, the results of valuable booleans have the trend to become more expressed at the stage of increased taxes, and the income from the shares begins to be reduced.
Recesions are the fact of economic life, but increases often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is set in conditions that have not been previously and may have the recession.
In the main case, the internal internal product will be almost at its lowest point during the extent of the increased rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the tax increase from 1950 was only twenty-five years older than 4.5 per cent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 he was 3.6 per cent, a few believe that it is a long time, while in the third quarter he holds only 1.5 per cent, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing tax on such instable economic backgrounds may be risked and questioned "What will happen once again", reported in Deutsche.
The market participants are prepared to increase the tax of the Federal Reserve System all the year, and their view is attached to the meeting of the Federal Committee on the Open Market ended on Thursday.
While many economic and economic specialists believe that FOMC could confirm the increase in the rate at the meeting, the furniture trade only refers to 25 percent probability.
"In our investigation since 1950, all increased rates to today have been located in the super-quality increasing financial resources at the WTO, which broadcasts the pre-receptive picks, very quickly after the start of the restoration," states the report.
In contrast, it was extremely quite long restoration after the latest recession during the selected period.
The current Property is the longer than the Federal Reserve System expected from the end of the last recession; the record of 35 months is only 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income is also instabil while the market is expected to increase the rates, and this scenario sometimes looks like the one that is made for action.
The principle of the difference is that the effectiveness of commitments will be faster than for action when the Federal System changes the course.
In the case of obligations, it seems that the income changes the vector at the same time after the first increase/reduction of cycle rate.
At the end of the increased cycle, the rate of obligations is immediately falling,” reports Deutsche.
The specialists of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in taxes will lead to the deficiency of long-term and short-term liabilities by making a more floor.
In the study of Cathy Jones, an analysis of the fixed income in Swab, often have been better in this climate, although "We still fear the income rate," says Cathy Jones.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already been adapted to the expected results of the Federal System Policy.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and falling inflational expectations, the market has been increasingly stronger in monetary policies," she wrote.
Percentage rates for short-term debt were increased by the deficiencies of more lower, credit advances increased, the volatility increased — all the market characteristics in the implementation of the Federal System Policy.
In general, companies leading their main business in the United States win from increased rates, and the production will be more attractive.
International undertakings with debt will be in the worst situation, since the acquirent dollar makes their production more delightful in the world market space and their valuable financial.
"The history shows that "quality" actions demonstrate the efficiency of the market above three months after the initial rate increase," said Goldman Sachs in the client report.
Companies with stage financial responsibility have enhanced companies with non-stable compliance with the results of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 in average of 5 per cent points.
Company with a high capital rate and low-volatility shares also showed better effectiveness than low quality action, in the average of 4 (percentage) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will be a big question.
Company with a high percentage of low rate loses more, according to Goldman.
In addition to pursuing awards, consumers will benefit from the $1.000.
The bookers could also see the arrival by a higher debt, although experts appear in how quickly this happens.
"BBC Radio 3 is a Classic FM copy," advises a member of the Conservators of Andrew Bingham
The Member of the Conservators of Andrew Bingham discriminated the "decrease of standards"
It proves that it becomes less different from the commercial competitor
BBC Music Awards, too, said that the premium was just covered with Brits.
The colleague on the Parliament of Damien Collinz, which was involving the Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is converted to Classic FM," said the leader of the parliament, encouraging the television company to prove that it does something that commercial companies do not do.
A member of the Parliament of Conservators Andrew Bingham also stated BBC's leadership that the public radiostation is " stupid and becomes less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 - I don't like to use the word "support" - but it's converted to Classic FM," he said.
He also encouraged the BBC Music Awards premium that was launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else, it's two examples that I've come to my mind that you're actually just copying what is on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director-General BBC rejected the accusation, acknowledging that BBC Radio 3 and remotely in front of his commercial companion, when the case is invoked to the living and education of the audience.
What I'm learning by Radio 3, I don't know about the class anywhere.
And his loyalty to living expressions and creation will actually not be compared to anyone.
"So it's really important, I think the Interest of Radio 3 in searching for a new and for new production," he said.
Before this year, BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey said that the radiostation should work much more in order to work with the audience than in the past because the British people are less educated in the class.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child, which had been attacked on the five commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Mass Information and Research.
A member of the parliament from Tory Damien Collinz attacked the Voice - a talent show that BBC solved at the Netherlands Talpa Media for the exhibition price at 22 million pounds of starlins.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed with regard to the lack of originality and different parts?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC show 1, in which Paloma Feit and Boy George as a judge, was made in the "typical BBC style".
He added what he wants from the Corporation to find the "hit in his own household" at a time when it will launch a distractional project.
However, he does not consider that it is necessary to interrupte the new Sessions of The Voice in the future or the use of money to those who have licensed the collection, to other forms.

This means that more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it in any way, for example, sitting on the divan.
But now it comes out on the plate, and you can see a decrease (creasing).
Black Friday Femen, who comes from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for delaying the sale.

Result - opening more than 200 new Screwfix magazines for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Master City Correspondent Daily Mail
The britains say that they are put on the side of the milk and the hair, and rather they take the qualificated east chairers for the implementation of the house.
If you are able to cope with a milk or a wallet to blow the walls, that you are in minority today.
Because, according to the B&Q government company, the British experts are more frequently engaged in the work of unfair work at home.
Veronic Laurie, the new director-General Kingfisher, who holds the home-building services network, reported that the trend has been eligible for qualified masters from Eastern, which serves for minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix magazines, specialized on the goods for masters, and at the same time closing 60 B&Q magazines.
Mrs. Laurie race, I would like to see more women in the B&Q staff, since eight of the ten decisions on the purchase in the store are taken by the representatives of the sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
According to her, it is not to note the recent demographic trends that are characterised by the number of households of single women who are more occupied by their lives than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie said, "In our stores, men still work primarily.
We need to take steps to achieve the balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods obtained are taken to women.
Women play a great role in making decisions.
Mrs. Laurie, one of the five women in the role of British leaders whose actions are taken into account in the FTSE100 Index, also changed the sum of the top-administrators team by getting among the directors of equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is not almost the only company in which 50 per cent of women's managers, including the General and Financial Director.
Mrs. Laurie said, "This was a comprehensive solution, and the divergence is a important question for us.
It was unfortunate to find appropriate women in the Director's advice.
After the group had taken the expenditure for the closure of stores, Kingfisher was reduced by a half-year sales.
As a result of this trend Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new magazines
Time of decision on the rates of the United States Federal Reserve
The peace observes the meetings held by the Federal Reserve Bank in which the decision is taken more important within two days - to take or not a percentage rate in the last decade.
The question of 80 economys carried out by Re日s has found that almost half of those who believed that the Federal Reserve on this drink was now believed that it would still take time and maintain the rates at the level of the current range 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is the story of the event, since seven years ago, since the Federal Reserve has reduced the rate to zero.
Firstly, we agree that the main bank can be moved from a zealous note and start the process of normalization of rates," said Anhel Ubide, leading the International Economy Institute of Peterson.
The United States economy works effectively, the economic amount adds three million dollars to the balance report, and the inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the markets that it should be prepared for changes, but it is all about their confidence that all the chances are against such steps.
The decision will be declared at 20:00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees are going to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!", a hundred of refugees are scanning at the control and control point of Horgosh at the Serbian and Hungarian border.
From Tuesday, Budapest crossed the border for the crowds.
The fugitives have already started to make other route options alongside the roads.
One of them is lying through Romania in a closed border with Serbia.
Another is Croatia and Slovenia in Austria.
According to some data, the buses that brought refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now moved to the city of Shidu at the Croatian border.
The leaders received a discharge from the authorities to follow without delay.
The Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs Neboš Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything dependent on it to help refugees, but its opportunities are:
Our work is to ensure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we should also help these people to ensure their humanitarian attitude.
But it's already a common problem.
It is not easy to decide that no country in the same way will be done, even more smaller than Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is inappropriate:
If someone is called a refugee in Serbia, he must fill the documents for this.
And if he doesn't, they will not leave it in the country because it is safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already brought 175 miles to the border with Serbia.
But Orban remains not: he plans to bring the same construction to the border of Romania.
Buharest has already stated that it is incompatible with Peace principles.
Wangellis Meováracis: "Eve wants to help us."
Wangelis Me^rakis has entered a number of years in the right of the Governments, which, in view of the left, have brought the country to the financial crisis.
Now he, who became a temporary leader of the "New Democracy" party, rejects the call of Cyprus.
In a few days before election, he met the journalist.
Mr. Me^rakis, welcome to the Roanus!
Wangellis Me^rakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Ironius: Your party has suffered a disturbing disorder for nine months ago, with the SIRIZA coalition, but now the "New Democracy" has been compared to it.
What changed for that time?
Wangellis Me^rakis: Greece changed, and we too.
Mr. Cyprus lied much in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece was the budget and economic growth.
Now the country has a budgetal deficit and a high level without a deficit.
The investors went out because Mr. Cyprus had lost them.
In the last nine months, the Greek had the opportunity to evaluate the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what happened.
The world's life has become much worse in comparison with January, when the situation has improved, and most of the Greek citizens have fallen.
You're saying that if you're taking a choice, you'll strive to join other partys, including SIRIZ.
Wangelis Me©rakis: The fact is that Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not unfortunate that in all other countries where or still the salvation programmes, the political forces and all governing parties were gathered together in order to establish the programme they agreed without rejecting their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I believe firmly that at the current stage only political forces and institutions will allow the country to go forward.
Ironius: Your party has voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the country's creditors.
If you become a new premier on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
Wangelis Meʹrakis: Actually we have voted for the movement of Greece on Peaceways, because we have a good idea of what lossful consequences the country would bring out of the EU.
Now, our subsidy to farmers for their production helps us, we have solidarity funds, Unker packages and banking sector assistance.
All of this would be lost if there were no agreements with Property.
However, the current measures of the economy have been the result of the negotiation of Mr. Cyprus.
I know it doesn't want to make us.
Property wants to help us.
Thus, if the new Greek Government wants to arrange for the first year, it acts racionally and makes it understand that the country has a strong political will for the implementation of the salvation programme, then I am sure that all the commitments adopted that cannot be fulfilled because they have been brought to the recession may be the subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that we would be able to return to negotiations with our creditors in the first year of the new agreement, since they expect the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue privateness, reforms and structural changes that have been made by continuing to carry out the EU's benefits and large investment opportunities that we need to open for better understanding and cooperation.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus had no serious arguments on many key political issues that we discovered by discussing these issues with our Peace colleagues.
I can bring an example of farmers' income.
We explained to our Peace partners that it was not about the fixed annual income, and that it could not be fully charged before.
We were told that the ministers of Cyprus never spoke about it.
The Greek ministers were not prepared and wrongly informed, so negotiated and concluded an insufficient agreement.
If you win elections, you will soon show one table with Mr. Unker, Oland, Mr. Mercel and other Peace leaders.
Will it be different from what your preacher Antonis Samaras said to them?
Wangelis Me Kapracis: First of all, I will explain to them that until 2014 we were trying to fulfil the 2012 agreement, with an enormous angle of it.
We moved forward to reform.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we were in emergency circumstances.
The risk was fallen, and it was not seen that potential purchasers were ready to pay the price established by the Greek Government.
At that time, I was a parliamentar, and I was able to consider three groups of parliamentary groups, which then composed the Governing majority.
And despite their serious ideological divergence on key law projects, we had a worker Parliament, which is in the presence of peoples and extremists, as well as the mass demonstrations, the outcome.
And we have been able to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the general elections resulting from the presidential elections in December.
Refugee: The last weeks in Greece are moved to the mass flow of refugees.
What are you thinking about this situation, and the reaction of the countries in which these people are seeking?
Wangellis Me^rakis: The crisis with refugees is a bomb of immediate action with which we need to have a business after the victory of elections.
And the reason is that the Government of Syria was not in this situation as follows.
Such questions should be discussed, because if the problem reaches you, there are only emergency measures.
And now we're in such a situation.
Even the temporary Government, which changed Syriz, has made more in seven days than Mr. Cyprus in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the temporary government, which provides a valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, who invited the EU to take a decision.
We need to see how many refugees are to leave the country, and not that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that occurred with them.
This is a deep humanitarian issue, and we will keep on the positions that Peace policy should be adopted in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU themselves, to be taken into the United Nations.
We also need the best coordination of the holdings, more effective border controls and refugee adoption centres.
We should also use effectively the economic assistance we receive from the EU to be able to cope with this constant problem.
Mr. Me^rakis, thank you for the interview.
Wangellis Me^rakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Donekka, the Main Police Management of the Military Area was established and held a suspicious suspicious of the 34-year Ukrainian military servant from the city of Crew Rog (Dnepropetrovation), which was killed at night in the joint use of spikes, and a conflict in the village of the Verhnetoric Jasinowath region of Doneckina had shot out of the car to his opposite.

A man who opened a shot at the Delta State University left a record of excuses
After his friend's shot and murder in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note that he said he "receives" about the first murder and would like "all return", the authorized bodies reported on Thursday.
The police in Gothie, Mississippi, reported that the teacher of geographical and public scientists at Delta's University called for the service of 911 about 10 hours tomorrow.
On Monday, he told me he had shot someone.
Lamb said to the detector that the police needed to send people to him home.
He reported, "I killed my wife yesterday," and he also mentioned that there's a "powder" in the house, which "nobody's crazy," but probably disappointed.
The police was interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shot.
When the police arrived in the crime, the body of Emmy Prentiss, 41, was found there, and written by Lamba's hand, 45 years, in which it was said, "I am sorry to return all back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
By writing a note, Lamb passed 300 miles to the Delta University, where Itana Schmidt, the historian teacher, killed, and evening on Monday, when the police surrounded him, ended with herself.
The director of the University of William Laforge reported that he had no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba was apparently in mind."
Despite the information made on Monday that the Lamb had proposed a role between Prentiss and Schmidt, the office of the service on Thursday reported "the unless any information or evidence of the facts" of "loyal triangle".
Prentiss was a "good man" Shawn O'Stin, who told that he was married to her about seven years.
They were spent 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told him that he and Prentius had a daughter who was 19, and that she was "inconfortable."
He added that Princess and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsey Noules, the newspaper San Gerald calls the close friend Prentiss, after she worked from home via the Internet.
Noules race, that Prentiss had a song on the Laying Click, and that she met Lamb about three years.
Noules said, "He always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called the family at a moment on Monday to say, "He doesn't eat."
On the same night, when the police reached him on the shot "1" near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, sprang out of it, fled into the forest and shot there.
According to the summary located on the University website, Lamb received a degree of the doctor in the field of pedagogics at the University of Delta.
Stars losing their happiness
Actor (left), on a graphy with his son Redmond (right) had been a few difficult years.
In 2001, he had a lakemie, and in 2009 he lost his multi-yearly partnership with Farru Fosset, who died from cancer.
As reported, the actor also suffered from drug dependence, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug protection.
All of this, of course, played his role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United has been released for a few months because of a double break
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Liga Champion's mother, in which Manchester United had lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defendant is concerned about this conduct that will not be able to go out to the field at least six months, Louis van Gall hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The trauma occurred during the unconscious Hector Moreno subcutaneously at the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw was throwing into the PSV Struft zone.
He was helped in the field for nine minutes and gave oxygen before transporting to the hospital.
Van Gall said, "He has a double break, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or later, and then they'll operate.
It's a terrible -- a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcoming great difficulties and playing a tastistic game, and this happened here.
There was a oxygen mask on it.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's six months, and the guy can't play a group.
I hope he'll be able to play again in this season.
Moreno felt that he didn't get a red card and wasn't assigned to the tools.
Arbitr Nikola Riccolly didn't command me to finish.
Van Gall believes that the Italian judge has allowed a mistake.
Just judge yourself when I say that it's worth the penalties and the red card.
It's been a very nice shot of two feet.
In your officer Shaw says, "Thank all for your messages, not to describe how I am devastated, my way to restore begins, I'll return more than I was."
More on the subject: Manchester United is anxious of disaster with Luke Shaw when playing PSV
The english protector will have an additional incentive to address Championat in France in June.
Phillip Coku, PSV trainer, said, "This is a very hard trauma."
When any player gets such a trauma, it's all very confused.
This has never been our players to traumatise the opposite.
Moreno moved his feet by playing for Me against the Netherlands team under the leadership of Van Galla on the Championate of the World 2014.
"He's now very hard, because he hasn't been going to hurt the opposite, and when you hear that it's a very hard trauma, you feel bad," said Coco.
I didn't have the opportunity to see myself.
The only thing I could see is the football that was flying in another direction, so it seemed like he (Morono) was cut it up, but I didn't see the podcast under Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what this is, I know how difficult it is to overcome.
I'm very hard, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was also delivered to hospital after the meeting with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Loracs?
Each parent quickly takes one thing: if your child likes some book, take a little time before you get to know her nearly.
Let's see if you're not David Cameron.
Replying on the question of the representative of the company who is in the Kaniculian Relief Organization, the Prime Minister chose the "Lorax" - a story of the environmental decline written by Dr. Suses in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameroon in a commentary on the SuperCamps website, and he continues: "This is a funny, tremendous, unusual story with a strong message I like to read my →, because there is always a picture or message we miss."
And it would be good, except the last paragraph in which Cameroon, as it is supposed, refers to the contents of the book, but actually tells the question of the single film recorded in 2012, with new persons and details added to diversify a shortly short original report.
"In the high walls of the town of the Universal, where there was no green and even air sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes that the heart of Odri - the girl of her minds, fulfilling her desire to see the present tree," we read in the description of the love story, not the Dr. Suza (the current name of Theodore Susse Gazel), which was dead in 1991.
If this seems inadequately suspicious, the text of Cameron is read almost as a short exhibition of the "Lorax" film, published on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the town of Universumvill, where everything was experienced and even air sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes that the heart of Odri is the girl's mind."
It seems little likely that Cameron, by general recognition, is a active parent, so unknown with the content of the book that the boy does not named, knows how the surrounding envelope of trees and the boyfriend of Nahavkins, despite the protest of Loracs (which is the name of the book) is a funny §a with all that "speaks on the name of the trees".
Probably, such an unfortunate PR task was assigned to the artist, never reading the child a book on Lorax 20 times.
The representative of Duning-Strit stated that the text was previously received from the Cameron Office in the electoral area.
The SuperCamps company confirmed that the text was received from Cameron station, but the following comments did not follow.
For Adam Lita, it was evident that the risk was not to fall into the congregation of England, but this is still a complicated question
The victory of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a simple task, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the repeat of a test series of 3 to 0, which has happened last time, I am not probably.
I wouldn't have excluded the winning in my field.
Alister Kuka's command may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are players, virtually taking bottles, and collective thoughts; they will not bring to themselves scrambs from 2012, but only a young position.
With Moen Ali's sword, it is converted into a bowler that gives the wooden bottles, and Adyl Rashid, even if it is not a test level figure, it is an attacking option.
On the other hand, Adam Lit went out from the congregation of England on the test cricket and was replaced by Alex Hayes
The decision to exclude Adam Lita is difficult to analyze me, his main trainer in Yorkshire.
At his seven tests, two good attacks were made in complex conditions, and it was evident, but cruel, that the cricket players were evaluated by judges.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to that declaration, because (and I said this before) players are best chosen to themselves.
A couple is half, and Lita could wait for a more continuous career, but he was in the power of his own judgment.
We hope that if he's going to have more won for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The main council trainer of England, Trevor Bailes, was well aware of his nature, even when he did not do what he could, and it won't hurt me; he's primarily a commander, and then it's all the other.
A question of how long it has been before the test cricket bears an impression of itself is a complex question.
Lit played in seven games, like the Robson, before him, and Nick Compton is at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on a strange field.
The only thing you could be pleased is that England chose Jonathan Trot for the Caribbean Premier Liga when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity was already in the past.
There's Alex Halls, and he's a Bethsman that I appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricketist that we saw in the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he was 236 in a murder against us on the Trend Bridge area, which was already something.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but it will, of course, depend on the set of the team in the OAE.
The idea of putting Mona near Cook as an open bathsman, which would give the possibility to introduce an additional sniper, keeping four speed bowlers, thinks, and I'm not totally contrary to it.
I don't see the reasons why the fucking player can't throw the ball out there, and this leftman has already shown that he's a good cricketist.
Moen may not really needs for his Wustershire, but the third number for them, and there's no great difference here.
My old companion by the team of Justin Langer played its first 38 testmates "the third baseman" before it was opened in 2001.
He wined a triple of three hundred and didn't look at it.
Zafar Ansari comes to the collection as a reserve-spinner, and in my inconsistent society, he showed me a very promised young man.
People can look at his exemplary statistics - in the average 31 bits and 35 with the sword - and think that it is a risked tax, but among the "for" songs, and the electors have chosen youth.
He'll learn much about this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a couple of training supplements.
The designation of Mahela Jawordin, the Sri Lanka Besman, as a testmatter, could be a mastery.
He is one of the best guys for the game that will bring the richest experience that has been received under all conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white bottle is used, and it provides energy as well as an unfortunate temperature in the stage.
I always felt that he was born to be ensured in international crickets, whether game or training, and, like Mah, he is a great intellectual.
Sometimes new votes in the divorce, even if they say what has been said before, new forces may be given to the team.
College Colly on Darham Ben Stokes team has been left for a single day, Ruth has made an analogue break in relation to Australia, and I, for example, do not experience the problem.
Although not all of this, the trainers and the player's electors do not determine the design.
And you must remember how players, their position depends on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The Lager of British outcome parties from the United Kingdom can win if the economy is in depression until 2017
The non-production policy of David Cameron on the renewal of negotiations on the maintenance of Britain in the EU each day tests more complex, even without the choice of geneal Jeremy, "It's right or not?"- Corbine by the leader of the laborators or TUC's distortion on the conduct of the TUC on Thursday.
Foreigners also have their Corbines and Faradži's Naizels.
The Friendly Diplomatic explained in days that in the situation in which the EU is currently concerned with various crisiss, not all of them is their own manufacture - some countries-participants of the British Ego-Ego-Agenda's headquarters are increasing and deteriorating agreements that they do not want.
When meetings in Britain at an annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not want them anyway if they distorted the protection.
We could even call that "Shelph Dave and George's program."
The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are catastrophed at the same and bilateral sessions in foreign hundreds, and are graphed on the background of the memory, in the company's interest, or without it, and then come home and say they are attached to the Unions to reform.
It's all about me.
My Friend, who wants interested in supporting the external contacts in Britain, "Do not leave us together with France," says Berlin - is that the defensed ministers and offices come to understand in some hundreds of times when they are still in the same way, we will stay or leave.
Angle Mercel, the very east officer of Germany, is an alien, but she is at the authority of 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation will be disappointed, as it has been disappointed to sit on its existence of Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Cola (16).
The Chapter of France François Oland stands before the election or replaced in 2017.
He also loses power.
Poland can receive the nationalist government of the right to it, Spain is the left.
It was hard to see those out of the skin to help "self-Britts" whose energy could be affected for the prevention of Scotland out of the United States - which they do not want, because most of the same separatisist trends are similar.
So some of these ministers can even plan outcome in the SNP style during the reference campaign in Britain in 2017 to improve the outcome process from the EU, my friend.
"Review was a fixed idea" and "Brittanny has not received anything valuable from the renewal of negotiations."
Others know what Flit Street can be, and as the EU's media-nate is skeptically set up, in contrast with the time of Tony Benn Referencendum in 1975, which supported our introduction in 1973, proportion 2:
They may be proud to remember Boris Johnson, a covered portfolio, who celebrated his "righteous bananas" of the Brussels Correspondence at the beginning of the 1990s.
By all his stupidity, Ed Milliban knew who was his enemy.
They included a pearl company from the fearing taxes of juices, telephone hackers and psycho non-residents, which possess most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same opinion about them, but he reported to you that when you're in a cell with a big gorilla, you should give her the bananas so that you can't eat you on a boat and again with a tea.
In fact, Milliband was a great companion of Blair than itself, in the opposite of Cameron's idea of referency, since Blair did the principles of the EU's refused constitution, buried by French and Netherlands electors in 2005, which gave him a winner ticket.
The press didn't forgive him anything of that.
But the dear Jeremy Corbin, who friendly shot me on the winter in Westminster on Monday, I told him that he had no time to treat him on me -- it seems like it's risking to repeat the Nile Kinock "Merdock" from the 80th, a mistake and then, and now.
This may take time, but he must have to describe the effects of the interaction with the pressure - not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on which he was sitting on Sunday.
The official position of Corbine on Property is that I delicately call evolution.
He says that he wants us to remain in the reformed EU.
In fact, most people under the traditional trends of Ukip and a widespread circle of "Small England Sites" among two may probably say "yes".
It's the same thing as Hillary-"Benne, but not Bennitt"-Benne said on the radio and TV this week, and his internal battle from all forces refused to admit that the designation of the Corbine of an unfortunate John's Donnella's "thee" financial minister was a bad idea.
It took me about the 70s when his older father of all forces was on TV for unloyality to the Leaborist office colleagues, without going too far and losing his post in the Minister's office.
The Hillari bit was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "in any circumstances" is Benna's phrase - not what he said, Donnel, and not what J. K. said to the parliament and members of the parliament at the private meeting on Monday evening.
In order to report the democracy and the "Heir" Corbin there - remember, he has even dressed me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of seven weekly television, especially in the waterway networks, including the paranoid and the pre-specificity.
It is not to give Kiertor so easy to be able to take him as a pleasant support for the libarists during the reference campaign, as Donnel said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that.
However, the main distortion of Donnel and Corbine on the EU membership - in the context of the "benitic" economy - is no longer the issue of the exoter-discussion among the left-handed dissidents, for which narcissism is a central principle in dogmatics.
What is deceived by Nato Tom Watson's offences is that J.K. will not agite for the outcome - foreign diplomats will be able to try to bring it to their own homes.
Why would Paris or Berlin treat the political capital - they also have a doubt about the choices - to the attack of the United States, when all of this could be uncertain?
The United States have already been completely disappointed by the British military actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even while the Government of the second authorities has distorted the costs I have been made on Monday during a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of the Electronic Cigaretes from Public Health England
Declarations of the Government of the Agency that the 95 per cent electron cigarettes were less than the fucking, were held at the meeting of 12 persons, some of whom the tabacco industry was reported as the researchers reported.
Experts in British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet discovered the evidence of the facts used by the Public Health England Agency (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
The PHE explained the important report of the "Return Affairs" last month, called it "to-second review of evidence".
However, some researchers doubted the validity of data and showed some experts with tabacco industry.
In the editing article in the Medical Journal Lancet, the last month had been discovered by the " extremely appealed evidence" on which the PHE had built its main conclusion.
In the article BMJ, two other researchers have questioned whether these statements are " solid or increasing".
Martin Ky, professor of the Health Organization at the London Hygiene and the Medical Trop, and Simon Capwell, the Clin Epidemiology Teacher at the Liverpool University, reported: "The foundation of health principle must be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
According to their words, the public expects the PHE statements that "the current best" shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less than tabacocuration" to be able to reflect evidence and modelisation.
In fact, this is held from the only meeting of 12 persons, which will be gathered for the multicriteria analysis model to make decisions to report their opinions about the different non-containing products; the results of the meetings are shortly brought to scientific performance.
KY and Capwell reported that one of the sponsors was a company called Euroswiss Health, which reported the Director-General that he had previously received an independent investigation from British American Tobacco.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the field of health care in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced that the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes had not mentioned that he had received from the Philip Morris tabacco company before.
There was no comprehensive interpretation of the election of members of the Council, but there are several electron cigarette parties among them, some of whom also stated the Implementation of Industry in PIA.
It is not possible whether other participants have experienced the management experience in the Taviz case.
The meeting was also visited by the tabacco holder in the PHE.
The Scientific article "contracted by the group" is "increasingly agreed" that there is a lack of "the evidence of the effects of most of the criteria," wrote Ki and Cappel.
However, no of these links and practices were included in the PHE report.
KY and Capwell have said that the PHE statements that "no evidence is at present that electronic cigarettes are the way that leads children or non-runners to fucking," I have been temporarily.
Professor Kevin Fenton, who was a health and well-being holder in the PHE, said that BMJ statements had already been answered before.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are less than tabacocuration."
One of the two pigs died throughout his life.
All evidence of the fact that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are compared to small, but we need to continue to examine remote consequences.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform publicly that they do not prove and do not prove that these performances were, especially where PIA had doubts about the behavior of a risk in comparison with the tabac.
Approximately 80,000 people per year die from the diseases of smoking, and the NHS fucking is 2 billion pounds per year.
Clearly, it is evident that, although electronic cigarettes and I are not safe, they are only a part of the fucking, we do our tasks before the nation.
Early Chapter Channel 4 believes that BBC has to stop the EastEnders series
The former Chapter of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop the exhibition of programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noted that their business competitors would give much of their successful shows as the "Albert Placement".
Johnson noted that license collections should be used only to create such programmes that are not released by other British television companies.
He expressed BBC criticism because the company puts the transmission of a public meeting, which is probably only a small part of the auditorium, for an eight-year period when competitors go a show with high rating, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director-General BBC Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with others, Johnson noted that he had tried to cooperate with BBC for six years during the work of Channel 4.
"I can't be able to think that BBC will prepare and translate transfers that could be shown to competitive companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the members of the Committee on the Communications of the Lord Palace in the context of the clearing of the BBC's further judgment.
If you keep a license collection that I do not consider a good decision in the average and long-term period, the company should only leave the programmes that are not released or will not be released by other companies.
Shaw The Voice goes out in the airport, because creators want to get the maximum support for the future.
The idea that no one would make it anymore, is funny and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; generally they are their own production.
Other channels, of course, would give a lot for it.
I don't understand how this might be a public consultation.
I don't think it'd be low to BBC.
The serial undertaking of Johnson, heading Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, claimed BBC to follow the reviews "from the ambs and because of their faith that this is the best way to provide support for the period."
His comments on the most popular shows on BBC are addressed by the Executive Director of Sky Tony Boll, who in his memory-lection of Tagagart in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed BBC to sell series of type EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the lower transmissions of the BBC of the public character "continue going to BBC4, where it is often to evaluate the auditorium, but therefore the company's function has been completed, and that can be declared as an argument in the Canadian preachers that correct the income from licensing collections in 4 billion pounds: "No, of course, we do all these unintelligible transfers that no one does."
They're putting them into a shot where no one's going to look at them.
As a result of the license collection, Johnson reported to the Committee more, "I call you to find a more regressive system in the case of who most of it will receive.
Of course, you all think we're all thinking that 150 pounds per year are a great amount, but for people whose 150 pounds are great money, I'm interested, they think so because they don't look and listen to BBC.
The former Executive Director of the Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also expressed before the Committee on the last Thursday, said that BBC should review the Rita mission with the use of "inform, broadcast and distraction".
He noted that now only a substantial part of BBC materials are classified as educated - according to it, it is 1% of the TV and 0.1 per cent per radio - and that the company must take the initiative of Australia and Canadian visiting companies under "inform, broadcast and distraction".
The partnership of Elstein noted that the BBC should apply more efforts in such areas as the "Advanced Concerts" (only part of them, as it said, is on TV) and to enter into the alliances with commercial facilities in order to make them available for the online review.
"Sonogenetic" allows brain cells to be managed by sound wings
The videograph shows how the novels change the direction of the movement at the time they are undertaken by the exercise of audio impulses.
Scientists have produced a geneticly modified nervous system that can be managed using sound wings issues.
Small inflammation changes the direction of the movement at the time they operate by sound impulses, too high to hear the ear.
Impulses benefit from the activation of neurons, geneticly modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasucture wings.
More about: Researchers govern the brain activities by means of light
Scientists have told that red is demonstrating the possibility of a new method called "sonogenetic", which is involved in the use of ultraxucs to raise certain cells of brain, hearts and mouse, whereas the source of ultraxuc is available outside the body.
Srikant Chalassani, scientist in the Institute of So, La Haya, California, told Guardian that this method could once replace the deep stimulation of the brain - an invasive procedure in which electric impulses are sent in the human brain and is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Red-nematodes are usually not responsible for ultrasounds, but Chalassani discovered that they began to react when they were placed in a milk of microscopic puzzles.
He discovered that the puzzles strengthen the ultrasuccessful waves that then occur in the red organism.
Increased ultraschool walls operate on structures called TRP-4 channels, found in the membranes of some red cells.
Ultraduceous waves provide these channels to open and raise cells that are with them, reported in the Nature Communications report.
For the creation of non-rooms that can be managed through the Ultraxuc, Chalassani made genetic modes of red, so their movement of neurons ispose TRP-4 channels.
During the use of Ultraduct for the effect of modifying organs, audio wheels strengthened microscopic puzzles and were introduced into red bodies by enabling modified neuron motors.
This method is like that applied in "optogenetic" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and disable neurons using light impulses.
Chassani states that in comparison with this method of sonogenetic may have some advantages.
In contrast to the light that is sufficient to the appropriate part of the brain on the volatile, low-frequent ultraviolet wings are increasingly passed through the body's weight, so they do not need to pass within the steel box.
"We believe that to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genetic and therapeutic viruss will be able to make neurons sensitive to the Ultraducus signal," said Chalassani.
He added that the method may be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

However, the special campaign also leads to the immediate occurrence of autobus residues and meters that need to see them again.
"The major declaration of the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by the fonts of the London metro with the image of the DLR line that turns into the dance force.
In September of this year, a multitude of DLR traders will burn on the DLR line. Passages ask for help to interrupt weapons.
300 posts are drawn by artists who have made their work in the "Mouse of Hard Design" in the Ben's Park "Dismalend".
A collection called the "Personal Patrol" group helped to distribute them in London by using the "scale of the reklams rubber", a 6-pound key set, which, as stated, "awards access to the third of the reklame space on the busy residues of the planet."
Londres transporters did not have such "vandalism" in the form of non-saturated posts.
One of the parental declarations issued by the "Personal Panel Group".
According to Gavin Greendon, the exhibition kurator of the designs and teacher at the Essex University, artists become more needs and seek to bring political experiences to the auditorium for galeries.
Many artists start working with protest movements activists, understanding that they have to go into real world for their experience if they want to affect society.

Amnesty's video was viewed more than 100 000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the VCCP worker pro bono, with the graphic designer and sound artist, also working freely.
The Creative Director VCCP Me · Lever was deceived by an advertising tissue around the exCel exhibition - and said, "Let's build them a campaign they're trying to escape."
They thought to create a more structural and hytroumic corporate advertisement, but "filling her house with light flowers and animations became more emphasising."
"They have greatly helped us to focus on the sale of illegal torture equipment on exhibition," said Tom Davis from Amnesty.
Now we need that the Government of the United Kingdom take measures and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold directly at our time.
Perhaps the most creative experience in the exhibition of inflation and inside ExCeL, where the participants trade `evfemes' production.

Eight Golden Rules of Life in Students
Age 11 years since I moved to the student society as a normal 19-year-old man who still believes in Âtea and morality, but now I just remember the laughing of those I have disappointed - and many, long complaints on others.
In particular, what I learned, it is possible to set up the eight simple rules.
Transfers to society may be broken from the low-leaving to the absolutely scared.
He encourages people to talk: tell people from where you took an academic delay and where you made it, whether you support Corbin and why you "respected, loved, neither hate "Marmaith" because, seriously, you guys, it's just a hard extract of Hahahahaha, I'll be with myself."
Shut up.
And help others to rest - ask questions and demonstrate interest.
This supports you and helps you to find people you like, not those with whom you would not even have been talking, even if you had a cup of fire, and they would have spent the firemakers.
Let's make people space.
The people's spots are often converted into drinking, powder films, and general tubes, but they are also the place where people are clothing and running downer whites.
More about: Don't even think to start learning at the university in the fields
Introverts at universities are injusticed.
Your horse must be a fugitive, but many communities form a culture of sharing from one committee to another, which contributes to friendship, society and friendship.
This may be a spirit for someone who is trying to restore powers.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to come with you, but I need you to go, and I got to restore the energy I've made to communicate with you."
Try to feel when the concubine is deceived by the community, not to screw to him, but to send SMSs.
Instead, about the fuck: do this.
One guy in my community followed the principle: If the door was not closed, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Drive friends with winning.
Because you're starting a university life on the population of the Bake-Off show, you're running into the door of people to take a shock-shooled swimming, it's not so strange, it's not likely to remind them in the 1950's, "Good to see, we're sitting, I've got something to you, and now you're laughing, and I'll give you some different questions."
It's a good way to join the household.
The neighbors will feel that they have to talk to you, and then your face may be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
It's badly blinded muckles, sugars and grass that make people sleeping when you're going to go to them.
Eating hair is a typical crime in students.
Of course, the adoption of some kitchen is a steel, but is it a furniture to take a little bit of milk for the tea?
The right is the owner of the milk.
He's probably going to offer you not to be disappointed, even if there's anger inside.
If someone hurts your things, it's disgraced, and I'm feeling you, but try to take this adulter than my neighbor who puts in his milk of milk for the meat to defeat those who took him without a question.
Now she'll be in.
You don't have to produce a sound that will mislead people to sleep or learn.
Not only to be a personal person but also because you are the most people of the talk about the households.
The girl in my corner asked the neighbor to add the sound of the bathroom and the base-gitary, because there were three hours tomorrow, and she had an exam tomorrow.
In response to the neighbor, he increased the volume.
When the end was silent at the fiveth morning, she allowed him to sleep two hours, and then cut off her door and closed her back to a three-hour test.
Didn't it be romantic if your future husband would live in the same society as you?
Instead, it would not be extremely, before the cup of rocks, unlike if you were taking a neighbor for your future wife, torching them, and should have seen it every day, and maybe watching how he draws all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you're not going to tell the guardian, but if the warm neighbor is not exactly your future husband, try to be low to cold your own drunk.
At that worrying moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside his own closed comma, the bridge between the throat and the throat is tougher than it is.
It's funny, but it's turning into its opposite in a number of seconds.
Give a valuable and interesting lesson on security, hiding something, but never stick to a tear and a shampoon.
Close the strange door and put the keys in the water stack that you're putting in the wheel -- but don't shoot the strange stuff with Blu-Tack to more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operational system on iPhone after Apple is released
A new operational system can be requested by entering the Settings application, select General and then - Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to spring and install it.
The problems occurred after the establishment of an error report that said to them that "the renewal of the annex failed."
To avoid this, users are recommended or expected until they are silent or trying to renew it via iTunes.
The phone suggestions allow you to pass the whole process until the end.
The process may include the elimination of applications to enhance the free space - but Apple may minimise the probability of this action, reducing the renewal and facilitating the implementation of a special tool that will be able to remove the applications and repeat them after the process was completed.
It is necessary to be sure that your phone is loaded or close to the loading device so that the battery is not allowed.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating because the phone call in the process can lead to the renewal.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
The U.S. Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
His opinion, the military support, which Moscow provides to President Asad, is only for conflict.
At the same time, the Chapter of the White House is going to talk about this to the Russian colleague, PJ Media.
The Secretary of the United States John Kerry called the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia Sergei Lavrov to discuss the military activity of Russia in Syria.
This reports from PJ Media.
"Kerry's secretary clearly understands that the further support of President Asada from Russia creates a risk of warning and proliferation of conflict, as well as negatively refers to our common goal - to combat extremism - if we also do not continue to look for the way of the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of authority," said the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Kerry had highlighted the commitment of the United States to combat the " Islamic State" in the context of coalition from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Ased would never be her member.
Furthermore, the United States will "rejoice with Russia's active role in trying to resist the "Islam State".
At last Friday, the representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what Russian army in Syria did, but Washington was going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, the press secretary of the White House J° Ernest noted that the time for the phone between President Barack Obama and the Russian leader Vladimir Putin until he said, "When the president decides that the phone with the President Putin poi for our interests, then he will raise the trumpet and try to make this call."
Sam Barak Obama considers Russia's decision to increase the support of Asa's regime by "progressivity".
I remember our ability with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that the next support of Asada would only hurt the situation.
"But he didn't listen to my warnings - and the situation was injured," said the President of the United States.
Importable jackets will be released from the payment of tissues.
Mineconomen development is to be temporarily released by importable jackets and other floating instruments for repair and payment of taxes and taxes.
The relevant changes in the series of legendary goods for temporary free imports were prepared by the Ministry of the Government of the FE.
The "Isnotes" reported that the Minister for Economic Development of Elena Laskin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev on the outcome of the Crym has ordered a series of campaigns - Mineconstruction, Centrance RF, Mincultures, MID, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for the establishment of pleasure for the Iaching in the neighbouring areas of the country.
In their own way, experts note that the main problem is the full lack of infrastructure for saving, service and content of jackets.
The Governors prefer to keep their courts outside the border - approximately $200 million each year are going to the penalty of the Peace States for the content, reparation and service of jackets.
Russia's Mine-Environment prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Asian Economic Commission " On the introduction of changes to the Revision of the goods imported temporarily with full-conditional freedom from payment of taxes, taxes for the imported jackets and other floating reliefs.
According to the Ministerial Opinion, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favourable developments in the country's neighbouring areas,” noted Laskina.
The question was addressed to consider the sub-Commission on the Tamogen-Tarif, non-Artific regulation, protected measures in the external trade of the Governing Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which was now held in September, and was also approved by the consequences of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Mineco-Environment, the full-conditional exemption measure is in its own debt.
Therefore, after the session of the subcommission meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation of Mineconvex, the Commission of the Asian Economic Committee for the discussion with the EFTA Member States will introduce a proposal, explained Laskina.
Importable goods that are completely released from payment of the taxes, are included in goods for the consequence of external activities and international cooperation, for the use of scientific, culture, cinematographic, and tourism, for international assistance, and in the middle of them are an employee equipment (personal computers, writers), controls, oral equipment, scenical costs, and decoration, preliminary laboratories, water lips, holiday cars, motors, books, journals, instruments and objects for religious equipment.
In the Press Service, the Mintrands RF "Isnotes" reported that the commitments were prepared on the Carci, Sevastopol, Julty, Pheodose and Patories on the seaport, which provide a simplified order for the west and the outcome of small, parozed and cross-border vessels.
The Centre has given the order for the capital of the Sea ports of Crime to ensure the application of a simple Â occupation of small, →perusian and circulated vessels in the sea port and the outcome of the numbered vessels from the sea port.
The Centre has also prepared projects of the RF Government on the Enlargement of the Aquatorium of the Crime Seaports.
As regards Jalta and the Feodocy of the displacement already adopted, the rest of the stage of the employment is noted in the press-service of knowledge.
According to the Ministers, Mrs. Advisor, Class and Intelligence, Mr Secretary of Small Courts used for non-Communities, the Republic of Crym and Sevastopol should be addressed.
The problem is that in Russia it was extremely difficult to join just because of the developed infrastructure.
If you look south of Italy and France, this is the whole continuous development industry in which a large number of people has been entrusted.
However, in Russia, everything is actually worth it.
Our lively little-interessed, the only cow where you can exploit the jackets is the Black Sea in the region of Sochi, Helendjika, Norwegian, Ana.
But it is greatly difficult to be that there are extremely strong rules for the border service in this area: to get out of the jacket, we need to form a mass of permits.
Moreover, inside Russia, you're even going to go somewhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel and then rise up the problem to take it, says the Sell Director of Normarine Denise Novikov.
What is going on to keep the jackets, there are now special angaries for a jack up to 30 years in Moscow and Sankt Petersburg. The jackets also are assigned to preserve to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the yacht buyers were rich people, but with the beginning of the crisis, the jacket question was decreased.
The World Bank granted Ukraine $500 million.
The World Bank adopted a new business project for Ukraine by $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This has been reported to the international organization's press service.
"The new implementation will support a number of priority measures for reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," states the report.
The Director of the World Bank on Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Zimao Fain stated that the reforms of the banking sector would help to restore credits in real economy and to stimulate the reconstruction of economic growth.
He also noted that Ukrainian authorities had adopted impressive steps on the reform of the economy and the World Bank to monitor the first characteristics of stability.
But because of the serious problem of Fan, the Government of Ukraine calls for reforms.
The former Polish Government approved the delivery of credit in EUR 100 million in Ukraine, transmitting " RIA News".
They ask to create transgender blocks from there.
At the Joint Council of the Federal Penalty Service (FIN) on the protection of the rights sentenced in October 2015, including other issues, will discuss the possibility of establishing separate blocks for transgenders and translators.
The "Islaims" reported the member of the Council of Vladislav Grib.
It considers that, depending on the total number of convicted in Russia, no determination of sex, the camera, blocks, or even (if so many criminals will be) could be provided for a special provision for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Gryb stresses that the determination of the penalty of citizens in such isolated places is possible only after the convictions of the relevant medical experts, which will prove that the criminal is actually a person who identify himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Gryb assured that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the security of penalty.
According to his statement, the issue has successfully worked over the road: the SISO (which is before the decision of the court) provides the cameras for transgenders and the correctional institutions are special blocks.
Today, this is the only outcome of the crimes with such criminals.
They must be exclusively isolated, since the presence of transporters and transgenders in normal cameras is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and sea problems for FSINs.
The reduction of trading from the cameras is guaranteed, says Vladislav Gryb.
On the basis of the great city, the number of criminals with an undetermined field must also be calculated where to distribute them.
SIZO is not exactly needed, just cameras, blocks in the areas.
Yes, a separate Property is if the transgenders will be a lot.
As Gryb explained, there may be 50 or 100 persons in the block, and if a specialized body is created in Russia one, the penalty of prison transsexuals will be made out of any region.
The citizens are in the AIDS on the end of the crime, so the income of transviews or transgenders from other subjects in the course of follow-up and judicial process is unreal, and this is the introduction of such a question for those already convicted in the AIDS - yes, - says Greebe.
On the other hand, the right-guarding bodies were not able to determine the following isolator of man or woman - to determine the detained for the preservation of drugs of 24-year-old transsexual Dmitria Kozukov (Alina Davis), which was not arrested by a man with a girl's outermost.
He's been released home under a signature of the unusual.
This news was broadly discussed in relevant networks and MMEs, since there is no longer a mechanism for transgenders in the SISO and Russia.
The Russian legislator, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, geys, bisexuals, transsexuals) supported Nicolay Alexeev the idea of creating special characters for transgender punishment, noted that there was also a possibility of definition of people in the existence of men or women, depending on their own desire.
As a result of the atmosphere in Russia, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but the problem exists as well as the issue of security for homosexuals, says Alexander.
The prisons should be safe, therefore, where blocks could be made in behalf of this and for homosexuals, more than transgenders.
In addition, Alexandria doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who will be prepared for trans-exuals in order to fall in different than the ordinary terms.
Of course, medical studies can be introduced before placing people in the area of transgenders, but not always is the same.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners of Chelsea Menning looked like a man and already stated that he wanted to change the pool, said Alexander.
A man can feel someone nice.
But until there is no department to be punished for transgenders, I doubt that the people will think seriously about the safety of such people and avoid the exactness of their orientation or the semi-idant.
At the same time, the Expert on Reproductive Health on the RF Boris Lordkipanide noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transsexuals-criminals in the province could be very deteriorated by the beginning of the penalty.
The Commission believes that this is the question of sexuality, psychiatrists are being observed, and it is not one test based on high-detailed conclusions.
Today psychiatric opportunities allow it.
Therefore, before the change of half potential, patients have always passed such expertise - they say exactly whether there is an interruption with the surgery of the necessary measure, says Lordkipanide.
However, it is difficult to meet how to introduce this system to the convicted, for the average month is going to this investigation.
The doctor, despite the overall idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubts that in the current economic conditions, it would be intended to provide resources for building new places, medical experts, transgenders in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate that there is no official statistics, but if you consider that the homosexuals in Russia are about 5 per cent, it can be said that the transgenders are less, and those who have such rejection and are still committing crimes are not significant quantities, " said Lordkipanide.
Now before the administration of homosexuals, transgenders, and so they can get the conditions of content.
Michael Antipo won the Yorkian world championat on shachmates.
In Hanti-Mansiski, the world campaign has been completed in the midst of the years to 20 years.
The front of the primary was more than intriguous.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and the Russian Michael Antipo, who still was sorrowing to deal with Jana-Chistof Dudu, which would likely go to the title.
The winning girls celebrated the Ukrainian shock of Natalia Bux.
The Championate of the peace on shachmates that passed from September in Hanty-Mansiska, already in the middle of the tourist distant, seemed to have lost almost all the intriguing, since the representative of Poland Jan-Chistof Duda, who has issued a series of four victories (switzerland systems in 13 tours), had certainly taken leadership.
Since Duda was a primary rating fabric, and it is considered one of the most promising young shocks, the probability that he would lose the obtained destruction was totally insignificant.
And even when Duda adds the travels and allowed Michail Antipo to reduce the distance to 0.5 balls, he remained evident in the fight against the title.
For Antipo was necessary to win the leader in the 13th tour.
But it wouldn't even help, win Duda's party.
Moreover, this commitment of winning, of course, could be said to the Russian shak games and to bring to an unnecessary error.
Fortunately, Michael Antipo was able to escape them.
He was certain of Francesco Rabbaldi, and then he had to wait when his party ended Duda, who met Benjami Bok.
Happy for Antipo's Polish Shak was the contrary to the Netherlands.
Thus, Antipo and Duda took the same number of points - 10 of 13, but the best additional indicators were in Antipo.
That is why the leader of the Hanty-Mansie's autonomous district, whose Governor Natalia Commarov, traditionally gives great attention to the development of shammat in the region, has given a major premium.
And this is not the case of girls intriguing the consequences.
The tourist leader Natalie Buxe (Ukrainian) was enough to not lose the last tour that she had done.
Thus, the winning of the Rossian Alina Bill did not allow her to touch Bux.
The Russian sportsman remained the second with the delay of the campaign at 0.5 balls.
It changes the regional structure.
The Company units the Privalge and Ural regions in one broken Wald-Ural region, Siberia and the Next East region in the East region.
The project will be completed until 1 November.
As the Vipelcom's director Michael Slobodin said, changes are made to "be a strong market player" to develop the company "in new, not always pleasant external conditions".
In the interview of the phone channel, Mr. Slobodin stated that they were to reduce the "10 percent" of the staff in Russia.
78 Moscow clusters Burger King checked and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the Restaurant on the Wolokolam Chase was traffed on 50 thousand rubs, and the arrest on the Grand Tull Street was closed for 90 weeks, but renewed after all the violations were removed.

In this year, the Association of Russian managers "Top-1000 Russian managers" study is 16 times.
As a tool for the professional reputation of Russian leaders of high-eshelon, the investigation underlines the results of the work of Russian managers for a year by detecting leaders in adults and functional directions.
The leading puzzle of candidates consists of the laureates of the last year.
The winners of the past year would be to confirm their participation as a candidate to the current year's rating and to submit members of their Governing Team.
Furthermore, each of the candidates involved in the original list will be moved to ten new managers of other companies, which would be eligible to add to the general puzzle of candidates.
Possible exhibition of the functional directions of the company: Financial Director, Commercial Director, Market Director, Personal Director, IT Director, Public and Corporational Relations Director, Authority Board, Corporation Management Director.
Each of the experts proposed by the manager is invited to participate in the review and is given the opportunity to deal with its management team and to ten new members of other companies.
The exhibition of candidates on adult principle is based on the Classificator of Explorer Association: Innovation technology, commercial banks, forest and forestry industry, mediabizness, metalurgia, multiprofiles, services, freight and telecommunications, services and consumer goods production, assurance, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceutical, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.

At the meetings of expert committees, all wishing candidates are invited to the current year's rating candidates and several times of the previous years.
The Commission is organized by a functional mark: the Committee on the Response of the Higher Rulers and Eight Committees on the Rule of Functioning Guidelines.
At expert committees meetings it is to approve the alphabetically presented boxes (the sites are maintained strictly in the Internet evaluation and I have been closed before the rating process) or to update their corrections to the responsibility of reserve candidates.
The names of the company are given in accordance with Rusian rules and standards " E".
At the time of the rating, the status of managers and companies has changed.
A comfortable tax for investment is 10-13 per cent.
By assessing experts, the credit market for small and medium business in January-April of the current year was 40 per cent.
What, according to your assessments, is the situation today?
After the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, the SMB credit amount was significantly decreased.
The reason is understandable: a rare increase in rates.
A credit under 25-30 per cent of the year was not worth anybody.
If the earlier bank could put all its problems in the next, from the time to the noise, it is now not possible to do: taxes and so clouds.
The current SME credit rates for business is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is not acceptable in view of their occupation.
The rate of 10-13 per cent would allow business to invest in a broad range of projects and to form it.
How much, according to your evaluations, is the question of the credit operators?
After the decrease of the BC percentage, the situation was a little improved.
Credit resources have become more available.
However, we observed that the customers followed a lot of credits.
Firstly, business does not understand its development and future incomes.
Today, the business is one outcome: it is necessary to learn to work by orienting today's economic situation in the country and in the region.
It is needed to follow the current results and control the movement of the resources.
At the same time, financial resources should be used for new technologies that allow modernization of equipment, reduction of production and energy insurance losses.
All of this, finally, allows the company to make the production more competitive and to maintain business even in an instable economic situation.
What main trends of the SMEs' credit market will be strengthened and affected by its development until the end of 2015?
Will the rates change?
The prognoses for the reduction of the average rate in many will depend on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator now demonstrates the consequences of reduction of the key rate.
However, the radical fall of credit prices for SMEs should not be expected.
In the present situation, firstly, the problem is an inflation that makes the needed increased percentage rates in order to gain real income.
Furthermore, the value of money in Russia remains high even when the CB is reduced.
In terms of time, the traditional small and medium-sized business company, as well as in the possibility of compliance of money and economic behavior correction, will certainly be a major risk for creditors.
I wouldn't have been waiting for an annual reduction of the share of bad credits.
Basic reason is the sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and characteristic mode.
That is exactly what Mazda says by Japanese hierogliphs.
Beautiful, laconic and simultaneously complex for those who used to the cyrillic or latin.
And the new CX-5 crosshover as well as any other model of marks: without surprise, an attractive outside, technically completed inside.
The Japanese has already simply been able to show the commitment to the products of the country's rising up to the state of full attention.
How pleasant it may be to bring arguments to the benefit of machines from other countries, and even in principle of these arguments, but the whole conversation will occur from the final phrase: "But this is the Japanese car!
That's what you're talking about!
Such people may have to love not only the technology but also the other Japanese.
Citizens from Base's hole, carrying the vessab, collecting the catastrophes and clothing your friend is not, not in the kimone, of course, but on the canons of Japan's private mode: good, creative and totally unexpected.
Please, the Japanese School is the only one that the Japanese carries with pleasure and after the school.
It has wonderful qualities: simultaneously and emotionally, and strong.
And what older is, it's a bitch.
The main change in the outside of CX-5 is a radiator remote with five horizontal lines.
But where it changes the shape of the car with a new picture of a far and backwards, the car is currently known in the stream of cars.
Like before, Mazda CX-5 looks very cool.
The syluet is harmonious, the forms are sensitive, but the outside has a stream.
It's not going to be called by the field.
CX-5, one of the most safe worldwide, can only be experienced by a hundred Japanese peace.
The design engine provides a high rolling moment in the broad range.
In this case, the fuel cost of this engine is only compiled by the power of 1.75 U.S. only 5.9 L. The power aggregate is compiled by the automatic transmission and full-level.
Black bottles, black bottle, black bottle...
To add to this image a little black humor, you can choose the guiness with a Prince from the No Cross Police Lent.
Moreover, Mazda has applied to the effort that you do not have your own DTP in the CX-5 role.
In order to increase comfort by maintaining the different governance, the subways have been overcome to the action of front and back amortizators and to optimize the form of the low-screen plug-ins.
The full device system is adapted under Russian conditions.
The rain level of the road and the high speed is decreased by 13 per cent.
The buyer in flowers or swimming is like the budget seat.
Another case, if the rubber is in the buyer with the original graph.
For example, from a computer game in a role fighter genre.
Her attention will be less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 is improved by the front and behind seats, which provides the optimal reserve of space and for wide bottles, and for long foot-feeds.
More long-terms are probably expected to be that the pressures in the front of the central tonnel are now mild and are not thrown in the pressures.
The most wide range of Mazda active security systems is exactly on CX-5.
To recognize the potential threat, there are radars, lasers and cameras.
There's an adaptive about this, and a warning of the dead area, and monitoring the dead zones, and safe disturbance.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best baggage in the class.
The seats are contained in proportions 4:2:4 and each section is acquired by a high-extraordinary cycle and increases the bathroom to 1560 l.
Costum of the multifilm hero in Japan calls "kigurums".
It looks specially swimming-pijama.
It's all possible!
Sure to sleep.
But it is still to distract young children.
Or just swallow this bird on the street...
Because it's so good when there's a choice -- a cool clothes, a way of behavior or a car.
Thank you for helping to prepare material Kawaicat.
Kiev destroyed the atomic unity.
Kiev officially refused Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the AES Hmelnic.
The main advice in the middle of the second trial, however, discussed the disruption of the agreement with Moscow.
Contracts on the delivery of the third and fourth block were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to access the project.
In the middle of the High Council, Ukraine adopted a law which distorted an agreement with the FP on the building of a third and fourth block on the AES Chamber in 2010-2012.
The draft legislation was made to the Government of the country only from the second vote, and it was first supported by 210 deputats at a minimum of 226 years, but then 234 members of the Parliament were submitted to the draft.
The SSR of the AEA for the original project had to calculate four energy blocks of 1 GHT with VHR reacters, but only two were able to build.
The negotiations with Moscow on the delivery led to the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Agreement to 2010, the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, the building of blocks was supposed to come to the credit of the Russian party, but the funds were not so.
After turning to Kiev to February 2014 and following this refrigeration in the two countries of Kiev began to be joined with Moscow to atomic growth by announcing the refusal to cooperate with the AEA and the Construction project in Ukraine.
The only area where they were maintained remained buying fuel in the RF for Ukrainian AEA (approximately half of your electricity in the country), since the Ucrainian NEC "Energy" replaced Russian supplys.
The AEA Supplement plans and other Ucraine subsequently have not been rejected: in 2014, the Czech Schoda JS negotiations were reported in Kiev in 2014.
United Nations against the use of military force in the resolving of the Syrian conflict.
The Secretary-General of the UN Pan Gi Mun reported during the press conference that the situation in Syria would be resolved by military means.
"The military decision is not," the AP addresses its response to the question of the military support of Syria from Russia.
Mr. Gi Mun also reported that he would take a meeting with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Constant Members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will take a meeting with the heads of IMEs of the United Nations permanent members later in this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Mr Henschab's head of Russian Russia Nicolai Bogdanovski reported that Hanschab does not exclude the possibility of creating in the future UK base in Syria.
No such plans.
"But everyone may be," said Mr. Goddanski.
"E" reported earlier that the United States did not trust the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who said that the military assistance to the official Damaskus was to combat the terrorists prohibited by the "Islam State" grouping.
More details about the United States doubts of Syria's Russian assistance, read the "Russian military presence in Syria fears Washington."
The OBSE reported the possible meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentaries.
The head of the Ukraine delegation in the Parliament Assembly (PA) OSCE Arthur Herasimov reported the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation on the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is planning a certain meeting this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian Parliamental Delegations," Mr. Gerasimov's words.
He also invited the Mine Agreements to be fulfilled and "return to the normal livelihood of our countries".
The question is whether the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the Parliamental level is currently " Normandian" or as a contact group on the PABCE area, Mr. Gerasimov, noted that the dialogue was conducted in Mine Agreements.
At the same time, the political statement supports any kind of dialogue in Kiev.
The former representative of Ukraine on negotiations, Leonid Cuchma's ex-president, stated that the Donekian and the Luganian Republic were in principle until they had changed their positions on three-side negotiations, but the tonality of the dialogue became more efficient.
Parties were distributed to the mandates.
The election committee of low Norwegian yesterday made the outcome of the elections in the city's municipal environment by distributing 12 deputate mandates played on partial wheels.
Traditionally a lot of complaints on elections were sent by the representatives of the CCPF, accused of the election in the "covery of falses".
The observations of the opposition were not accepted.
On one occasion, the Russian Communist party was rejected in the organization of a reference that was rejected for a multi-quarters house.
The City election officially made the results of the elections in the garden of low Norwegian on the municipal election area.

Two CCPs are distributed between Vladimir Bulan and the Deputate of Mr Alexander Tarnaj.
The three mandates of the Justice of Russia are obtained to Alexander Razumumski, Igoru Bogdan and Michail Shalugin.

Chairman of the Goliesbyrcom Alexander reported to the members of the Commission that it introduced a dejury for "the transfer of the Jirin's and other telegrams" to the derogation of the mandates.
In the implementation of the Protocol on the conclusions of the CCPF elections, the representatives claimed that they were distorted.
A member of the Horizbircom with the right of a consultative vote from the PRF Leonid Krasnokutski proposed not to recognize the outcome of the vote in the four areas of No 21-24, in order to conclude the entry from the administration, where four circle Commissions were available.
There were no deputates of Gos Woodma, no candidates, no observers, and the resonable scandal with the streaming door of the radioministerial was shown in the telephone.
At the meetings of the Environmental Commission, all observers and members of the committees with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
The Chapter stopped access only when the vote was completed and the Participant Commissions had not yet come to deliver their bulletins.
This was done to prevent different provokations.
"The Chapter was then adjusted, and at all meetings the interested parties could be presented," a couple of members of Natalia Andrew's mountains.
The Communists claimed that, in the locked opinion of the administration, the deputy of the Ludmile Aristow area was illegally holding the deputy for more than four hours, and that the following committee had the statement.
The opposition also insisted that a number of SIKs on the day of the elections began to print the hours at 6 to 7 hours tomorrow, making a bulletin for a periodic vote.
The members of the committees with the right of a meeting vote and observers have not been announced, so they have already come to the beginning of the elections on 8th morning.
The communists are convinced that on the morning before the opening of the elections in the hour, the bulletins could be cut off without control.
However, the mountains, which had already considered more than 124 complaints in different areas, did not find any injuries with the injuries of uncertain bulletins.
The members of the Commission and the proposal of their college from the " Justice of Russia" Mary Pope were not supported by the exhibition of the amendments to the regional legislation in order to clearly establish the conversion time with the bulletins of the prolonged vote, which then fall into the urna.
"In the right of your own initiative, turn to the CIC," advised Mrs. Pope Alexander's.
At the end of the meeting of the Chairman with sound accusations, a member of the CCPF Sergei Samochin, who claims that the election ignores tens of complaints and covers the false in elections.
"You're not here, you're not at the midnight, you'll say more!", the president of the election was disappointed.
It was almost uniform at the conclusion of the protocol.
On 27 September, the election should be approved by the general outcome of the elections, then the first subsequence of the Sixth Convocation of the city of the Neighbourhood will be appointed for three weeks.
In addition to the definition of the outcome of the elections of the city election committee from the political party of the Russian Communists in the register of the initiative group for the implementation of a referency.
In view of documents, the parties were going to discuss two issues of the undergrounds: whether they are with the fact that the collection of multi-quarters houses should be "rejected immediately" and the tariffs for the "community-community" service "forwarded up to 2020".
However, Irena Maslova’s lawyer explained that the "Russian Communists" treatment would be contrary to the law.
The FedEx exhibits a mixed character, reduction of the prognoses for 2016.
FedEx was reported on the necessary results of the last quarter, and the delivery service gigant reduced the annual advancement on the basis of the request for transport services and the increase in the loss in their land transport distribution.
The company also stated that it was planning to feed about 55,000 seasoners at the festival.
At the same time, FedEx reported that 50,000 temporary attendants would be held at the festivals.
Its actions shared approximately 2,5 percent of preliminary markets for 45 minutes until the opening of the boards in the middle.
FedEx Corp. stated that it planned to pay $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ends in May 20 cents less than in the previous project.
Analytics assumed $10.84 in the FactSet review.
The reduction of the prognoses is observed, despite the average amount of 4,9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the growth of collections for the land transport of heavy or gabary burdens beginning in November.
The company claimed that it continued to plan to increase the expenditure in comparison with the last year by reducing the costs, increased involving income and increasing online trade.
The Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company was "stablely with regard to those who were, compared to the prognoses, economic activities, especially in the production and world trade".
The plans for the slaves of force in the festival were announced on the day following the concurrent statement, UPS, that they were planning to determine additional 95.000 persons, approximately as much as they adopted in the last year.
For the quarter that ended 31 August, FedEx was $692 million for 6 per cent more than year ago.
Action income with $2,42, close to the average predict of $2,44 for the action carried out by Zacks Investment Research for 12 analyses.
Income increased by 5 %, to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analytics called Zacks were $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from the fall in the strict transport sector, which has resulted in the lack of the increase in the income in its exposure.
However, the purchasing pump on the Internet has rapidly improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the outcome of land transport has grown up to 29 %, however, operational incomes remained totally without amendments to the extent of great delivery and self-security.
A higher income from higher basic rates has been distributed in the transport sector, while the income has fallen in the burden sector because of increased labour costs.
At the preliminary markets about a hour to open the FedEx action in $3.85 or 2.5 per cent - up to $150,15.
They closed Thursday, falling on 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent from 11 June.
At the most expected meeting for several years, the Federal Reserve System will take two days in this week after 27 feet table from the Ghanduras Red Tree, decideing whether it is not necessary to raise the key rate for nearly ten years.
At one time, a richly ornamented committee for meetings at two stages will have a strong picture of the United States.
This card is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System of Jenet L. Yellen and its colleagues should place economic interests in the country above all other.
The Central Bank received a double assignment from the Congress: maximising the employment in the United States and maintaining the price rates here.
However, since the Great Reception, the Federal System's holders recognized that there was a third uninscripted order: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be a factor in the presumptuous decision, which will declare on Thursday, whether the United States economy is ready to deal with an unprecedented stimulation, which is guaranteed by a zealous short-term rate from the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data makes a safe growth of the economy, recent developments on the world financial markets can also maintain so careful the Federal System's additional volatility by putting up the basic rates on the federal funds - only for the fourth percentage point.
"Obviously, the work market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Pegza, the main economy of the Broker Company by Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I think that if they were looking for a reason not to take up the taxes increased in the world market's indefinition, it was enough to give them the right to wait further," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they will do in the Federal Reserve System, which is self-related for the financial market.
Approximately half of the economy, recently invited Bloomberg, predicted the growth of the percentage rates for this week.
Financial markets, however, expect that the Federal System will be maintained, while the key indicator only shows an approximately 30 percent probability of a quick sum.
This may lead to the fall of the market of action if the Federal System will raise a tax, when those who make decisions will not affect the promise that the increase will not be done.
On Monday, Dou-Jones index was raised to 228,89 points, or to 1,4%, to 16 599.85.
The injury was developed by the expectations of the establishment of the Federal System to leave a tax on this week, - stated John Lonski, the main economyist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research group.
"I would be a surprise if the Federal System would increase the rates at this time," he noted.
If the Government of the Federal Reserve System does so, "they will have to go far to their own ability to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they may not be panic."
Other experts claimed that increasing taxation could be satisfied with the financial markets, since it would have an indetermination of how the Federal System would be.
For a month ago, the Federal System was able to raise the rates of 0.25 per cent in this month, making the first small step in the long-term financial assets that could be confirmed that the renewal of the United States would be retained.
Yellen stated at the beginning of the year that it was expected to increase the tax in this year, despite the complaints from the Liberals of the great economic progress.
Although new slaves appeared in August, the growth of the labour market was stabil in this year.
Without prejudice to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest indicator of more than seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal System considers full employment.
The growth of the employment shows the signs of the employment.
And, although the inflation continues to be under the planned central bank of an annual indicator at 2 per cent, the Government of the Federal System stated that it was a key reason for the timely effect of the rare oil price falling.
"The economy can be taken with higher taxes, and it needs them, taking into account the reduction of the labour market," noted Ian Shefferdson, the main economyist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the worldwide financial markets have become low at the end of the last month, after China has been acquired of its currency.
The average index of Dou-Jones for industrial companies has fallen in a total of 16 per cent of high value in May, since investors were afraid that the disturbance of China's economy could reduce global growth.
The risk of partly restored its positions in this month, and the index of Dou-Jones is now about 10 per cent below the highest value of the Maastricht.
For the Government of the Federal Reserve System, the market inflammation is further complicated by the immediate estimates of the increase in percentage.
"If there is no information about what happened in the financial markets and the news of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would be able to breath the gates at this meeting," said Steven D. Olinner, the higher investigations of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and the former Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to his predicts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is a great indetermination in the impacts of the American economy and they have almost no valid data after the last events in China," said Olinner.
Awake World Economy does not include the main burdens of the Federal System, and technically it should not be taken into account when taking these decisions.
However, the Federal Reserve System has become a global financial authority.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years was great.
Only one claim from the President Ben S. Bernance in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could "decrease" its daily expansion, called on the markets throughout the world.
In the world where markets and economic systems are growing up with each other, it could be expected that the Federal Reserve System's members will not only follow the development of the events overall but also consult the representatives of other Central Banks and experts to understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "better experience than science," noted Zacari Carabell, the Envestnet Inc, a company who is undertaken by global status management.
Jeffry Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there were excessive reactions on the movement of the financial market, which seem to be unfair to economic principles."
Laker, a member of the vote of the Effect Federal Committee on the Open Market, which was set up to increase the rates as an example of decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia led to the reduction of its basic rates by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, "with regard to the identified consequences for growth in the United States," Laker said.
A year later, the Federal System's members canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should be placed at the first place for stability only during the time of great crisis such as the market-up in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, an ex-committee for the establishment of a percentage rates in the Bank of England.
After the panic and nearly approached this level, he said.
"You would, of course, not want to be in the situation when you are afraid of growing tax because the markets are concerned about the employment," Pozen, President of the World Economy Institute, said.
The Law on the Federal Reserve System has still a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should take account of the events.

According to the Interfax, he expressed the journalists in Ulan Bator during the eighth session of the OBSE Parliamentary Assembly.

In commenting on the constant statements of the Western that Asad himself should go out, he noted that the President comes to the authorities by the agreement of the people through elections, and if it goes to the question of the people, not by the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference, or the Geneva Communist.
"If the people want him to stay - the President remains, and in the contrary, he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Asad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and said that they were working with them.

What the rest of the States is, we are open to cooperate with any of them in the presence of a serious desire to cope with terrorism.

He stated that at the phone interview of the "Lenty.ru" Correspondent.

Borodai stressed that he was not, why the American edition Correspondent decided to write that the Arrows were exported to the Russian Territory of "founded".
I'm surprising that it's a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, it's incrediblely misunderstood words, because I underlined that the Arrows were gone alone," said Borody.
"It's a bullet on me, and on the Arrows," he concluded.
The Washington Post pages earlier appeared an article in which the words of Borodya were reported about the fact that he carried the Arrows out to Russia's territory in a strong order.
According to that issue, Borodai noted that he had to connect his companion.

Thus, he said in the straight of the Moscow Radio Station, commenting on the fact that the Swefed Valen's shop supported the idea of the prohibition of sale of alcohol to citizens of 21 years.
The man's growing inequality.

It will begin to read with what it wasn't done before.
The Brazilian Union of Riu-Grandy’s pediaters promotes healthy food for food breasts
Brazilian pediatric SPRS has developed a scandal method that will help women to ensure the need for full-valued food during breast-feeding: the method underlines the demonstration of children's images of breast-feeding.
The breast milk includes different whites, jewelry, vitamins, and waters from which children receive all foods of arts needed to form a strong immune system.
As regards high energy needs for female and female women, it is recommended to increase the daily calories standard of approximately 500 calories in the summer.
However, recent investigations have been observed that one increasing calorie is not the only amendment of the diet that mother should do.
In a recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor of the Medical College of Baylor in Texas, the healthy food of women has actually been affected by genetic expressions in children and prevents the development of poultry.
Unfortunately, a negative impact on the child ' s immune system was detected.
Under Hamburg's train, the school bus was protagonized.
Near Hamburg was the train in the school bus, which was able to stick to the railway.
A 23-year-old leader, who realized that he could not be moved from the railways, had 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And in a minute after that, they had an eye on their faces.
He's got one of the schoolers on the video.
Because of a disaster among the disciples, a panic occurred.
Children started to cry and flee to the river.

Doctors call to prohibit box.
The Ru of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called to prohibit boxes in the country after the dead sportsman David Brown's youngest.
On Monday, the 28-year-old Brown ended from the trauma received in a single with the Philippine Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles on the version of the International Boxer Federation (IBF) in a weight category of up to 57.15 kg, which passed on Friday, ended the winning of Magalie in the 12th round.
Brown's gone into a hospital with a heavy-heavy traumatism.
It was estimated as a crite, and he was connected to the life-insurance equipment.
At the professional market, Brown had 22 wins, he had only two wounds and one battle ended.
He had two kids left.
This is the second case of aeronautical outcome among the Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, the 23-year-old student Braydon Smith ended the traumatism on the market.
Now AMA recommends not to act in such a manner, but better, from its view, to prohibit it.
I understand that this happens inconsistently, said the Vice-President of the organization of Steven Pernis.
But in the way there is a box, there will always occur when the sportsman gets blood-exilation or brain trauma that leads to death, or to serious damage.
For this reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure for medical doctors and medical students.
Sergei Nariskin invited the OBSE to cancel sanctions on the RF parliamentary.
Speakers of the RF Sergei Nariskin called an invalid introduction of sanctions against parliamentaries.
He stated that it had been on the OPCE session in Ulan Bator.
We appreciate this as an inappropriate action as a valuation of a parliamentary diploma.
"And this should not be repeated because this is a manifestation of political insult and ignorance of the principles of the open international dialogue," said the policy.
In addition, Nariskin invited the OBSE participants to restore Russia and the EU's partnership.
Let's return moral to politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to the international community.
Let's return humanitarian ideals to the Democratic peace order.
"The two never ended anything good," he said.
By speaking from the Court of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Russian House's officer invited the parliamentaries to establish a interparlamental contact group for Ukraine.
I invite the members of the Assembly to conclude with specific tasks to ensure security.

He also noted that the OSCE should be granted.
"This is almost the only general area where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," stressed the policy.
At the meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly, the meeting was opened on Friday, 15 September, in Ulan Bator, and was extended until 18 September.
I enjoyed a couple of days.
Peace Champion on a easy athletic Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphate for a 24-year-old easier atlet from Barnaul Sergei ShuBENKOVA.
He has succeeded at his coronary distance to win 110 meters with bariers at the command of Prime Ministers, to establish a number of records, and to become a world champion, and first in the history of a fatherly barberal spire.
Moreover, the sportsman has recently wined the final stage of the Brilliant Liga, taking the third place in general.
"New New News" asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the outcome season.
Sergei, isn't the season done for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to speak on World War Games that will go in October in Korea, and then I'll think about relaxation.
True, I'm going to be ready now, in Barnaul, and to be home, it's still different.
It's more than every week to be moving in the world.
You said the egg is a favorite time for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a time.
The suffering after the main start of the season has been cut off, and the responsibility is no longer given.
Perhaps it is a pleasure, a pleasure.
Plus you know that the department is quickly...
Is there a worm?
Even so, the season's, the mass of local emotions...
The ability to the end of the season is always appealing.
And it's not important that he did more -- he wined or lost.
Each exercise is stress.
Permanent overflows, transition is not all this for the body unfortunately.
You're up physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course.
I'm just happy!
At the moment when finishers are at peace campions in Pekina, are they often returning?
There's.
Yes, you, journalists, don't let me forget that.
But I think that the bad sportsman who lives by old wins is going to swallow his successful runs again and again.
I enjoyed a couple of days, and we need to move further.
Did preparing for this wonderful season be very different from the normal?
I can't say there was something special.
We started to be ready in December, but I missed the winter with the employment season.
Tren's sleeping at home in Barnaul, then at the assemblies, then again home.
It's as usual.
But with the trainer, they were assigned to try to get out to the new level I had not yet been.
Almost all winter times have been able to put a base.
They fled the cross, made the work of the social office preparation that included the weight, and the presence, and we broke up the bridge.
Then they were adopted for barber preparation, and many worked with technology.
How did the companions follow?
I'm always trying to do that, well in the Internet's time, there's no problem with it.
He looked at the winter championate, and there, in the barry press, the whole piedest was taken by the French!
He's still thinking, you have to do something to distribute this company.
With each start in this season, you added and added results.
Did that add confidence?
I have all the last seasons on the same scheme.
There's no way I'm going to sleep 13,20, and then 13,50.
I'm always making my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do is getting out of 13 seconds.
All the work was first addressed to this result.
But the paradox is that you feel that it's ready for the trains, and that it's not always possible to show their preparation.
How was that, for example, at Olympide in London?
I, if honestly, was that half-final run (Shubenkov wasn't able to go to the final.
It was quite good, he could actually escape from 13 seconds.
Yes, even if I had repeated his best result at that moment, it would have been a bronze player.
But it's not lucky.
Remember your first world championate?
What about it?
It was in Tega.
I really wanted to go to the final, it was a program-ma.
And he went away from the morning, in the preliminary running.
Then he realized that he was driving and wearing the crap, means he wouldn't come to anywhere.
Two years in Moscow's world campaign has already been finalized with the best time.
I remember my feelings in front of those who decide: I wanted to win the gold!
How can it not be able to disconnect by developing a particular speed and not to lose any more?
And that's the most complicated thing.
We need to be very accurate, focused on the technology so that we don't wipe bariers.
He noted that when you're looking for no result, but for the process, it's so much more.
And the coffee, when you're feeling that you're running, and it's like it's getting yourself!
Honest word, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depth after the first serious success are trying to move closer to the capital.
Has there never been such thoughts?
Home's still better.
I don't imagine where I am without my trainer, who I need?
Maybe it's good to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be satisfied with what I have.
C keys you've been together for a long time?
From 12 years of age, from the pounds that came to the Atlantic.
More precisely, I dreamed with his wife who worked with the children, and then she delivered me.
I started with the spinner, and then I've been in the length of the three.
Children's multilinguality, it's when they're cutting the bottle, getting out of the place...
At 14th I tried to run with barbers, and I liked it.
From the first time, the second adult class was able to comply with the rules.
That's what I've left.
Has there never been fear of the bars?
Sometimes there's been an agreement with them.
But the technology always had to work very much.
It's over one of them how painful it was!
But there's nowhere from this rutine.
The technician has to be able to get awake at night, I'd get up and run through the bariers.
Everyone who has seen your run in Pekina says that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked myself.
I usually don't review my runs, but I couldn't stay here.
But the efficiency needs to continue to work - there are no definitions of compatibility.
Do you not be afraid that victory for a year before the Olympian games is located on a heavy rate?
As they say in such cases, I'm trying to justify the expectations.
Once you chose this way, you're supposed to go to the end.
My trainer likes to repeat, "If you're not a person, you don't have to feel any additional burden.
And I'm absolutely here with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive to bring me to a surprise of an interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are worried, I understand, they don't eat with their bread-- give them, breathe.
And even though I didn't miss the flag, and the same thing, a million times, I talked here, and I didn't call anybody, I've been able to do another thing.
All my pseudonyms were able to get out of here for a second.
The pressure I'm looking for is so → that even I'm looking like a boy, I think the people were white.
It's like he's gone, and the multitude's attacked you, and it's just mutualizing the pockets.
But you need to know me, I'm not a comat orle, I'm a cow, I'm out of the cowboy, old I, guys, fearing.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have such an illusion, and now...
The best in me was always self-sufficiency, so you're trying.
And giving passports to people like Fred Derst or Monson, they can only be stuck.
It's better for me, the best journalist, to be stupid.
A week ago, Kiev Otar Kushanashvili has warranted the crime events:
What they've done with the Crimish half is a crime.
That's exactly what they're calling for.
I guess it's like that the Cruzzle has tried to sign something, and it's not in any case in the general image of the community.
It's like to come to the neighbor and take his livestock...
The war from Cremla went, and it's just over there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, as in 2008, she started with a call from a crowd of Creml.
I'm supposed to be who this could be...
Cobson's not so much to live.
I don't understand he's the biggest artist, why he needs to put his hands in Pu's hands.
He's gonna lose the apartment?
Well, you brought him a memory.
Of course, the people have seen him as aware of their small family.
And now the reconciliation only depends on Vladimir Vladimirovič.
Sunrise the Seventh leads in the review despite the Nineth's trial to highlight the loss of leaders in Today Show
The outcome of Carla Steeovicz and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra for the consequences of the Liberal Party on the freedom of the leader's place, has not been able to raise the review of Today.
The morning show of the Nineth Transl was from the capital of the State after Malcolm Ternbulle Tony Abbot was deceived.
Concurrent Sunrise, with the leader David Koch and Samantha Armitage, was held in London within a weekly series of international meetings, including Dubai, New York, Nigara-Folz and Cancun.
This torture of race seems to have no significance for Australian telasers, while Sunrise's auditorium counted 397 000 lookers in the five largest cities compared to today's auditorium in 339 000.
Today has reached a little more compared to its review on Monday (317,000) and last Thursday (283,000), but its number was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced Sunrise breakdown in the last months.
In August, Today had 318 000 compared to 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the breaking was between 40.000 and 50.000.
Until September Sunrise has 349 000 lookers against 314 000 in Today.
It's the most interesting thing that happened all the morning.
The wind changes affect more than the Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are all right, thank you for exactly!
TODAY was held on Monday, 14 September 2015.
A significant news for the Seventh was a 800-Words-depth with the former star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
The new drama of the recent widow father of the family, which decides to move to New Zealand to live with his two children, collected an impressive audience in 1,219 million lookers.
The critics considered whether Tomson could handle a popular show on the same side, without the Rafters stars of Rebecca Gibni.
The result of yesterday evening is a sound answer "yes".
The X Seventh Factor remained in strong positions with an auditorium of 1,136 million lookers, easily running The Block (838.000) and TBL familys (726.000).
For the Seventh, happiness and failure were mixed in the second evening of Chase.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television, which Andrew O'Kiphy led, has gathered 446 000 lookers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the number of supports was up to 623 000 lookers - enough for a small winning over Hot Seat Eddie-Gwair (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase’a was assembled 520 000 stars, and the second half-hour was 720.
Hot Seat collected 620 000.
The fall of Chase's ratings on the second evening will make the Nineth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still be dominated at 5.30.
Chase日a is a replacement of Million ́ Minute, which couldn't play a show-Guirra.

The secret is discovered?
Lana Javons Fellows, Sarah'a and Snow Markoski may have made a chance to understand who of them wins in "Holostjake".
The woman with which, finally, remains with the Wood in the " Holostajake" is surrounded by the secret weight.
And three of those coming to the end of the end, it is likely to keep silence on who of them has received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah, the Snow Markoski and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the day when two of the three girls are to stay, they may be unfortunately suggested about the winner.

However, their answers to the question, "If you are not, who should be found after the widow rose?" They could not be able to subscribe who of them actually had the heart of "Holosaka".
Jevons Fellows and Markoski, without doubt, called a perfect couple for Wood.
A good course has been established between Sarai and S.C. since the first day.
"From the time I entered the number of participants, I felt energy (Saria) and Sam energy and I realized that they were very close to each other, and that throughout all the show, I had no doubt about it," said Jevons Fellowus.
"Sara is very open, easy and funny with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, there's really an attraction between them.
They feel comfortable and comfortable.
Sarah's thinking that Sam Wood will get a different couple of it.
Sama'cay said that thanks to the home meetings last week, she realized that Wood might be the most human.
"When I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it wasn't just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she says.
The question who should choose Wood, if it is not her, replied mysteryly.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both of them equally, and Snow and Lana are worth it equally.
Shaw The Bachelor is in the middle of 19.30 on the Ten channel.
Initially described as "Sara is the best choice of Sam Wood?"
Jerryd Hayne had a few options for the start of the carrier in NFL.
Detroit and Siattle were very interested in them after his transfer to the United States, as well as other clubs who sent requests after the printing open training day at the end of the last year.
But Hein chose San Francisco 49ers and Dr. Jim Tomsula, and it seems to be a wise decision.
The trainers would have left Heaven on the stone of the rest of the game for the loss of the sword, which the ex-Australian Regby player allowed on the first return of the Pant in the Minnesota winner game with 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and Hane another opportunity to return the Pant, and also enabled him to play after Reggie Bush's traumatism.
Thomas showed himself from the good side and after the game, in the divorce.
Instead of building the difference between the newspapers in the presence of the team, he encountered them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Heaven at the press-conference after the torture.
Inman reported that Hein was also supported by the coordinator of the Tomas's special teams, which advised him to forget the lost meat and to think about the game.

Diabetics with small heat can help chemical surgery
A pleasant effect after the chirurgical surgery in people with a small heat of type 2 diabetes may be at least five years, a new study.
However, it is still early to say that the diabetes with small heat will be longer after the chirurgical surgery than those receiving non-chirurgic treatment.
"The Statistics of the Property are unconflicted," said Dr. Robin Blaxstone, an expert on the chirurgical surgery, who wrote about the new investigation in the JAMA Surgery editor.
The chirurgical surgery, or bariatric chirurgical, uses various methods to reduce the size of the ice.
They decrease the feeling of the famine and make people ability to cover food.
In a few years, bariary chirurgy has been performed until its efficiency for treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the basic studies were conducted among people with more than 35 or more inhibitors of the body mass.
IML, a measure of weight increasing, is considered normal in the meaning of 18,5 to 24,9.
IMT 25 or above tells us that human weight has an emergency weight, and people with ICT over 30 are considered to be hungry.
You can calculate your MIT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new investigation of researchers from the Taywan hospital Min-Sheng General ispoDescription of the data collected from 2007, for comparison of two types of chirurgical barriers - the shunging of iron and hand-gastrectoma, with the medical treatment of type 2 of diabetes with small heat.
The average importance of the ICT has fallen from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year of the investigation.
At the same time, the ICT has those who have received non-chirurgic treatment from the diabetes remains approximately 29.
A total treatment of 36 per cent of the oper was made, and partly 28 per cent is 28 per cent of the diabetes.
In the group receiving medical treatment for comparison, full treatment from diabetes was observed only at 1%, and partial is only about 2%.
Moreover, blood pressure indicators, triglycerides and "what" LPNC cholesterine " were in general better in the chirurgical group," said the authors.
Researchers also control the level of hemoglobin A1s in blood, reflecting blood sugar levels in dinamic.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to maintain below 7%, - researchers write.
The average level of hemoglobin A1c was decreased from about 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the therapeutic group, it remained stabil, approximately 8 per cent.
However, the best control indicators reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c did not decrease the level of the level of kvalitet within five years, according to the investigator of Dr. Chi-Chung Su and colleague.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to a group with a handheld gastrointestinal group, the sanitation group lost more weight (18.7 kg/14.2 kg), increased IMM reduction (7.4 against 5.1) and A1s (3.1% against 2.5.1%) and was closer to the full diabetes remission (46.9% against 16.7%).
Although a new study does not demonstrate the advantages of the method of surgery in part of life after five years, it is subject to the results of the investigation of people with a major mass of body in Sweden that the treatment is actually leading to an increase in life, as Blackstone from College of the Medical Health reported in Mr. Finix, the Arizona University.
According to the Swedish investigation for people with anger, he chose the barrier to be involved, the probability of death for 15 years was about 29 per cent below compared to the group in which more traditional methods were applied.
Although the new investigation had not shown an increase in life, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with IMEs under 35 interested in such a procedure.
"The report is very important here, since it claims that such a chirurgical involvement will be safe in a group with low MT, where there is no increased risk of the risk of the risk of the risk of the Property or the expensive diseases," she stated.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start seriously as the patient's IMI falls in the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to make people feel serious about this," she said.
I feel that as soon as they bury genetic changes in their bodies, it is very difficult to turn it back in their body.
In Vitistach, the buritors were brought out of the house of shoes and nine million rubbles.
In Vitistach, the inhabitants of the underground house stole nine million rubbles and three female shoes.
It reports the Interfax with the MVD RF press service.
The incident occurred on Thursday morning.
Two non-introduced doors entered in the house located on the mountain street, joined the 20-year-old son of the household, and threatened by both knifes, struck nine million rubbers and three shops.
According to the preliminary data, the amount of damage was 9 million 265 thousand rubles, excitated by the Court of Auditors.
Fanates from Property are risked to become homeless.
Only 23 Peterburg hotels have the right to place tourists who will come to see the world campaigns in 2018.
The rest of the guests will have the corresponding authorisation.
According to experts, it's a very anxious sign.
At the front of the world priority, the authorities will have to consider how to displace all the villages of the city.
The Rosbalt meetings believe that the valuation of the rental of the seed apartment is 10-30 per cent because of the tournament, and after the campaign for the summer, it is necessary to be paid.
Peace Championates for the authorities to take attention to the Russian guests.
In accordance with the law, specially written under the first, each of the towns of Petersburg should proceed and prove that it corresponds to the number of stars and the level of service.
It is now understanding that it will not be possible for all: the officers are so scared of checks that they are not even sending documents on the requests of the Federal Anticopolary Service for Petersburg.
As the UFAS Chapter Vadim Vladimirov said, the statement studied 138 hosts and now planned 34 cases about guests, many of which simply did not respond to the antimopolis.
There are signs that the leading of three decades of companys was lying, locating that or another number of stars in the reklame, Wladimirov noted.
The problem is that now, literally, each number, no one will lose before 2018.
Factors understood that during the football champion, the hospitals will take all Petterburg hotels.
Tourists can now be calculated by 30.5 thousand numbers.
According to Smolano, 17 five stars, 51 four star hotels, 100 - two stars, 550 stars.
According to the first Representative of the Tourism Committee of Nana Guitia, only 23 guests at this time passed by the class - so many checks were performed in Petterburg.
And this is whether any party has ordered a similar procedure in regional enterprises, the Remember on a surprising level of circumstances is not.
I mean, the past class may be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last half-years of the hotel have not been very efforted to pass the class," admitted North-West Russian tourist Union Ekaterin Shadski.
This is explained by a high season, during which officials are acquiring more money and do not want to work in other cases.
Another reason is that the budgets which have not been charged for checking, the procedure may take place a hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubbers and more.
However, recently, the guests have been active and started to give applications to the class, confirmed Shadski.
The hotels have to succeed until 1 July 2016, Otherwise they will not only pay a lot, but they will not have the right to work on the world campaigns.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed payment for the hotel number will be multiplied in the time of tourning.
Forms for which the value will be calculated shall be discovered in the year.
This is made to not allow 200-300 per cent prices, for example during the economic forum of Peterburg.
We need to have conscience and not allow to increase two-three times, but also the hotels have to be acquired.
"I think it's going to grow up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Guest Association of Gennadi Lamshin.
In its range, Vadim Vladimirov is uncertain that price fixation corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this is involved in economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"This is a better deterioration," he said.
It's not clear that it's going to be with the population of rainhouse hosts.
The Deputates of the House introduced a legislative project for which hosts should be prohibited in resident homes.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or not be cast into Peterburg.
"We will leave the point of view that the hosts should be kept," Nana Guacia believes.
However, in any case, it states that the mining owners should be prepared for the extent of the Life Code.
If the Lord still approves the legislative project, there will be approximately 80 per cent of hosts in Petterburg, and at this time 1,5 thousand numbers are counted.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and of North-West Leonid Harbar, there are two and three stars in Petterburg, which are increased by football diseases, so there is a cross on the side of the guests with four and five stars.
Such a situation is similar to the situation when "a 80-month stadium is 75,000 votes".
This can be adjusted once in the account of the mines.
The expert's prohibition is "Idiotism": "I am strange that some people can live in apartments, and this is why they can't come."
If the host is used as a society, I'm sorry that it's wrong.
But if as a guest in which the guests come for a short time, why not?
Mineral guests are risked to lose the world's championates by football and because of their increasingness.
Hundreds of small villages are simply not able to pass the class and do itself.
By 2016, all town hotels will be assigned to work.
"Firms who can do this procedure not so much, so they will reject less paid orders from mines and will choose those who are," observed Gennadi Lamshin, adding that in several cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the current checks are significantly higher than the Petterburg.
The cause of Petterburg ' s delay, including continuous interruptions in the Government ' s tourist block, which does not contribute to the compatibility.
Experts consider that if the Petterburg Islands are not enough, it is most important to take attention to the areas of hotels and houses of relaxation.
For example, the 300-year festival of Petterburg in the town can make a float, so the tournament guests can live in cavets.
Moreover, many sick ones will be prepared to come on the furgones in which they will be able to nightmare.
"The main is not setting so many guests that they will be empty," is the sure Gennadi Lamshin.
Moreover, the major population in the time of the football primary is going to be able to be able to be able to stumble.
The most probably in the town will create the reservation of seed apartments.
The rates will grow up by 10 to 30%.
"It is evident that the first while is near the stage," noted the specialist on the Agency's Agency's Arrangement and investigated in Laris Bragin's inevitability.
Instead, the price of the arending may not return to the previous level after the campion, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will also contribute to the building of new transport connections in the areas of the city, and it stressed it.
You should not forget the qualitys of the world.
For example, Leonid Harbar is sure that Peterburg was always a guesty city in which people are not just awaiting the road, but can even perform a min-excursion.
It's also difficulty.
My dad in 1970 in the court met a family from Murmanska, a father, a mother, and two children.
They were somewhere at night: there was hard to sleep with the guests, and they were hard to sleep at the box.
"And the dad brought them into a communal apartment to sleep," recalled the council.
True, he added that this is not the case in the city's residents -- calling home with the consequences and consequences.
But may it be necessary to remember that in 2018 after a failure decision of the House, the mistakes of the members and Governments should be remembered?
Zirin' Slil's Amur's area.
He looked at the Cloud Girinov in Gosdom today.
He did things when our generation was still learned to trade newspapers, and it has been in the form of this.
The theme of the statement would like be "the protest of the LDR against the results of the elections in the Amur area".
No protocols - because nothing; other protocols, other than the elections signed, have not been judged by the LDR.
He raised the second place of Ivan Abram and cried out something like, "This is the winner of the elections."
And there's nothing to do with Rodney, and then, after you've been thrown with the president, it's putting a fraction from the meeting room, and it's literally "You're all with your fronts of your yellows and bottles."
The press, naturally, gives not the accent to Abramov, but to scandal and demarsh fractions as a result of this scandal and of burning.
Really, Volfovich was nice and elegantly swimming the area of Amur together with Abram.
For the whole country, this is the exceptional outcome of Zirinovska in the style " Pondoki" and is not the protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the fraction has formally scanned, and the choices, if you believe the party site and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the subject is obviously deceived.
It provides the dead in Amure to keep their dead, and it is the good news against the "Single Russia" at all and in nothing of the family.
Excellent decision to not lose the face, and to the actual, and not to the proof scandal.
Another matter that Abraham himself is now in a strange situation.
Furthermore, he did not expect anything from the beginning, there were no alternative protocols on the hands.
He is not focused on public attention, on the one hand, but on the other hand, it is the right course of the chairman and of the relevant campaign, and, in addition, the Hamish accidents to the ER and UNF.
And here, of course, he must think very seriously what to do.
Because from the main election beneficiary, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 to the only one-mandated area, it can be converted into a money that has been successfully made by its own partial guide and super-substrate for the same UNF and the partial guide of the strange.
That's exactly that there would be no Jericho, he should be thinking and watching exactly.
The trumpet grows and grows up before him.
The news was that the LDR would return to the salon during the same pleasure.
That's what the bathroom falls from nothing.
Only Abram's theme is buried under himself.
It's really beautiful.

We must weak the use of strength.
The application of strength has never solved these problems," he added.
In terms of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's action after terrorism Acts 9/11, stated that the U.S. heavy reaction had launched an emergency of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my diseases in writing to President Bush and told him that the solution of this problem might be caused by unfairness.
I know that his works were good, but he applied the power, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.

"The children are more contacted with these things, and, desirablely, some percent of them are sent to rapid assistance," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink a specially deficiency, and some do so to impress their friends, or to face the networks.
On Youtube videos, adults see how they drink as a rain drink.
As reported, adults mixed the decifissive heat with spirit content for the mouth to get a stronger drink.
Children of the younger age can bring pleasant deficiencies of disinfect.
"The baby doesn't think that it could be to him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (dezinfictions for hands) are those who are arrogant.
There are desinfectational disorders for the hands of the rubbers, the wine, the applesin, which are very attractive for children.
The determining heat for hands contains somewhere from 45 to 95 per cent of spire.
Small children, especially, can cause only a few disorders to be alcoholic.
"This is a high-concentration speed," said Fox 4 in Cansas-City, Dr. Steven Tornton, the main doctor of the body of the centre at the Cansa University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a whisper so much, but people have a view of these disabilities for hands, and if children come to them, it's a quick way to use a large quantity of alcohol.
Naigia Russell, a six-year girl who recently had developed a dezinfiction instrument for the hands of a club aroma in approximately four disorders, was sent to treatment in rapid assistance.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice more than the adult, which is considered in the status of alcohol in the law, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, a rapid assistance doctor who treated her in the Medical Centre of Gwinnett near Atlantic.
The Naipha was broken and couldn't walk when it was delivered to a quick help.
The doctors watched her all night in the clinic to not lose any signs of brain traumatism, since the girl was fallen and hit by alcohol, Ritchie told.
"This was very strict," the CNN Ortorium Scott, the mother of Naidzi.
It could be fully able to be able to be my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use unexpected arts or disabilities, other than to remove the dezinfictions for the hands of children's advantage.
In addition to alcoholic disorder, some disdefiniting disorders are related to Âs.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the dezinfectation of the toxic index contained.
The health factors understood that the product contained metabolism is a mortal agent, not the ethnic spirit, which was indicated as an artificial art.
In January, three four students in the north of New York agreed to submit their "opposition" teacher through the "proliferation of antibacteriaal arts in the class", the police report.
The teacher has a powerful allergies on the designer for hands, and she prohibited to keep them in her class.
The police believes that the unexpected plan was " empty" and addresses the issues of the discipline of the school area.
As the oldest library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the stairs at the entrance in their border library, N.K. the Crop-Gruppe's throat.
Children who follow the books are trying to feed her confessions.
A number of generations have already gone into this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the twenty years of the past centuries were drawn up a sound book here, placed the Akaklis in the verses of Michael, conducted literature victoria and rescribed with the wife of Lenin.
The transscription continued four years, and, as the newspaper The Young Stainer wrote in 1939, "a friendship between the Hope of the Constantin Group and friends of the City Library of Barnaul" has become stronger every day.
The Constantino ' s hope has even sent to a remote Barnaulian friendship.
And when the barnaules asked, doesn't hope that the Constantinian hopes for the library to give her name, he wrote that he doesn't.
The letters have been split in the museum, and the first readers and the rights have to explain whose severe profile has improved the barleef on the library.
In the years of rebuilding, different people were often called: Why is the library not renamed?
Let's be a library of the name of any good writer, without a political scroll!
Library partners thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Kropski" is, please, the most favorite and library in Barnaul, like a "lenin" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library news bullet is a trace from the yellow kitchen.
The "The Head of the Extorsion City" is the favorite theme of Oli Moskovki's artist.
Earlier, Ola was a manager in the court of the company, coming to the eighth, walking to five, and all other managers were different from the love for drawing.
And then there was a statement on the Internet: "There's needed an illustration for the book."
The book was written by a small American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" -- "My mom has cancer."
Oil made illustrations, and I thought life could end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them alone.
Now she works in the library, illustrates the books of the writers of all the world and makes stories.
Traditionally, the children have lost interest in the book that they will be more in some virtual space...
But we are going to reading children, and their parents understand the importance of reading -- tells the Russian Planet, director of Tatian Kushvid's library.
In the past years, we have even arrived in such a time of confidence that the library needs, and it's going to live -- the kids are coming here!
I know, the interest of reading returns.
In the library’s newspaper, there will be a large exhibition expenditure with the updated exhibition.
Once in the apartment, new graphs of readers are held in the whole family library: Mother, Dad and Children.
The library rejoices that the fathers and the children have become increasingly coming.
If a child reads all Chukovski in two years, he needs more complex books in age.
But now it is law that prohibits the eighth-year-old uncertainty of books in category 12+.
To get such a book, the children must bring their parents with themselves - they come, then return again, and gradually "Cropski" becomes something like a family club for them.
The library contains stocks - the revolutionary collector wasn with cattle and ears, leading Coronelko in the Annex to the newspaper "Nive", the "Murzelle" extension for 1936.
Because we are not only the conceptual space of the book, we are now open for motion, we are trying to become a place of a place: not a house, not a school, explains Tatian Kushvid.
We can come to read all together, play, draw.
We made a game zone for the kid -- the kid's just comes to play, and a hand is still going to the book!
Some of our readers have a parent, and they are stuck with their legs, and they don't want to leave.
Moms are often coming and we are glad that they put the library on the first place among all the other places where you have to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says, modern children like we ever love classic literature:
"Iz's case is now developed, and a lot of attention is given to the authors I'm being able to join between generations."
And if they talk about small rubbers, they're important to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to divorce their heroes.
It continues to release the booklets for parents, in which it says what happens in the modern literature, on which books should be taken attention and why.
The booklets have so much intrigued and intrigued that adults are interested, but this library is not yet for them.
It is prohibited to carry out books for a number of reading rooms to adults.
It's only a big privilege for children.
...In the next library, there's a square bullet with an ancient wooden wooden woods in the pod, in the book store.
The stones will hide under your steps, it's a very old time machine.
You're in the book of your Property, like the old friend: Hello, well that we're not changing with you.
Ellie's still so enjoyingly walking on the road with a yellow yellow kirpich, the Tola Ridjikov hangs out the rocks, and the little Kibalchis doesn't say to the cursed war secrets, that's a firm word.
These books are such as passwords, in any way you can know their own.
There are in the storage and actual book of frequency - for example, a revolutionary assembly with acets and heras.
Or conduct the Queenco in an appendix to the newspaper.
Or the "Murzells" puzzle for 1936.
The time of the old pages was cut into the tea color.
These publications are no longer issued to the readers.
It's our future collection, I'm thinking, I'm going to get out of the pension and take care of the rare books.
But the kids will say that they're not going to do, and the boxes in old books are not very light, and the subjects... you're opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the Common.
Now: Why did we all write this "Pioner Truth"?
But it was still interesting -- says the Russian Planet, Gallina Ilasov, which leads to book protection.
The Mourzels pages have been dark from time to time.
Gallina Va'evna leads to a bookservice all his life.
She knows the color of the rocks in Buratino, in the training year of Harry Potter, the Captain of Gryffindor's team on the campaign on which Carlson uses the mouse for a motorist, and who works the father of Alice Selce.
The library will be a little, and everyone who can live without these book lines finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convicted are: lighters, pedagogues, officers of the book.
They can also be learned as a smile - it is a professional chart of the library.
If he smiled you in the first minute, he's a professional.
I like the books: how a library I like them to stand on the fields, and I like to read them, says Gallina Va'even.
I read everything: military, historical behavior, stories, statistics.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I've got everything else in my ability.
The books were the most interesting and captive of everything that happened to me.
And because I loved them stupidly, I thought the library was a big place.
And I wanted to work where everyone's sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the rider.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children, and that's the little ones...
List of hearings: "Seltic" does not have distinctions
Gryphites had the differences in the "Seltics" after the recognition of Daily that "Hops" was in a bad situation, but he would correct it.
Harts will protest against the claim of the Scotland Football Association to Neilson, and Warberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that can violate the unity of the team
Dons increased the advantage before "Seltic" to five points
Adam Runey's penalty in the first story gave Aberdin a small benefit from "Gamilton" in Pi'odory, which allowed Dons to be removed from "Seltic" to five points.
Griffits has committed divergence
This led to hearing about the differences in the Seltics, which were interrupted by Griffits, saying that he and his team companions were not suffering from any increased criticism, preparing for meeting with the leaders of the Netherlands Library.
I don't think we feel pressure, I think the players are trying to do it.
The Netherlands are sorrowful because Scotlanders are not in fight against the title - de Bur
An ex-Rangers and the former member of the Netherlands Collection Ronald de Bur said that the Netherlands footballs have lost interest in the Seltic because it is not a title with Rangers.
De Bur, currently the representative of Ajaxus, said, "In Netherlands, the most of the games of Saltics are not attached, and why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interesting.
A lot of pressures in the "And firm" games, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change all," said Dale
Ronnie Dale admitted that "Seltic" was in trouble, but the Norwegian trainer had promised to change everything.
Following Malmoa and the outcome of the Champion League followed the loss of 10 footballists Aberdin, which now takes a loop of the table, with five points.
However, Dale said, "The "Selletta" had bad periods and before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand that it's very painful, and there's no people very, very bad or confused with what's happening.
We're too, but we need to continue.
And we really need the "Seltic" support, because the player becomes very better than this.
Stay together so important now.
Warberton with an incredibility in January transfers
Despite the opinions that it had been a few weeks ago, who assumed that he had determined some of the purposes of the Janewar Transfers, Mark Warberton's boss would not believe that he would not want to disrupt the one of the team.
The former Brandford attacker said, "The Janvarian transmission window is very different from the air window."
What happens to players coming ago, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group in this season.
The command works really well.
Sometimes more of the players are added to those you really need.
The "Seltrick" meant the end of the career
The attacker of the "Suncy" Mitch, who was associated with "Seltic" during the transmission window, claimed that he could leave football after the end of his contract with "Lebbys".
A 29-year-old player suffered the problem with a boat for two years, and he couldn't leave Wales this year.
Harts will resist the SFA in the conduct of Neilson's statements
"Harts" tells the number 2:1, when Patterson was removed, and started playing 3:2, but the red card of the protector was quickly cancelled; this is the third red Card Coll, annuled in eight months.
Neilson doesn't reject his words, saying, "I haven't doubted the ethics, I'm not a comment of the game."
Griffits swore to avoid Tyncasl
The arrested player of the "Hebernian" team received a complaint after he admitted that he sang a song on the words of the former "Harts" player of Rudy Scacela.
The incident occurred in the area of Rouzbern in Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh district in Taiwansle in March 2014.
"This was a darbie, and it was a burner," said the attacker, "I can be sure to say that I wouldn't return to Taynax if he doesn't play for "Seltic".
Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is sure in the Dani Younaite manager.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Director's Board of Dani Younaite continues to be sure that the managers team will change the situation to the best, but it agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field should be completed.
I think Steven Tompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the guys to get out again," Donnelly said.
Makinnes is glad that "increasingly" wins from "H'ilton"
Derek Makinness admitted that Aberdin's team had to be deceived to fight against "H'ilton Assis" to gain the seventh victory in the first line of the ligue, which set them on five points above "Seltic", above the tourist table, thanks to Adam's Runey's sandal in the first time.
Inneses said, "Not a team that would win anything, a cubo, or a ligue championate who didn't win the meetings like this."
The Level without Shotland is not changed, while it is in the United Kingdom in general
BEZBOTICE in Scotland remained 164 000 people for the period from May to July, while the number of non-United Kingdoms in general increased by 10 000 to 1,82 million for the same period.
The level of unnecessary in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than 5.5 per cent of the United Kingdom, as shown by the national statistical numbers (ONS).
At the same time, the employment in Scotland has fallen to 12 000 people in three months, while the number of employees now is 2 612 000.

It was almost a year since Scotland decided to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Labour market in Scotland in the growth of employment and decreasing unemployment.
Why I am a Witness of the Penalty in Oklahoma
Today, from the jurisdiction, I'll be able to see how humans are punished.
If that happens, and I hope not yet, I'm gonna sit on a looking gallery of the cameras in the state of Oklahoma when Richard Glossip will be punished with death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
First, this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I had faith in chock, I agreed.
With the nearest day, I'm afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed, because it's a good way to tell the detailed story of the punishment.
This would offer a unique cancer.
Yes, the journalists are allowed to be in charge of punishes in America, and, since they often want more than − the results of the dark lottery will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the quantity of presses was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever has been selected, he'll look at it without emotions.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've come up with him after a few months of telephone sounds and one visit for two and half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The Administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a block and a hand to write what I see.
I need to try to make all details.
One journalist of Oklahoma accused me to your owner that I was doing my independence.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, you get access.
I welcomed her.
She admitted that she could "better form," but she still believes I'm wrong to do what I do.
Richard Glossyp didn't agree with what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that, even if he had spoken.
I told him he could get me out of his shot of witnesses at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international issue to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that the voice will help the movement to dismiss the penalty.
Kim Belver, reporter from Haffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the subcasts I've written.
I'm not gonna be here in detail again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossyp is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of crime.
But I believe that there is a great chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I am strongly sure that the doctrine of the court was not sufficient.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And from this cancer I'll see how he'll die.
I can't say that I'm totally objective.
There will also be other reporters to which it can be addressed.
From me you'll know how it is to see how a man I like dies without need.
The following half of humans have agreed to go out of the Canning River
I'll consteb from the town of Canning Wayle to convince a man to get out of the Canning River, and to stay soft.
The people of Perta intended to get out of the police, but it wasn't stuck, but he was thrown in a bullet water for a few metres from the police officer who was trying to "contract him to go out to the Âg".
Canning Wayle police were called on Thursday on the fact of illegal proliferation to a strange territory in Bakingham.
When the police noticed a suspicious, he tried to get away from them and left to Canning.
But he hasn't fallen far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, come on, get me," said the senior Sergeant Chandell Casldain.
Constable Laclan Perhavece was not very wanted to mock the form, so he said a more safe receipt -- "conversations with good police."
"The people sometimes do strange things to try to escape," says Sergeant Casldan.
That's exactly that's the football-champion Ben Cazins.
In 2006, Cazins went to the cow to avoid meetings with the police patrol for alcohol checking and tried to cross Suon.
His efforts were to be free, but the people moved to get the "Ben Kasin's biaton".
Peter Mudi accuses the stars to try to spy and threatens to get out of the horse
Peter Mudi accused Racing Victoria's staff in trying to introduce a spion into his horse in the past year and threatened that he would immediately leave the horse sport.
His mixture became stewards and ethics Racing Victoria, which he accused that they organized a campaign personally against him, and the recording from Lady Tatai's start because of the rules of use on the starting day, in the middle of the lady, became the last salmon.
Mudy reported Fairfax Media that he always illustrates all the efforts involved in sculptures, and he proved to be in a difficult situation when it came to the local result of the leader's test on the cobalt, which he could not explain.
He kept the language of suspiciousness in a spying for half years and didn't want it to look like green wine.
"I wasn't going to talk about this, and I was long-term, but sometimes it makes you out of the choice that you're not holding it anymore," said Mudy.
They know that it was going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm gonna sleep strongly.
I want to walk with the high-heighted and I want my owners to know that I do everything possible for them.
When they start thinking that's wrong, then I'll have to stop being a trainer.
Then I'll have to think what to do with my license.
Earlier, Mudy sent sensationally stated during the interview on racing.com that the ethics tried to spy at his horse.
"Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart were sitting in a comma with a man I'll call if they ask him and offered him in my coast to send information about what I'm doing in the coast," said Mudy on Racing.com.
They're clearly thinking I'm a mosquito.
If so, all of them should certainly have statements because the trial of me has not succeeded.
Robert Rollstone, former President of RVL, David Mudi, current President of RVL, and Bernard Sandry, the External Executive Director of RVL, knew about it all the time and now.
Does this not make me think that the matter becomes personal?
Should RVL not be courageous and call for the answer of what is happening in this business, other people, other than trainers?
Do I feel bad for this profession?
Is I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people think that's right there.
Maybe they have to take my license and let me go, and I don't doubt what I'm saying now, may cause them to think about it.
But I've come to the point where I'm worth it now, and it's gonna hurt me.
I'm really cruel about that.
I will press them and give them the responsibility for decision-making.
I have a family support, and I can go.
The trainer has only grown in a long investigation of the case with the cobalt and the Leader, and the latest recording of the ships from the start of him to say that he can "scale his licence on the table".
Muddy, mostly by preparing an inconveniable black Caviar chamber, called for the use of medical medicinal products on the day of the "smoking" performance after a compression from the glace was made on the feet of the loach, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on shocks.
"I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my mistakes made her a compromise on her feet.
She could get a compromise last night.
She could get him yesterday as it was.
She was with him on the fucking day.
Muds may be discovered for three months in order to apply medical medicinal products on the day with the use of a compromise, which caused the studies to be opened.
It's anecdote.
People who create these rules don't know anything about the wounds.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's been too far," said Mudy.
The leader who has made up and hidden from the place of the event in Cobrama, arrested
Police was arrested by a man who was thrown into the outside of Cobrama and hided from the place of the event.
Moto's offered to the hospital at Royal Melbourne with serious hurt after the car hit him on Murray Walley Hayway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver was gone without stoping to help the vulnerable motorist.
On Monday, the 50-year inhabitant of the city of Natalia was assigned to the police in Shepporton.
It is supposed that he will be accused of leaveing the place of events, non-assistency and other road movement rules.
Moto, the 40-year-old Cobrama inhabitant, remains in the hospital in a stabil state.
Melbourn Storm Trainer Craig Bellami is charged by the complainants in the application of strong force receipts
The Milburn Storm trainer Craig Bellami called the criticism of the catching of the sword by his team as a "day agenda" by the two favorites of the NRL campaign.
The Trainer of Sydney Rusters, Trend Robinson, stated that the judges allowed "Storm" to fight" with his team during the "Storma" finally winning in Sidney on Friday evening.
The Brisbane Broncosse trainer Wayne Bennet made a clear finding on Storm after his team wined the final kwalk of the tourist at Nozern Queensland Cowboys on the Sabbath night when he called this game "typical" for the regby line and stated that two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in the handshop.
Bellami protected the capture of the sword by his team and stated that they were just focused on the "contakt" with the catch.
Bellami added that he had the confidence of the criticism of his team from two leaders, since it means that they were concerned about the possibility of the "Storm".
"I haven't heard that the Trend Robinson talks about serious receipts when they played us with 24:2," said Belami in the middle.
I can recommend that we have not changed anything any year in our systems or technical protection, just in the last six weeks we have given attention to contacts when we were taking the sword, and this has become a turnover moment for us.
Three years ago, the trend is clearly trained by a different team, so he probably has not been used to play, and it has become a few challenges for him.
It's funny how this always appears in this year.
Bellamy had the idea of Bennett about the "impressioning football" to his teacher that "St. George-Ilavarr Dragons" Bennett was won in the campion in 2010, "soft" football.
Wayne's talking about a fucking football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening, and see how impressive it was their game," said Belami.
I remember that in 2010, "St. George" had been criticized by calling a nice team, and Wayne said that it would not forget him.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks as an impressive football, especially his young protectors with their speed.
It's a football you want to play when you have such players.
He made this note in 2010, and now he wants all to play football in his style -- not every team has two protectors like Anthony Millford and Ben Hunt so they can play.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because some of them are worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they reached great games.
Bellami also noted that the Storma and Rusters game was consistent with a large number of points than the Broncos and Cauboyz game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the account? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two other trials - and what, is it a impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and failure attempts?
It's for me.
If they mention us, it means that we can meet them there at some stage.
"Storma" at the end of this week of outcome, since they wined the right to accept North Queensland Cauboise, or "Cronal Sharx" on Saturday evening at the AAMI Park stadium, the billets will be sold on Thursday morning.
Insured in the preservation of drugs, Serb is charged for $20,000
A man who threatened to have a livelihood conclusion for a trial of 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland contraband was issued for $20,000.
Marco Simovic, 29 years old, was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drugs in the Solay jacket, a sixth of South America through Vanuatu and in Kumera in August.
During the morning, the council and his companions saw them in the coffee of Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the risk of the deteriorated time for the trial of consumption of drugs in a sufficient quantity of sales, the chairman claims that the evidence of the fact that the last tried to get the whole party is not available, and that a man could be in the coffee without any sense.
The Court of Auditor Peter Flanagan doubted that the Court of Auditors should be released.
There are recently contacts with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the court in the middle.
In the course of a vote, he lying to the police about his finding.
The mothers and the family were proposed to bring a total tax of $20,000 for the exemption.
"Beyond the evidence that the amount of $20,000 is too large financial burden for them," noted the Court of Justice.
However, one of these measures is not sufficient as a guarantee that the judge has added to it.
It was allowed to be released under charge by providing his Australian and Serbian passport to be noted at the police every day and to observe the commanding hour from 6 hours ago to 6 hours tomorrow.
Fotis Cacicaris: "I'm gone by Greece, who was fighting for the last seconds."
The main trainer of Greece Fotis Cacicaris granted his team after the 1/4 final robasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to his statement, the games were determined from where the errors were decided.
It was a big game, quoted by AFP Cacicaris.
We were prepared for a great game in the performance of the Spanish.
They tried to defense, but the errors in the defence were determined by the meetings.
It's funny, but I'm proud of my boys.
They were fighting until the last second.
Joel Friend: "I'm going to be in the CSCA's functions of Kawan."
The CSCA Joel Friend said he didn't believe in the fucking army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and the end of winning a royal in the season.
I talked to Dr. Dimitris Itudis several times this year and, just after I joined the team, he cited the R-Sports of Friland. - I actually will have the functions of Sashi Kawan, who left the team, as well as in the appeal from a three-second zone, and I think I'm going to do that.
Yeah, I need some time to change the central position, yet I played more forward in the NBA.
Now it's going to be to be more opposed to the big center, but I've already been doing this before, so I think, and I'm going to do it now.
The Armies finally wined the Royalgue in 2008.
Since they arrived six times to Final four, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
It's supposed to be somebody's voting on the team.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand all the disappointment of the club and his sick ones.
But we have a different team now, and if we show the best to what we can, we have a good chance to win ́roligue, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the mosquitoes have already run into the tour, and I think this year will be a year of CSK.
What's going on, I'm not a superstitious man, and I don't believe any shit.
I believe in the hardness and determination, if you associate these two things, it is possible.

Stephen Hog repaired the girl's phone to make pedofils send graphs
The pedofil was phoned by the 11-year-old girl to ask for violence against children.
Stephen Hog took a girl's phone while she slept, registered to the Internet service, where she received a number of inappropriate pictures of children sent to him by other users.
The girl was wake up, found the phone crash and found it in the hand of the Hogga sleeping.
She checked it and found shocking graphics, and then she turned her mother's attention to it.
The police came and saw five images, then investigated the computers found on this address, and found the "compliant" requests in the search system using words for the discovery of inadequate images of children.
Hog then declared to the police that he did it, because it could be "to pedophiles" and then he would "conceive that he was a policeman to be afraid of them."
The authorised executive Elide Robertson reported to the Sheriff Court in Dani: "He said that this is an adversity, he was endangered to fear people.
He admitted that he had made requests on the computer, but he said that it was because he wanted to be arrested by the police to fear pedofils.
He was asked by the conduct of a non-person who sent him, and he asked to send further graphs.
He said he was doing this to deceive them.
He said he had problems with his drinking and said he wanted to see violence and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When a girl found the phone graphs, she called her mother, kissed and wept.
She saw an inappropriate chair on the phone, and then the accused one was charged with the accused.

He did not suffer, but the videographer with the fall scene was currently spread on the networks.
The opening of the parliament was also denied by the parliamentary opponents' statements that they had anonymous threats to warn them of the promotion of Mugabe during the treatment.
For months ago, they made the president in his relation to the nationality in the Parliament, and Mogabe repeated on Thursday.

In this same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two registered companys by manufacturing computers and printers from rapidly developing equipment and services sectors.
The calculations resulting from the estimated reduction of slaves are about 2,7 billion dollars, starting from the fourth quarter, stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
"The rest of this tourism will ensure a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise company," said Mag Whitman, President and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will address the body after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more concentrated than Hewlett-Packard now, and the business portfolio will be larger and deeper to help the company to move to the new business style," said Witman.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than 50 billion dollars each year and will "concentrate on the delivery of previous incomplete technological solutions" to companies, reported in the company's statement.

The Captain of Arsenal Michael Artet says that his colleagues should support the traumatised Jack Wilshire before playing with Dinamo Zagreb
In the context of Wilshire and Wenger, he also stressed that only September, and that if Wilshire's rebuilding is planned, he will not have anything to stop returning to Christmas' games.
With the most favourable development of Wilshire's events, at least four games in England will be lost and, taking into account, its participation in the campaign will remain under question for a year.
The most most recently in this problem is that Wilshire was sure that he had completed the previous season with the only trauma and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during the pre-second preparation.
"This trauma doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not until the end of the living bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a accident.
It's not with ships or traumatisms that he had before.
These may be medical things, but, as Hunger also allowed, there is a risk of additional trauma for any player who returns to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also a disadvantaged trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has fixed 23 different traumatisms that occurred with him in six years of debute.
Moreover, he played only in 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the last five seasons.
If you look at the "Arsenal" layout, you can note that in the six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier Liga Clubs, most of which the most expired by the trauma of days.
Hunger recognises the probability of encouraging in the round, but the " Arsenale" believes that the improvement of trauma statistics in the last season will continue.
"It is sometimes, when you return to the stage after the traumatism, you're being vulnerable for some time -- for this time you need to restore powers and make competitive advantages," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough, and he's gonna do it.
I hope he's gonna restore physically, I'm sure that his career will be the way he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign in the Champions Lige in the middle of the "Dinomo-Zagreb" and continues it on Saturday games with "Chelsy" and in the environment - with "Tottynh" Hotspur, and Hungary's mouth.
Ector Belerin and Aaron Remzy did not come to Croatia, so most in the beginning they would play Debushi Mother and Artet.
Wenger may also include Kiran Gibbs and Olivia Giru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a small transfer to the players that need it," Wenger said.
Although the "Arsenal" is unconditional in the F group, the "Ma·мир" stage in Zagreb will be the number of most involved in the group.
"Dinamo" didn't lose any of the 41 mads from the pairs how they had been able to perform the last season as "Invisibles".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium had the effect of the earth's power of 3,2 balls on the Richtra scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Hungar assured that Arsenal had taken a lesson received last season when the team had suffered a hurt in Monaco Championian Liga, and remained hoped to bring a club to win in Cubka's final campion.
"This is an incredible driver," Wenger noted.
Arsenal has never done that yet.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a stageman.
We've got ambitions, but we're not murderers.
FriendsFest: a comedic show that gave us serious lessons of husband's friendship
The absence of such stories is given in the eyes, especially if the deception of the need for men in the openness is now more than ever, while the level of suicide among young men is located on maâmuma for 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only biggest cause of death of men between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and men were three times more often than women.
In an attempt to discover the issue of the "Firms against Injury" announced in 2015 for men to leave the call for a culture that does not allow men to be helped when they need it.
The friend is in the center of this battle to take this call.
The recent study of more than 2.000 universities who demonstrate depression symptoms has shown that if the patient has sufficiently a large number of friends of "normal," the possibilities for treatment are devastated.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the round of soully healthy friends reduces both the possibility of being mental disorders.
But, of course, to work friendship, first to be it.
At the time when communications are managed by networks, when the style prefers to contain, the speed of response is often higher than the content of the contact.
Our digital life encourages the need to look like a strong, loving pleasure and successful, even if the unity is in reality.
Such superficial success depends on that psychologists call out external values of money, imatge, status, full account of internal prices, our internal effort to individual growth and friendship, which is more affecting our mental health.
And, as one recently noted, a video player, you don't buy any more happiness for money.
The worth of Friends is that they have attached this attention.
Each of the persons had not been determined by its own, but, more than by the person who had been associated with friends.
Jumor Joey and the continuous volumes of Chandler, the moments of watching the football on good stones, the relief of Ross on Rachel -- all comes from understanding that men can feel that, even if they are often detained from the full investigation of their feelings.
As "Samaritens" said to me, "My role of listener for people who feel depression and su·da’s advice stresses how even the smallest community of friends can benefit."
Often men who turn to us feel that they are not able to talk to friends.
An old learning of "life with this" is very much as the feeling that the manifesting of problems can be recognised as the ability."
Friends one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to perform more longer working overall mechanisms.
It highlighted the little moments of a husband's friendship.
What my task is, the status of the foreign talking on the phone helps people at the time of discouragement, the long-term support and the closer area of family and friends.
If you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central in these outcomes, where you have completely restored decorations for the festival, why not take your friends to drink in Central Perk.
Or better, if you see a single man in Starbucks, let's smile and say "Hey."
Do not imagine what kind of friendship can benefit from before.
Serial Friends are on Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, in the #FriendsFest
Di Maria forgets the goal, helping the "SH" to disgrace "Malmoo"
Angel di Maria, like Blaz Matthew and Edison Kawani, celebrates the murdered murder in Malmoah gate.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champion's Ligue, killed a goal as he allowed the "PJ" to be easily running "Malmoo" on Thursday.
This is the report on the mad and the reaction of the game.
Angel di Maria and Edison Kawani did their work when Pary San Jerman started their game in the League Champions with extremely favourable winning 2:0 against "Malmeo" at Park de Prens stadium on Thursday.
Di Maria killed a bowl less than four minutes after its first game in the League Championans as a PJ player, to set the direction to the French champions, but they lost a number of minutes before they finally increased their advantage when Kawani killed the goal for 61 minutes.
In addition to Real Madrid and Shahter's daughter in the group A, "Pari" had to take a good start in the game against the championers of Sweden, because they were invited not to the kwality of play-of, but to continue a series of successful games in the last three seasons, where they were up to four finals.
They took the points, but there was not the best decision by Loran Blan to count the Golden Ibrahimovich in the attack and later to replace it on the field in the game against the team of his family city and the club in which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win houses or guests in the Champion Ligue, so to gain a winning account 2:0, to provide problems to the partners and to play a good game in protection, it is a good beginning, even if there are more moments that we will need for the season," said Blan.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I'm sorry that we didn't lose one or two more bottles.
Ibrahimovic returned after the traumatism in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her neck with the number 2:2 in the "Bordo" catch in the first League, but revoked him at the back of the De Maria plan for a fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker noted as a player able to bring "SH" to a new level in the Property, after he was sold at Manchester Younaited last month, and he proved why, when he fled from Marko Verratty behind the protection of "Malmeo" and finished the attack by sending the stone out of John Willand to the remote gate.
However, if someone had expected a simple and big victory, they had to be disappointed.
"Malmeo", who wined Seltic in play-of to reach this stage, having a serious opposite of nine world players at the beginning of the game, five protectors and two opposers in the middle of the field.
But except the attack of Nikola Jurdich, where the bottle passed through the remote stanger gate Kevina Trappa for 34 minutes, they attacked a little bit.
Thus, the PSH has in times of an unresolutional transfer and attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who just in the first half had not been able to make at least five trials, and then he has not been able to put on the coat killed by Kawani after the renewal of the game.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more smart in precise pastures, and it was a feast from Ibrahimovich, received that, De Maria sent a football with a frozen struggle, which passed by the stangs out of Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally killed after a hour mark by the Kawana, the Uruguay killed his sixth foot in the season after Ibrahimovic sent the meat to the centre of the field with the left floor.
This ended with any ideas that had the "Malmeo" to return to the game, and only the throat of Viland's sword from nearby distance did not allow David Louis to increase the counterparty before the exhibition of Esekiel Lavesis was not counted as a goal in the top of the mad.
Age Harayde's trainer later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norway said, "We have been playing in the Champion Ligue in December of the past year."
We just played in the Swedish League, and that's not the level.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Thanks to Pari!
It was a wonderful bitch with them.

Economy News → Nobel Laureat: Globalisation
The printing of the globalization processes should have contributed to the reduction of the inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation seems different, the difference in the income of the population in the development of economics, in turn.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-qualificated slaves, considering the primary scientific of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Selection of Decisions of NIU US, the Laureat of the Nobel Economy Premium 2007.
In the past twenty years, the world has survived the unexpected growth of global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more open.
Globalization of the prognoses has great benefits for the development of the economy.
"And these predicts have been in a lot," stresses Maskin.
Thus, for example, China and India have received a serious increase in UNDP for the soul of the population.
However, it is not all so happy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the loss between the "employed" and the "involving" countries in poor countries, which appeared in great inequality of income, and more precisely the payment of work.
But in fact, this inequality was just increased, noted by Eric Maskin in its article "Why the global markets have not reduced the inequality in the development of economics," published in the World Bank Economic Review, which has translated and quoted the NYE US.
Along with the economy, Professor of Harvard University Michael Crémer Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the difference in income in poor countries is increased as a globalization increase is noted by the US US.
Specific processes occur on the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, the Maskin is assigning four levels of quantities - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After globalization of the D professionals from the poor countries, there is no sufficient quantity level to cooperate with the A and B experts from the rich countries.
And if the C levels of payment from the poor countries have been able to cooperate with the B of the rich, the D growth does not feel or their payments are totally undergone.
The effectiveness of the internationalization of production will contribute to increase the distortion in the payment of work between two categories of professionals in poor countries and to increase the level of inequality.
Crémer and E. Maskinami have been proposed a wonderfully beautiful model, an alternative risk theory of comparative benefits.
It allows it to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, - says Fuad Aleskers, an ordinary Professor, leading to the International Analysis Laboratory and the election of decisions, the department of the Matema Department of NYU US.
And as a powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to the enlargement of the Pyricals in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-qualificated slaves.
However, as the scientist notes, it does not have any funds, but it is unfair for companies to pay their training.
In such situations, governments, NGOs and private funds may be considered as a significant role.
The scientist notes that in any case the theory is not calling for the rest of the globalization process that brings and brings its fruits in the form of growth in the countries.

The United States State in Moscow is deeply sorry for the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Employment Centre to the Universal Public Library. M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.

Thefft said that some years ago was decided to close another Russian-American draft - a FLEX educational exchange programme (Future Leaders Exchange Programme).
The Green Court stated to the debate.
Typical situation: Four of the officers stand before the table of the judge of Swater Kumar, listening to his claims to the processed.
The court is not perfectly satisfied with your work quality.
We did not give you a 110-page offer that you might be comforted over it, says Kumar.
If there's any other kitchen, we'll order to carry out all the buildings.
Kumar is appointed by the National Green Court (NZT) of the Court of Justice established in 2010 in order to stop the environmental pollution that leads to a cruel economic growth in the past decades.

They are also trying to not forget about people: for example, during the discussion of the pharmaceutical company in the Tellagnan State, which threatened the ftorid river.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for economic consequences.
"The people lose" is a comment on their decision of Kumar.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding in simple people who can change life by one crushing of the judge.
