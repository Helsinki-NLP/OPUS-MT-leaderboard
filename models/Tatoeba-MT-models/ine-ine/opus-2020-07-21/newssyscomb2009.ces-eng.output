Triumf of the rights of the people in Scotia, inherents have 29 percent
The sensitive deficiency of both sides of large coalition and significant strengthening of the rights of the national parties has brought the preliminary Parliamentary elections in Russia according to the first preliminary results.
In particular, strong losses suffered by the Rakousian Peoples Party, where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously distorted.
Instead, the electoral leader of Swazi for the future of Rakouska (BZÖ), the Korean leader Jörg Haider ch makes a triumphal return to the national policy.
According to the preliminary results, the most violent part of the social democracy country (PPE) remains with 29.8 per cent of votes against the last elections of 2006, however, the loss of 5.5 per cent of votes will be lost.
More worse, the UVP was lost by 25.6 per cent, at least nine per cent of votes.
These are the worst results of both these biggest parties in the Russian military history, and especially in people who have previous elections, are a katastrofal result.
On the beginning of July, when ÖVP came out of the coal, people had a significant shock before the SPÖ.
The lovers, however, have apparently disturbed them because they have left the government to consume.
In the first reactions on the results, speculations have already been introduced to the possibility of the president of the party and the responsibility officer Wilhelm Molterer.
The observators judge that this could be done on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the presidential party.
This development would obviously facilitate the road to the most probably east of the electoral output, so to restore a large SPUE and ÖVP coal.
In the light of the strengthening of both rights of the people - freedom (FPÖ) have already received 18 per cent and 11 per cent of the votes - but the social democratic have also expressed the fear of the reaction in 1999 when people have agreed with the people (and the FPÖ was still unique, in 2005 the BZÖ was rejected) to the common government that even called a sanction from the European Union.
For this development, apparently, has Haider, who has already declared that it is ready to cooperate with any side and intends to return to the United States Policy.
The Green Party has yet been in Parliament, but it has easily lost and fallen between the Russian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No of the other parts of the four-percent border has apparently overcome and has been missing to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Vztahy with India can be kicked
It would not be possible to resolve the problem with the Czech doctors who were accused of the illegal collection of browsing in India, it would, according to the Czech Ministry, be held by Karla Schwarzenberg for a certain covering of the Czech and Indian relations.
The Minister introduced it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian Protestant Pranab Mukherdji.
"If it hadn't been solved, then yes, then it would have come to a certain refrigerator," he concluded after a meeting that followed from the Czech initiative.
The Mukhardji after negotiation said that in the cases of courts it could be very difficult to include.
However, he noted that in the case of Petra Svachy, who was forbidden of the accusations and was sentenced by repentance, the Central Government may act with the local government in Darjiling, in which the matter falls in the jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," Minister said.
For Emila Kuchera, a three-year period of adoption, it would be the best to revoke to the higher instance, according to Mukhardžy.
Then he could ask for the release of the cup and wait for a judgment for freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also was in the process.
"He recommends a revocation to the highest court, then it would be possible to mislead it," said the Czech diplomacy boss.
On the only way the Czech party can enter into the whole of the matter is to provide "competitive legal aid", said the Indian Minister.
In addition, he said that such a help already provides them by the side.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India that have a year old tradition.
Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
In addition, as the CTK said, before his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic added to the problem of the Czech Entomologists a major importance.
"We consider the truth as a deep mill of prison and excuses of these Czech doctors," he declared.
The answer to the question of whether he received the promises from the Indian side to take care of the matters, the Minister was dismissed.
"I've already got a lot of promises," he just stated.
That judges the fight against the sea bottom
It is accessed to the semi-electronic map that is shown in Australia and in the sea.
But he is not interested in the continent, but a little point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with him, and the coming sea bottom.
Instead, the area is great as a single continent," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuoso, who belongs to the thirty-first work team of the United Nations division for marine and maritime rights.
His boss, director of divisions, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulk, follows the explanation and sometimes completes.
He's ruled by this work, the elan and the surprise.
The sea bottom is hiding a little known world, rich to natural resources.
There can be adequate rubber, wheat and other irrelevant sugars, but not yet known living organisms that do not have the key to develop drugs against cancer.
Downer than pe’n
The border states today have started a new sub-seater territory.
According to the United Nations Convention, it also uses its rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly about the so-called continental shelf, which often seems about a hundred miles from the south of the country.
It has an exceptional sentence to all the sources of the continental shelf, according to the contract.
"It is simply taken, for the continental shelf, this part of the sea's day and its foundations, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
Saha beyond the border of the southern sea, often along the border of two hundred miles of sea, etc. exclusive economic zones," explains Miculka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the limitation of the external border of the continental shelf must be submitted by the detective technical documentation based on a number of cost reviews and measurements.
It's an exhibition of a number of years of ready work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has yet committed five requests, which are Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
There are only three recently mentioned countries," adds Miculka.
The World Voice mentioned recently the success of Australia, which, firstly, extended its sub-sealand countries.
But he also received New Zealand - the sea-day division, which the Commission has admitted last week, is about 1,6 million miles [4,6 million] miles [4,500 km], so the amount of six times more than the size of the State alone.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in investigation.
The winning that will bring to them in the future from the use of the sea's day will be unappreciable, as they promise.
Its requests shall also be made progressive and other States.
They can do so until ten years since they've been "contracted with Montego Bay".
There, where the continental shelf ends, starts the ocean day, announced by the contract for "the common inheritance of mankind".
There is no exceptional position here.
The right of charges in this Area shall be granted by the Convention by the international institution established.
"The Sea Down but there is no Klondajk", says director Miculka, with the fact that his "social ships are legally determined and their regime is contractually covered."
Czech Republic
The part of the sea day today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are concerned with other states of some east blocks in the Common Interoceanmetal Organization.
This was obtained in 1991 in accordance with the contract, as the investors of some other States, the status of the "professional investor".
He has the right to weigh in the area of Clipperton in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
Investor's investigated is something more important than the former Czech Slovenia.
It's a member there, it's a cool sub-sea-replication Tater.
"They can be weakened on the table with a total range of 75,000 miles of quadrimeters.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetallic specifics containing nickles, ears, cobalt and mangans," states the next lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian division officer Rober Sandev offers a show of such a particular.
At a small bramber or at a little fantasy, a terrible team that, according to the legends, survived Golema.
Dutch special settlement units were released by handmans
The Egyptian Government requested a solution to crisis with hands to help from Germany - experts adopted.
When the departure was deteriorated, special units were prepared, but it did not come to the settlement.
More details of the situation of the 11th freedom of European tourists in Egypt are made available to the public.
Dutch special forces have also participated in salvation, according to the data of the Minister of Defense and inside.
According to the Minister's exhibition, the social military experts and the German Anti-Terrorist Group of GSG9 were on the place of freedom, the social criminal office and the technical aid logistics of the Technical Aid Service.
However, according to the further communication of the speakers, both ministers from Monday afternoon did not need German forces, because the entities left their prisoners to go and dismiss when they broke the signs of violent release.
The Egyptian government accepted aid offered by Germany as a supporting force for action at the place.
"There wasn't done," said one of the speakers of the social ministries inside.
The attackers brought a group of travelers from five Germans, five Italians, one Romans and eight of their Egyptians on September 19, South Egypt.
After the income in the wilderness in the south of Egypt, the hands were moved in the regions between Egypt, Libya, South and Chad.
The contributions remained unexpected at the last time, as well as the details of the freedom or the possible payment of the redemption.
Now the salvation is all right in Cahira.
Minister Steinmeier said that the freedom of hands is to take care of the German ambassadors.
He didn't give up the details of the release.
There are no information available to Berlin when the salvation is back to Germany.
According to the "image" list, all five tourists should also fly with special forces by one of the Airbuss of German airport and get to Germany.
American Sneemov Representative refused the salvation package
The American Congress's room allowed a closely rate to fall a safe packet for the financial markets in value of $700 billion.
Index Dow Jones has fallen strongly.
In relation to 206 to 227 votes, the US Snemvna rejected the Governing Board of Financial Markets.
Without all the challenges of the American President George W. Bushe and both sides of the chief policies, there was no importance for a programme to reduce chaos on financial markets.
The dramatic action was attempted to convince the critics of the packaging value of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the vote of a lawyer to make a statement of agreement, even though the plan, as he said, was not an anniversary.
"It is difficult to obtain political recognition for the elimination of something that has not yet been done," he admitted.
During the vote, the index Dow Jones passed over six percent, or 600 points.
It was the fear of investors that the State salvation package could fall.
Soon before the end of the vote, the index value was indicated that after the notice of the package consumption, it would return to the end of the vote.
The experts are now counting with other serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to enable the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to agree with the Snow Representatives and Senates.
Travel of agencies
It seems that winter will be good for German businessmen in the way of movement:
According to one study, in the booking of interests for the next month, in comparison with the previous year, it increased explicitly to the worm even more than 30 per cent.
During a weak economic growth, Germans have the pleasure of traveling unexpectedly.
In the reservation for winter, the Offices mentioned the road of rotation increase by 31 per cent in the same period of the latest year as the German road’s association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, there are also increased booking numbers available for sub-term months.
Thus, according to the exemption of the DRV, in October in comparison with 2007, there was about 11 per cent higher.
The basis for these results is GfK numbers, which evaluates data on reservations from 1200 German travel offices each month and interpolates them on the total market.
In this outcome, the reservations of interests were included until the end of August 2008.
For a weak course of dollars, they are requested in the main way to the United States, he introduced the DRV.
On these roads, it makes a higher reserve for about one third.
In addition, Germans are particularly requested for Spain, Turkey and Greece and homewater.
The above-organised interests are in the course, the President DRV Klaus Laepple declared.
In view of the costs of energy and food, the costs "for the customer's customer are counterable than for individually organised.
Laepple explained that money is possible for those who are concerned otherwise to protect the use of the skills for the timely booking or all-ursive offer.
Even in the years, the number of reservations was very good, so in comparison with the previous year, it will be a higher turn - even though, according to another study, the number of Germans who have undertaken along the road, in comparison with the previous year has decreased.
My first feast of October
Donekone’s repeated cup, birds of tubs and prominents in the crowns of known farmers.
First on a pivot.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have too much common.
She's a blond, a TV modernator, and he's wearing an earlier circle.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my shot's out of the secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on a drink, and we're already faced with photographs, and we're stumbled with memory cards - it's my trouble, I'm first on October.
That's how you can be friends.
It seems that my left crown has fulfilled his chair.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the clobase rock, and so my feelings were more comfortable in the cross.
But just after the arrival to Theresienwiss, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone has a female crown or a skin hole; no one looks disappointed or deceived - everything is totally normal.
Specific views on the banana station in the chocolate are just my guards.
One Mnichovanka warns me that I was wrongly linked to her, "You're free to the left, to the lady, to the lady, to the right back."
They're getting over to the back to the left.
"Good," he says and smiles.
Others with subtil flirting technicians are so immortal and they have a simple plastic bullet with the title "This drunk is get dressed!" and stretch on the surrounding of the backs.
A young man with such exhibitionists named Bob, he came from England and in October.
He looks like "gorgeous", with a long-term "hoo".
It's gonna tell me what you've got about a just drunk maz.
Just next to one of those hydrants, everyone thinks it's a waste.
Thus, Bob is one of the fearful "Wildbieslers", as it is said in Bavorska to the public freely powerful people.
Others have no lucky to get out of this way of alcohol.
About the eighth dinners run on the table where the October fest is covered, the healthy health careers who have to take care of the poor drinks.
Medicines appear in hejnehs - in four wears a covered weight from the apartment to the apartment.
They work as a lot of visits to drinks: empty there, filled again with the cups.
Whoever lies under the floor of this cancer from love doesn't see.
"It's the same one who can't go anymore," he's calling me in answer to my question, one of the medicals, and he's lost in the dawn.
Police published the name of the accident victim
The name of a thirty-year woman died in the hospital after she hit her car in Essex.
A disaster at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon, Carole Paulson sentence from the neighborhood Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to the Queen's Hospital hospital in Romeford, but she died later.
After a accident, a 15-year-old man was arrested to be suspected on an independent jail.
He's already been released on the police bathroom.
Turkish diplomatic areas are extended
During the time before Turkey began to try to enter into the European Union, the European power would deeply reach the Turkish limit.
On the East Mountain of Bospore, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best memories of this imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was proposed by two Germans Otto Ritters and Helmuth Conu in an unreasonable range.
Then they'll tell you the tourists.
The building is sitting around at the end of the presentation, on each corner of the front, in view of the non-resolution of the provincial German Council.
The stone's spiral.
The whole building is quietly spread.
But as long as a man gets inside a closed pocket, he can't have any doubt of the size of the business, whose most worst station was.
The station in August 1908 opened the German consortium Anatolian-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, which had been involved in the Empire game later, had in the aim of her ambition to control the Near East through this railway, which had to lead to Damask, Bagdad, and continued to the territory of Saudi Arabia today.
But the German imperial ambitions were wounded during the first world war.
They were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his imperfect units.
Relationships of isolation from the surrounding areas, combined with frozen war borders, are away
British and colonial units proceeded from Egypt and removed Turkey and their German associations from Palestinian and Syria.
And the Hydarpas station also came wrong news.
In 1917, he destroyed the exhibition of the munitional wolf of her manufactured street.
The Turkish sources say it was about the Sabbath.
Since that time, it's been deeply severe, and it's been covered by the rubbers.
However, this ship today serves in Anatolia and continues to east - at least symbolic - to enhance the areas of the Turkish diplomacy.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development - ACP - has created a completely new policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territory, combined with the frozen borders of the cold war, is away.
Now the new policy is applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatahem, with Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to examine the parameters of this new policy, I put on the nightly influence in the Turkish main town of Ankar, where I had to meet one of the former ACP experts in the promotion policy, the Turkish Commissioner Suat Kinikliogl.
Next -- about ten and a half hours of depth -- after the codry driving after the sequences that were reminded of the ancient rites of the known Night Post document, I came to Turkish metropole, designed as a new city for the secondary state, which wants to turn back to his Otoman's past.
However, the ACP with its well-known islamic roots represents the movement of the paradigma of the Turkish consensus.
At the west, she raised suspects, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the AKP main station, the ultramodered stone and powder building, aimed at developing property, circumcised half-covered business houses and trades in the power of the medium managers in business areas - men and women - meetings to make quick trade rare.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be quietly a medium-direct policy of almost every other European political party.
Sako, crazy, I'm sure he had Blackberry too.
"The objective of the policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its nearest environment.
The Study War was anonymous," he said to me.
Turkey was dismissed from his limit.
It must be looking at the east and the west, even today.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both of them.
"But I'm sure it's coming a moment," I asked, "when Turkey might have to decide?"
"Turecko," he said, "You didn't want to make such a decision."
Then he highlighted what almost everyone I spoke with here said to remember: Turkey relations not only with the Near East but also with Kwakaz and the Black Sea are the same for Europe and the United States as Turkey.
Turkey on the ground seems that Europe can, as a whole, go to the east of Asia and the Middle East.
From the Hydarpas station, after the next worst night, I thought about the two German Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu who saw how this building was built a hundred years ago.
How would they be surprised if they were surprised that European ambitions on the Middle East could now be, from a major part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting for a traquet through Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was no many doubts that the continent should have an offence on this fascinating country.
Memorial life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: As a Guildford musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, 11 September) had a filharmonic orchestrat and a congregation in Guildford.
As part of the periodic music plan, the splendid congregation of young Proteus was based on this year.
It should have been until 21 years, but at the time Proteus sang last in 1979, some of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to deliver the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (methological monarch of goods) represented the will and ability of the congregation to leave in any music that was submitted to him - whether they were madrigali or Messiaen, either with the whole orchestra.
The musical adjustment created by such a young congregation was often disappointing, exciting, and all this through the inspiration of the only man and the supervision of music that remained totally unchanged for all the time.
How often Tod told us, and-- they let music talk for themselves.
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing it! "
His taking technology was completely accurate and precise, but it wasn't even dictatoric, or increasing.
Which he had a musical standard anywhere, he still brought him up.
John Frayn Turner says:
He was supposed to be a leader passed on the rider, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he directed the Guildford philharomynical from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
That Handley had such a great combination of size and personal humility.
He hated the leaders who, according to his words, simply "sleep one or two pecks around the world."
It'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett says:
Your necrolog William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he returned to the economic story in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied to BSc, MA and PhD."
This comes from Woodruffo's note of the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not exact.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught the economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he assigned a disertation work to the British Gumaran Progress, conducted by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then issued it in 1958 as a publication of the British Gumaran Progress.
He actually worked in 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he definitively left Nottingham and passed to Illinois.
I don't know why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino in the Philosophic Faculty
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resiny "Flamenco and Life", because his documentary black photos are available.
I was surprised by the simple and powerful destruction with which it works on the roofs, and the carefulness and respect for photographed.
The idea that shows many others.
The reality can take magical moments."
Honda is attacking his bestseller
In November, Honda starts to sell the second generation of Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single space vehicle already had a significant room, now he offers a more Space internal.
In this case, improved engines are attached to increase the comfort of the driving and enable more strengthening fuel.
Evolution is more than revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, this single space vehicle has made many changes.
For example, it is necessary to mention innovative design, new platform, more dimensions and new engines.
Before we examine the new model, it is necessary to note that the new Jazz is coming on the market six years after the first generation has been introduced.
Therefore, the first thing we note is that Hunda needed a shorter period of this model than other producers.
Although Jazz is a less known model in Europe, on other markets he became a phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold for 2002 and also during the year 2008.
Just in Japan since Hondy Jazz was sold on the market, almost a million kits.
The second market became an old continent with approximately halfmillion of the sale cows in six years.
Hunda, however, claims that the new Jazz increases the sale in its category.
Then, while in 2007, this Japanese company sold to total 83,000 Hundy Jazz, 100,000 cars were estimated in 2009, which would mean growth of 17 % on the European market.
The Spanish market has been sold by Honda from 2002 to a total of 8 000 cooks of Jazz model, which means 6,7 % of the total sale of Hondy in Spain.
This is about a new generation of Jazz, the leading of the Spanish bathroom is expected to sell 2 000 kits per year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will enable Honda to expressly deteriorate the reduction of the sales in Spain.
The driving of the car so de facto expects the year to terminate with the total number of 22,000 sales, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and decreases by 16 %.
Hunda has also increased its share in the Spanish market by 1,8 %, exceeding 1,6 % from the latest year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2 %.
In order to reach this share, Honda is able to succeed in his next new model.
It is Honda Insight, the five-year hybrid compact size with a length of 4,37 metres, from which the Japanese company promises the world sale of approximately 200 000 cuss per year.
This is the market, according to the estimates of the Japanese producer, 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will divide the old continent and Japan.
The start of Hundy Insight sales is expected in the first months of the next year as the public is represented in January in Valencia.
In contrast to the first generation, the new Jazz increased all dimensions.
His length increased to 3.9 metres (only five meters more), a width of 1.69 metres (with two centimeters more) and a width of 2,5 metres, which means a length of five metres.
Instead, the eye hasn't changed and does still 1.52 meters.
Increasing dimensions also achieved increasing the internal space.
However, these benefits were achieved by using a new platform, but by storing the fuel stock of the vehicle already used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
Also the volume of the binding space - which is available to the two-day system - has increased up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the binding space in the first generation.
It is necessary to note that these dimensions are displayed in version 1.4, because the volume of the binding space at Hondy Jazz 日 is 379 litres.
Another perfection other than the external elements - such as the back LED lights or the possibility of equipment for the panoramic shield - is easier access to the back seats.
The door leader in the second row of seats allows an angle to open 80 degrees above 67 in the first Jazz model.
In the second generation of Hondy Jazz, there are new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two benzine engines 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both engines use ≥ i-VTEC that allows lower consumption, lower oxide of carbon and provides an excellent improvement of the driving system in comparison with a high precision moment in the full range of the engine surface.
The engine with a volume of 1,2 litres has 90 horses at 6000 oils with a maximum range of 114 Nm at 4 900 oils.
This engine - which had in the previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - needs 5,3 litres and 125 grams of CO2.
In contrast to the previous engine that reached 83 horses in the previous generation will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has a combination of 5,4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The "auto shooting" prevents the swimming
To progress in the development of protection against accidents, Nissan inspired me this time in nature, particularly at the night.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes for a model of flight western, and thus defends the cocktails.
This is bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in the prevention of the screen.
The Engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. developed a robot in cooperation with the Centre for Progress in the Japanese Tokyo University.
According to Kazuhira Doie, the Director-General of Public Relations for ↑ia, research and development of the label, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four areas of the Nissana security schedule.
Robots have to strengthen the ability to prevention of the wheel in the vehicles of this mark.
During the year, every night will create its own personal Area of Average Facilities, which is very like Nissana's security schedule.
The most important, however, are complied with eyes, which are able to see in all directions in a corner of more than 300 degrees, which generally allows flights in their personal space without stop.
The engineers in the creation of this visual area on what they called Laser Localizer (Laser Range Finder).
This means to calculate the distance of the given object and send the signal to the palub microprocessor, which immediately transfers it to warning before collision.
"On the moment when an interruption is mentioned, the robot will imitate the incidence of the movement and immediately change the direction of rotating the round to the right or even more corner to protect the swimming.
The biggest difference to deal with any existing system is that all moved manevas are absolutely instinct.
If it wasn't so, the robot would not be able to respond sufficiently to dismiss overcome," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, manager of the Mobile Operator and main engineer of this project.
Robots cannot be moved in the direction of the top and downside or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to the direction that is allowed to turn his round, however, in an unnecessary quantity of directions and options as at the wheel.
That is why Nissan uses the rotation, besides the destruction and destruction, to prevent the swimming robot.
"The equipment is only a couple of seconds to process information and to maintain in accordance with these data.
It does not require storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneurs, thanks to which it can work without interruption with only two tubes of kB memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't even talk about giga or mega."
This is the first step in the development of new ≥ subsequent prevention of swimming, -- where Nissan predicts use in series cars for ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer battery which are easier and maintains longer than lithium-ion.
Another future use of this section could be the building of a unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the goal and then dismiss travel transmissions.
Remember fear before taking a hypoteque
It is necessary to recognize that the Ministerial Finance of the United States, other than having enough injection for the distribution of injection, does not have any discovery.
The face in the face of crisis, and to prevent Americans from preventing risk hypotheches from banks with doubtful solvency, created a "Bad Credit Hotel" game on the Internet.
Or the "Hotel of bad credits"... or a holiday hotel.
The hotel and, especially, his receipt seem to be humiliated to think of the right moment to ask for a credit once, two times and three times.
And especially where to ask, which is probably her purpose.
It is that the game contains useful information, even if it is not too detailed.
It's a page more suitable for youth than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, there's a dream room.
At least something, because you don't talk about buying a house.
Morgan Stanley opens his MUFG
Banko's house Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, which issues nine billion dollars to gain 21 % of its responsibility. The adoption of this report has made a significant reduction in his course on the burst.
Weekly after they discovered the agreement, both banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of the current actions of Morgan Stanley for a single price of $25.25, which represents a total amount of $3 billion.
The united price is 19 % lower than the annual value of the values of papers until 31 August.
MUFG Bank invests more than six billion dollars to obtain convertible valuable papers which will ensure 10% of the cost and their change price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley highlighted that the whole operation would be performed on the basis of the average price of $29, which is 28 % under its current currency.
Action Morgan Stanley, however, lost 6,79 % and got $23.07 about $ 17.00 in Greenwich.
"This strategic association represents an important opportunity for Morgan Stanley's transition to the state of bank holding," explained John Mack, the general director of this American group.
The new statute adopted Morgan Stanley last week, which has to enable him to distinguish his activities, but it is also placed under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis has the largest axe from Wall Street to take a lot more careful access than before.
The submissions presented on Monday, otherwise, show that the agreement was changed in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it sold up to 20% of its actions to Japanese for $8,5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," explained Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director MUFG, "that our ability will be exhausted from running actions.
However, in view of the current economy and marketing, we wanted to limit the risk to minimum and also to cover."
On the basis of the estimated average prices, MUFG will pay for the value of Morgan Stanley's value by 7 % less than their annual value.
And the operation will be the result of the reduction of profits from a share of approximately 20%.
The Agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert the half of its preferential value papers to the current action for a year, if they are recently designed to change the price to 50 % exceeding the change price, e.g. by EUR 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the MUFG's holding will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance and increase its preparation.
However, the speaking group refused to provide specific information on strategic projects both of the new associates.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley would have to enjoy the proportion of the payability of Tier One about 15 %, then one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that since August, he had reduced his balance from the end of August.
The last weeks have been appealed to a group, since the course has fallen over half, while the costs against the risk of non-payment related to the amount of growth.
These costs were recovered on Monday, but they remained high, approximately 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs announced, the only "relevant" of the big investment banks Wall Street after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's purchase that she chose 15 billion dollars, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warrena Buffetta group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quit.
Replace the Republic around the socialism of the XXI century.
This is a common project of Venezuelce Huga Cháveze, Boliviace Eva Moralese and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
On the third week, the named to vote, according to the model of his prosecutors and friends, has been presented to the new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, since 64 per cent of the voters, according to the official results covered 80 per cent of votes, voted in the reference "yes".
"No" was obtained by 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0.7 % of the voice was empty.
To be accepted by the Institute, he had to get half of the voices plus one.
Two research resulted in the east of the electoral rooms and the budget of the non-governmental organizations were forwarded to the "yes" winning on Sunday, while they were identified by 63 % to 70 %.
Rafael Correa finally requested his victory on Monday night.
"The establishment wins over the entire line," he welcomed and welcomed the Ecuadors in the Guayaquil Government Side, 280 km southwest from Quita.
Itself understands that Rafael Correa has received welcome from Chaveze and Morales, but also from his Chile Province, Michelle Bachelets.
The vote, which, according to the observation of the United States Organization of America (OEA) played in peace, was regarded by the text of 444 points of "new socialism" promoted by the President.
By means of the Institute, the State's power over the economy is replaced by "the planning of development" of the country living in particular from the weight of petroleum by other companies and by the devise that sends her emigrants.
The protection of the Correau, who was chosen in 2006, also extends the power of the head of the State, which will be able to carry out two of its four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to resolve the discharge.
Correa has already announced that this power will be used and will take care of a new mandate in January 2009.
The establishment, otherwise, complies with the principle of free health and education that the president began to carry out in the country with 13,9 million people where 50% of the population lives under poverty.
Finally, it is also calculated by the prohibition of the presence of foreign armies, which will conclude the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of equador base as a standard point of American anti-drogue operations.
19 hands were released in Chad
The Egyptian command took the attack of the eleven tourists and their eighthly delivery that were taken ten days ago.
They're in Cahira.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptians who were ten days in prison in the wilderness were alive on Monday and transferred into the main city of Egypt.
During Chad, the Egyptian command was released in Chad.
The handhouses arrived around 15.30, obviously in a good form, on a special flight on the military base al-Maza, a closely neighborhood with international airport in Cahira.
They were immediately transferred without the possibility of printing, on the helikopter in the hospital in Maadi, the Cahira-resident quarter, to be detailed to medical overseers.
"They're completely broken" and "no redemption was paid to the soldiers," the Egyptian tourist minister Zoheir Garrana announced on the roadway.
Since 19 September, during the safari in the vehicle with all four rounds on the top of the Uanat mountain, in the provinces of Egypt, South and Libya, a group of hands was locked from one hidden to the other 35 unknown income.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians - and also eight Egyptians: two foreheads, four drivers, one of the directors of the Agency of Egyptus, safari organizations.
A certain representative of the Egyptian security components indicated that 30 members of the special units that approached two helicopters at the stage on the ground were expressed at the end of the night before the holiday.
"It was a shooter, half of the incomeers was killed and the ends fell out," said this source, who wanted to stay anonymously.
He pointed out that 150 members of Egyptian special forces from the "blesk" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support for German and Italian commands.
The leader of the Italian diplomatic Franco Frattini has changed from Belarus, where it is right, about the role that secret agents and directors of Italian special forces have played.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this outcome thanks professionally and effectively to people of our secret services, from special forces," he declared without further interpretation.
He also claimed that it would be paid to the redemption.
At the previous evening, the Sudanese army declared that when the guard was held the vehicle with the cart of all four rounds on which the income was located, and six killed in the case of the Chad Commander and two prisoners.
The Army claimed that they were linked to the group of rebels in Darfur, the Moving for the Liberation of the Sudan - Unit (SLA-U), which immediately refused that movement.
Letters - Culture resort silence
The debate on the financing of culture is full of the newspapers and is the subject of a pre-elective campaign.
That's better.
However, one of our cultural life is still remembered.
Who will rise to preserve the poor amounts given by small museums, and to the archaeological tombs and national memory places that kill the hunger?
Which policy is trying to remember the federal government that they remember their memories and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we have no laws that would protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has three and a half million euros to restore only Chinon's closure in Loiry valley?
Our neighbors are written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the Americans, and that this inheritance must be protected by all citizens, all the chosen representatives and all national organizations, and in the same way.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the Quebec History, at least 40 000 volunteers associated to 211 historical, memory, and genealogy for discovery of history, maintaining the homade of privacy and protecting archaeological residues from some detailed.
Often these companies are just watching dogs of our memories, which sinlessly protest when promotors and leaders leave their buldozers on old stones and forgotten graves.
When are we finally waiting for historical and memory tribes?
The Government of Benelux is part of the Fortis bank
The States of Benelux will help Belgium-Netherlands Fortis, which was first in Europe, to enlarge the crisis of the American hypothetic market, a part of the risk: three countries will support money and security institutions, which also have a share of EUR 11,2 billion in Hungary.
This week has been agreed at the highest level of the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Netherlands Government for the President of the European Central Bank and European Commissioners for Economic Concurrence.
The Bank Fortis is the first in the euro, which, in the context of the crisis of the international financial markets, has been spread in waves for a longer than a year, and the decision made in this matter could be considered in a certain way as a.k.a.
In the meaning of the decision that was born on Sunday night, all three countries will be purchased by a half (49 per cent) of the dark owner of the bank.
The Bank is totally sure to sell parts of its reservations, especially - in particular insurance - activities purchased in the netherlands bank ABN Amro.
The banks of Fortis have started to fall last week, and in the second half of the week, serious characters of the crisis have occurred in the establishment.
However, the analysers agree that the bank is too large with their 85 thousand employees to allow it to decrease.
The price papers of the company fell only on Friday by 12 per cent, at the minimum of 14 years.
From January, the value of the action was decreased by more than two thirds.
As regards the current prices of the action, the total market value of the group moves about 14 billion euros, however, it is unreal.
The management of the undertaking is finally due to the fall of the Fortis action of uncertainty on the sea market relating to the adoption of the American package plan for $700 billion.
On Monday, the action was quietly stuck.
On Friday, the bank was called a new general director Philip Dierckx.
The money institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has yet been informed.
The Government of Arabia has already announced that investors do not need to be afraid of their money.
The bank clients haven't yet been panic and the bathrooms haven't been defended by an attack.
In Hungary, the Fortis bank has a self-speed and has also spent a few leasing fires.
Snapshot in the curve
Live and health security in America on the basis of humans' data on the purchasing of medicines often provides the opportunity to close with a warranty.
The data protection experts are afraid that the data market becomes uncontrolled.
"The data protection programme is eligible for the use of the medicinal products prescribed in any case for the authorisation of the person concerned.
This must be in the hand of someone independent, Otherwise we trust the cow of the field," quotes the magazine Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of the program intended to follow the prescription of medicines.
The insurance company shall make adequate and the amounts paid in the case of certain events depending on the health status of interesters, and if the risk is evaluated as too large, the insurance shall not be closed with it.
Earlier, they were sent to medical investigations and were closed only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick had developed a much more leaving procedure: based on the identification number of the doctor's client will easily find out what medicine he bought for the last year and half, from which the programme himself results in which the disease suffers and what his health status is.
For example, if you regularly buy a large quantity of medicines for reduction of cholesterol, it refers to that practices have uncontrolledly high heat of blood tuberculosis, which will immediately include it in a higher risk category.
In the course, there are some versions of the programme, some determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so there is no job, even though it is a detailed movement.
Unfortunately, leather medicines can also be used for some, some associations, for example, are useful against migration or heat, but are eligible to depression.
They represent a significant factor of commercial security that increases the risk, where the first named is nowhere.
For requesting and processing of data, special companies were created, which were requested for authorisation before the doctor.
It is now that the authorities have already been invoked, perhaps they have not been affected because of their sustainable insufficiency.
Some companies have recently processed and analysis of studies relating to the data on the use of medicines, so that they can provide more precise pictures of the health status of patients.
The data is still more accessible, and the control of their use will continue to be more consistent.
There is a special law on the protection of health status data, but its ability is only applicable to the provider of health services and security.
The legislation which provides the authorities the authority to control and the specialised undertakings for data delivery is before the Congress.
Richard Dick recognises that it will fail: therefore, his program has developed so that data processing should be linked to the express agreement of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the relevant authorization can only be difficult to refresh, Otherwise, the security with it will not be closed.
So the blinds are just sometimes shown to the people of a good cause.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India double trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are mutual trade partners, this subject has led to other, very global problems, also the agenda of the nineth meeting at the highest level.
Today, it will also be a French and Indian summit to which it is especially to cooperate in atomic energy.
However, the European Union recognises that India is developing with the democratic power that should be given more opportunities to speak to international matters, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in the issue of the support of a permanent member of the New District in the United Nations Security Council.
This question was not yet addressed on the nineth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, respectively President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Policy of Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohana Singha, with whom they agreed that the trade would be doubled up to five years, or that you had grown to more than 100 billion euros.
Since the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 is from 25 to 55 billion, it is not a excessive ambitional goal.
In the meaning of this, for the legal view, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aircraft were sold, so green has received the future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarcose promised that the negotiations would be made.
The goal is to balance the balance, while the EU is the first business partner of India, New Dilly is between EU partners and nine.
Susmith also focused on global matters.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively terrorism - both sides in all its forms were judged and invited to call the United Nations.
They also urged to finish the road of trade negotiations from Dauha, although both have a large share in its successful accident.
The European Union confirmed that it would take place in its energy and climate programme, which would reduce damaged substances by at least twenty per cent by 2020.
In this case, India agreed, as well as that the climate of the next year would be necessary to conclude the global agreement and the production of gas resulting in reducing the steel effect until 2050 to fifty per cent.
Both parties would also prohibit the increase in the food prices and support the international calling for financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is currently engaged in the French main town, where at a bilateral meeting he wants to close the peaceful use of atomic energy trade.
Parishes that the authorisation for the establishment of Indian nuclear reactions in the value of twenty billion euros is obtained by the French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, an agreement should be valid by 15 years.

An airport found by Steva Fossett, a millioner who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the flight of Steva Fossett, a millioner, who disappeared on 3 March 2007 while flying in Nevada.
Tross were discovered at a top area of three thousand meters above the sea height, in Mamoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada, at the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human residues within the airport.
Sheriff Mader County, John Anderson, was aware of the doubts that still remained: "The air was found, we sent a team there, and now we're sure that it's exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day when he disappeared" said to one printing.
So the sheriff stated that human residues were not found in the air or in the area.
The 63-year-old millioner has been considered dead from February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) notified that a few hours after the recognition of the threat was sent to an investigation team that finally identified the aircraft: a exactly Bellanc 8kcab, which was not known from 3 September 2007 when Fossett was moved from Yerington in Nevada to the three-year year.
Yesterday, still in California, near the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal objects were found nearby one couple of their dwellings in Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois federal aircraft, money in preparation and one bond.
Searching for Fosset was cancelled month after his disappearance.
The billioner received a place in the history thanks to the long assembly of the firstborn.
In 2002, for the sixth trial, he became the first man who ended the road around the world in the air ballon: two weeks ago alone.
Three years later, the world was flying in the aircraft and without an accommodation.
Among his many records also belong to 15,445 meters high, over Andam, even though with a cockpit.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
One unusual Suv with the original design and precisely defined determined lines, width surfaces with precise angles.
This is, in the shortcut, the lastborn Glk from the "compact" star's house, using Mercedes-Benz, trying to introduce a newspaper into this sector.
Just thanks to his non-radical processing, it will be unexpected and unconventional and communication which will provide Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the showroome Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
In this way, an advertising campaign that provides the debut of a new vehicle starts an inofficial way of communication also thanks to the future 3D platform campaign, which is the first used in Italy for car marking.
The project maxi plates, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan Trade class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
By the phase of this new type of communication, the presentation of a car in stereoscopic vision and using special brilliants that will be distributed near Corsa Como, will be possible to see a new Suv in the meaningful dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Actually, if you look at the picture, you'll have a idea that the car is going out of the plaque.
Then, by using innovation; Elumina8 will be highlighted in different moments in all its smallests, so that it will be replaced into the single image.
Mercedes is certainly trying to bring this advertising something new to the stereotypical car communication.
Will he be able to build up the interests of the future clients?
So we know who the Italian chuligians are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are those 150-200 boys and boys who are now in Italy? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been followed for years in the Azurra and who has never done any overwhelming problems yet.
She never met a fan against a man.
The direction of the group is right.
The founder comes from Trivenet.
From Verony, Padovy, Terstu and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in the ability of a few groups) were added to them from Campania and Puglie.
They have triple-color flags in which the cities of pâ participated are discovered: they removed them on Saturday evening so that they were not recognised.
They're inspired in the Ethiopian fans.
In Bulgaria, they found the right Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave access to the Italian fans 144 inputs: all for name, so easily controlled.
And Viminale checked them all: among those who were released to Sofie, there was no one with the current Dasl, no one who would be prohibited to visit stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous crimes from the stadium were rejected and prohibited.
Now Viminale expects to read messages from Bulgarian police and then to make measures: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who were arrested or to those who were identified during the distress.
The International Daspo prohibited not only to visit Italian stations but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligians, quickly, aren't going to one station.
Congratulations.
However, there is fear of emulation now: it means that more than hundred fifty are added to them.
"We have to arrest this fire right now and not justify those who do this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "very open eyes, mainly because of the national relief in the Medical Medicine."
Just in Puglia, there's a small nuclear supporter.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio, in the Casms attack, who can also count with one part of Aise, is a secret service that is just about the problems of stadiums.
"The assembly leader and pressured guard during Mameli's hymne?
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzi日 (the reality is a little swimming way) which is a few weeks of director of Viminal Osservatoria (he received a place that was previously Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi's Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzi's previous quarter in Terstu, where the nuclear of Ultras Italian supporters is found in 2002.
It's true, as Mazzi says, that in Bulgaria it's not a crime to celebrate the leader, but, of course, the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disappointment.
"I'm not a sociologist - adds the Osservator unit – crimes are attached to the country in which they were.
This group has still remained in the border, now we are looking closely at what happened and considering the future.
But let us also talk about the stars of Mommy: neither is it a crime, but if you allow, it's unrepentant..."
