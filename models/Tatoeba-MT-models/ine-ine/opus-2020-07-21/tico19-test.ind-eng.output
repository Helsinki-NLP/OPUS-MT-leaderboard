How long have these signs been spent?
And all the sockets must be handled in this way in your age.
and with silence,
and blood pressure and colesterol you also need to be tested.
And are you quiet now?
And are you feeling this snow now?
And do you have difficulties to cope?
And can you tell other signs that you are natural with this sign?
And how high is your worm?
And I'm too crazy.
And I'm a little bit and a little bit.
And I felt a heavy damage today.
And this is the alergies of rhinitis.
And the winds of the winds,
And I think I'm a little tired.
And I want you to explain your neighbor's place.
And they are silent.
and with your diabetes.
And you know, I think it's like I'm going to go.
And you know, the people always go to my right hand.
And you're feeling that you're in the neighborhood.
And you say there's a pressure in your grave.
Whoever in the family has heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Are there any signs or other problems that you care about with the snake?
Is there someone else who is sick like you at home with the same sign?
Do you feel another sign?
Did you ever feel that you’ve been aware of the truth?
Do you still feel that you’re doing so?
'Cause this is the floor's time.
But we can't be able to disappoint the hearts of the grain that comes from the heart
But the more important problem now is this snow.
And I felt the challenges of distressing
But I knew that many people were in my direction.
But we've got to handle the lady nine with very serious.
But can you be able to do good now?
I'm really lost the causes of this knife.
Does it feel like somebody stuck your knife?
I still feel like a cockpit.
Did they hurt the pain with the same sign?
Do you have a chronic problem like high blood pressure?
Do you have medical problems or other chronic diseases such as diabetes?
Do you feel that you’re in the same way?
Do you take high blood pressure?
Do you feel that the sign is in the same way?
Do you know what the story has been experienced?
Have you seen the matter?
drink a lot of hours today
But I'm running diabetes tests.
But he has a sign that is just like me.
How high is your silence?
How's your blood pressure?
if you're going to continue
if you're a hundred two or higher
if you think you're a signal or a problem you need better discussions
I'm almost yesterday
I'm also a little tired.
I'm almost yesterday
I felt a brilliant dream here, in the woods.
I also experienced the challenges.
I'm going to send a letter to you.
I'm feeling funny today.
I just felt a little head pain and hot today
According to my opinion, this is a flu
I think it's a little flu
Does it feel like someone is very hard to sit on your head?
Everyone begins from the head's pain with the winds at the hot time.
I felt sick in the middle of my card
Pressing like a white nine
on my table
in the middle of my card
in the middle of the card
I've got a noise in my head.
I'm very worried about this knife.
I want you to explain this knife.
like high blood pressure or diabetes
like right in the middle of the board
For her sore, you can drink sweet tachipirin
Mary, how many days have you experienced this sign?
You're saying you're feeling funny.
Sometimes I felt a snake.
Well, is there any other signs with this sign, except a dream?
Or someone sits on your head?
The same is the same as the silver, the throat, the head pain, and the neck of the throat.
Right in the middle of my card
Put it in this place where you feel sick
Because you're silent
So, do you think some of these signs may have been related to harm?
So, your kids have some of the same signs?
Tell me about your neighborhood
increasing in the dinner
My sister's been running for two days
Death started growing tonight
This is the Dr. Porter at the triase centre of the rock room.
Can you tell you more about your neighborhood?
I felt sorrow in front of my body, here, in the grave.
I felt the strong dream in my cart.
When I felt that dream in my cart
sorrow like what you feel in your head?
When did this knife begin?
In what part do you feel sorrow in the board?
Where's the part of you're feeling a damage?
You're feeling like a fuckin' in your head.
Do you know if I call diabetes and other diseases?
You're saying you're feeling this fucking nine.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) simulative incidence which rapidly increased in the European Union/European Economy and England, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The simulative incident of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows the same trend in the EU/Economy Economy of the European Union and the United States, which claimed that, despite its expectation of differently depending on the country, COVID-19 was very rapidly developed in all countries.
Based on Italian experiences, countries, hospitals, and intensive survey units should increase its preparation for COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the classer of pneumonia with ethology was not known in Wuhan, Province Hubei, Tiongkok.
On 9 January 2020, the Tiongkok Control and Sickness Centre reported this disease-based agent is a new coronavirus now called coronavirus accurate 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since that time, the illness of SARS-CoV-2 infection was called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence until now shows that about 80% of the COVID-19 COVID-19-residents have experienced harsh diseases, such as the infection of illness with or without pneumonia, with most of these advertisers are healthy.
In approximately 14% of the case, COVID-19 developed a heavyer disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of the other cases experience critical diseases that need intensive health.
The mortality of patients concerned in the hospital resulted in COVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we traveled COVID-19 to the EU/EEA Economy Economy (EU/EEA) and then compared it to Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
We also compare the number of cases COVID-19 at this time in EU/EA and the United States with the number of cases in Italy on 31 January-15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in EU/EA and the UK
At the Tiongkok, COVID-19 experiences a longer geografic preachment and dinamic COVID-19 pandemics in the other world when this is following pandemic dynamics in Tiongkok.
On 11 March 2020, World Health Organization Director (WHO) stated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020, issued on 5 March, Spiteri et al., the first Europeans reported with the case COVID-19 based on the definition of the WHO case.
In the EU/EA, the first three cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On 15 March 2020, cases COVID-19 were detected in all 30 EU/EA and Ingris Raya (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020, including 39.768 cases and 1.727 cases of death, with 17.750 cases and 1.441 death from Italy.
Build simulation and simulation incidence of case COVID-19
In the Centre of Europe’s Sickness and Management (ECDC), the number of cases COVID-19 announced in the world were reported at 8 p.m., only from the sources such as the National Health Committee, the National and Regional Health Authority, and the WHO.
These data were used to carry out COVID-19 trains in EU/EA and the United States, and compared them to trains in Italy.
As the prevalence of COVID-19 active case, we calculated the 14-day competitive incidence, so the COVID-19 travel in EU/EA and the United States, during the period of 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also consider the simulation of the case reported by the country until the 15th March 2020 at 8.00 p.m. compared to the case of Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Tren COVID-19 in the EU/EA and the UK
COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the United States are the 14 days of the COVID-19 case in general following trains in Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (image 1).
For EU/EA and the United States in other words, the COVID-19 competitive incidence started to increase about 21 February, and then increased the rate of approximately 28 February 2020.
This trend is mainly moved by the quick number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EA countries and the United States show the same COVID-19-Bahans.
The number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the United States shows the number of simulative cases compared to the population in Italy during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
The data suggested that until the 15th March at 8.00, 15th EU/EU and the United States have reported the total number of cases compared to the total number of cases of Italy three weeks before or less than that.
The results indicated that the number of cases of COVID-19 were reported to increase rapidly in EU/EA and the United States.
Tren watched on the COVID-19 competitive incidence assured that pandemics increased by the speed that is likely in all countries.
This is declined from the differences in national countries, the social health response variation, and the possibility of definition of cases between the country and the protocol differences to choose patients to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, which includes a source-examination.
In the beginning of March 2020, the doctors in the Italian region who claimed to explain about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive survey and media sources reported that the hospitals and intensive survey units in this area have achieved its maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case receipt data in the hospital and/or intensive survey units in EU/EAA only are available for each 6% and 1% case (not displayed data).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to collect the data of survey at this time focused on the number of cases reported and death wine.
In 2010-2011, a large variation shows that there is a great variety in the presence of intensive sleeping and mads in Europe, starting from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 1000,000 populations in Portugal.
This means that nationals can have more or less sources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive seats and age of 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
Scanarios of the most dangerous moderate of health care capacity, with the estimation of COVID-19 prevalence cases increasing for EU/EA and the United States with a risk > 90% of the capacity of intensive sleeping, are available in six rapid risk monitoring of ECDC on COVID-19.
Since this case has been classified in a specific area in the EU/EA and the United States, and the hospital and its general intensive supervisory units serve a specific regional service population, information on cases and places of intensive sleep is best available to the units of Wilayah Security for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italian experiences and trains today in other countries show that COVID-19 has developed very quickly in the EU/EA and the United States.
Therefore, the country, the hospital and the intensive survey unit should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission schedules and increase the number of COVID-19 patients that need health care, especially intensive care, as happened in Italy.
As it is sent to the recent ECDC risks, the quick, proactive, and comprehensive approach is very important to late the SARS-CoV-2 preliminary, with a derogation from the approach to the medical approach, because the fast number of cases, as it is anticipated, may not take enough time to decision-making and painful homes to understand, accept, and accept the correct response if it is not previously applied.
The rapid risk control also improves the social health steps to accept pandemic impacts.
It is available to a window of opportunity when the country has the possibility to increase its efforts to enhance the SARS-CoV-2 preliminary and to reduce the health care pressure.
If it fails, other EU/EA health care systems may face patients who need intensive survey within a few days or weeks in the future.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by coronavirus increasingly 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has soon increased more than 3.000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tiongkok and other places in the world, which cause human harm.
Mirip with its homologation virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmised from the slider and caused similar signs through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has lower degrees and mortality than SARS, but more clear and more about older than young people, and more in men than women.
As a response to the number of publications quickly increased on this new disease, this article tries to provide precise time and understanding about quickly developing research subjects.
We will consider the bases of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, advice, prognoses, and disturbances of disease.
Although we still have many questions that have not been answered, we hope that this event helps us to understand and affect this painful situation.
The Musim Semi Festival on January 25, 2020 has become a memory that has never occurred and has not been forgotten for all Tionghoa who were ordered to stay home for a few weeks afterwards because of a new virus disease.
This virus is very approved with coronavirus (CoV) that causes the syndrome of acute disabilities (SARS) in 2003; therefore, this virus was called SARS-CoV-2 by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemi started in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and quickly published the entire country and nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
By 2 March 2020, this virus has caused 80,000 COVID-19 confunded cases, with more than 40,000 patients collected and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warns that the COVID-19 is "number" and potential destroys more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.érbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), at least two months from the first report on 7 January 2020, which set the virus is isolated from some patients, more than 200 people have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and care.
This attempt is to reduce the progress of the rice in the newly developing area.
Perhaps we'll try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV diseases, as the Syndrom of the East East Disaster (MERS, in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about the disturbance and prediction of diseases and some other questions that have not yet been answered, but encouraged.
On the basis of tradition, CoV was considered non-letal patogen for humans, mostly caused about 15% of pile 4.
However, in this century, we have reached a very patogenic CoV for humans two times, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each one caused the beginning in Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabs in 2012, and immediately announced to many other countries with morbidity and mortality.
That's why COVID-19 is the third CoV in the recorded human history.
As shown in page 1.1, Pneumonia class is not known as the first time Wuhan was reported to the Commission of the National Health Republic of Tiongkok on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was destroyed.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan’s first fatal case was reported.
During that time, the epidemic was quickly divided into the city, provinces, and neighbors.
On January 20, health care infections were reported, which assured that human transmissions may occur.
On January 23, the villages were held in Wuhan and all the general campaigns were stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on this disease reported that, from 41 patients with confined cases, only 21 patients contacted directly with the Wuhan Sea market that was considered as the first place of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared that it was a global health system.
At the time of this report, this disease has been distributed to the whole Tiongkok and nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
Since the growth is quickly developed, the end and the springs must still be set.
In February 11, 2020, multiple studies of 8.866 patients, covering 4.021 COVID-19 patients, included the following epidemics (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infections people at all age, but mainly at age 30-65.
Half (47.7%) of those who are infected over 50 years, just a little less than 20 years, and only 14 infections under 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 more infections for men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is in classer, mainly inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 eats time 5 (2-9) days start from the newspaper to diagnosis.
Inkubase period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The time the rates start from the newspaper to the death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 corresponds to 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections increased exposually before June 23, 2020, according to the time of massive transport before the Muslim Semi Festival in Tiongkok.
Patient mortality was estimated by 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the mortality corresponded to all patients with 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of chlamine (man), age (≥ 60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a big virus subfamily collecting that originates the RNA sensation.
CoV can be divided into four genus, alpha, beta, §, and delta, with alpha and beta CoV is known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tonjola or spike (S) is associated with its cell receptor, angiotensine enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and peptidae 4 (DPP4) each occurred for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the fuel fuses occurred.
Genom RNA virus was released into sitoplasma; after replication through virus, genetic RNA with glucoprotein, and nucleocapsid protein constitutes a vial contained, which then experiences the fusy with plasma brake to release virus.
SARS-CoV-2 was first reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was a new CoV type with genetic equality of more than 99.98% of the following 10 models; the example was taken from the local source, the Sea Food Passer in Wuhan.
In genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By means of transmission microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particulate is found in a very typical human epithelium.
ACE2 was found as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the protein S SARS-CoV-2 is available with ACE2 humans weaker than its size with SSARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infection that is not separated from SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also consist of new proteins contained with orf3b and protein included with orf8.
Orf3b SARS-CoV-2 protein may be involved in virus patogenity and IFNb expression inhibition; but orf8 does not have a known functional or motive domain.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a Cry-EM ACE2 human holding structure at resolution 2,9 Å in complex with aluminium transporter B0AT.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformity, has been able to build dime and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can use two proteins S, which are evidence of knowledge and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be the most apetic suspension in the medical recorder to press SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Important and Mediterranean
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known from the wounds and everyone is transferred to humans through enemies and enemies.
By the SARS-CoV-2 filthy comparison with other CoVs, the slider was considered as the original SARS-CoV-2 for this new virus is 96% identical with two CoV similar-SARS from the bath-SL-CoVZX45 and the SL-CoVZX21 bath.
However, an intermediate memory that helps the virus to draw the species of infection for humans is still not known, and the transmission path must still be explained.
Ji, et al. eclipsed the cloud as a virus from the throat to the human that enhanced the homologation recombination in the S protein.
According to a study, the researcher in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, concluded that the conjunction, lamping of long honey food used often in the traditional Tionghoa medicine, potential as an intermediate SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of genetic homologation on CoV found in the calling and SARS-CoV-2.
Yet, 1% of the differences in the whole through are still a great difference; therefore, the results of concrete evidence have not yet been achieved.
SARRS-CoV-2 physicistical characteristics are not yet known.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can endure 48 hours in the warm environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have the same quality.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to ultraviolet and heat closure at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, is infected with chlorine, assessment, chloroform, and other chemicals, but not chlorhexidine, effectively deactivates virus.
Generally, all human populations have no immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and that's why it's a rent against this new virus.
Currently, there is no experimental study reporting about immunological responses against SARS-CoV-2.
That's why we can only go to another CoV study before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (see section 4).4).
Generally, after the invasion of injury, the virus is known by the immune system through the polar famous receptor (PRR), which includes C-type electin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
By different ways, the virus has enhanced the expressions of inflamator factors, dendric cell maturation, and the interferon type I (IFN) synthesis that decreases the virus prevention and accelerates the antigen fagositosis by facerofag.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help virus avoid immune response.
Soon, the adjustive immune response was associated with the fight against this virus.
Limfosit T, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays a important role in this detention.
Cell T CD4+ simulate B cells to produce a specific antibodies against virus, and T CD8+ cells killed which are directly infected with virus cells.
The T cell helps produce a proflamatorial sitokin to help protect the cell.
However, CoV can cause the T cell function by stimulating the T cell apoptosis.
Immoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also important in the fight against virus infection.
For example, the antibodies isolated from patients who have been thrown into MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overall immune reactions result in a large number of radicals free locally, which can cause disorders in the poultry and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, weak organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, signed with a newspaper classer, more about elderly diseases and pregnant women.
In general, those who have a virus in a large number or whose funeral functions have higher infections than others.
The estimation of the inkubase period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most of 3-7 days based on 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1.099 cases shows that the incubase period is 3 days and starts from 0 to 24 days.
The newer, as explained above, shows that the incubase period of 4,8 (3,0-7,2) days based on demography 8.866 cases.
It is important that health authorities determine the efficient period of karantine based on the most accurate period of incubacy so that they avoid infected, but without signs, transmit virus to others.
As a general practice, a person who has a virus or infection is usually required to carantine for 14 days.
Do you have the time of the karantine for 24 days?
Deam often is the COVID-19 main and beginning sign, with or without other signs such as the worm, the worm, the throat, the rubber, the head pain, the throat pain, the rinorea, the diarrhoea, the diarrhoea, the nausea, and the mood.
Some patients have experienced dispnea and/or hypoxemia one week after illness.
In serious cases, the development of patients’s disease is quickly to be an accurate injury syndrome, sectical sugar, metabolic asytosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who experience silentness and/or signs of disturbance and accurateness, although without throat detection, must be attached to virus for diagnosis.
Demography at the end of December 2019 shows that the percentage of 98 per cent of signs for silence, 76 per cent for warm steel, 55 per cent for dispnee, and 3 per cent for diar; 8 per cent of patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in these two recent studies, a study of the family classer and a classer that caused transmission from asimtoous people.
Similarly, the demography study in 2012 shows that the MERS-CoV patients also experienced mildness (98%), warm (47%), and dispnea (55%) as its main signal.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with more higher MERS liability than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and inflammation disease (21%) are also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, heat (99%-100%), heat (29%-75%), dysnea (40-42%), diarr (20-25%), and disturbance disease (13-25%) is placed as a main signal and ventilation support for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the COVID-19 mortality was 2% with the constructed case reached 66.576 worldwide.
Similarly, the SARS mortality in November 2002 was about 10% of 8.096 cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, the mortality of 37% of 2.494 cases were constructed.
The previous report was reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6,47 with confidence interval (CI) 95% of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in mystery, mortality, and R0 was found in Table 1.
They show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher skills than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is greater than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Avitan is often classified in one family or from one assembly or vehicle, such as fishing vessel.
Patients often have traveling or living in Wuhan or in another area or contact infection or patients in the last two weeks before the newspaper.
However, it is reported that humans can take virus without showing signs more than two weeks and patients who are born from the hospital can bring virus again, which results in an increasing karantine time.
At the beginning, the patient has a normal or severe white blood cell cell (in particular limphosite).
For example, limfopenia with white blood cell node < 4x109/L, covering the limfosite cloud < 1x109/L, and when aminotransferase aspartate and viremia increased were found in 1.099 COVID-19 patients.
When heart enzyms and myoglobins increased in blood, the number of patients, and C-reactive proteins and the level of blood increased to most of the patients.
In patients with a heavy case, when D-dimer increased, the product of fibrin in the blood, and the neck of limphosite progressively decreased.
The toracs photos were found at the large number of COVID-19 patients and signed with bilateral wheels or ground-glas opacity in the puzzle.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, accurate ceder, and accumulated appeal syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, the tactic inflames, the accumulation of the disorder, and progressive fibrosis have been adequately affected by the gas pollution.
The Pneumosit type I and the type II function increases the surface and increases the pressure in order to reduce the potential of the powder to develop and enhance the risk of the powder.
Thus, the worst finding on the toracs photos often parallels with the worst illness.
In February 18, 2020, the first analysis of COVID-19, shows the discovery of pneumocytes, determined hyalin embarrassment, and interstisial limphosite infiltration, and synthetic cells testing many in patients died because of this disease, according to virus infection and ARDS pathology, and similar to SARS and MERS patients' patology analysis.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because its high negative level, which can accelerate epidemia, the clinical manifestation started to be used for diagnosis (not more depending on RT-PCR) in Tiongkok on 13 February 2020.
The same situation also occurs in the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination between disease revisions, clinical manifestation, tests, and radiological findings is very important and the need to make effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the group Feng Zhang explained the CRISPR-based SHEROCK technology protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected the RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic at 20 × 10-18 mol/L up to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter per input) using the cell sum for less than one hour without needing a reimbursed instrument.
Maybe this new technology can increase the sensitivity and the potential if it is checked in clinical examples.
Because I'm decreasing the experience with the new CoV, the primary doctor offers support for COVID-19 patients, trying to use a variety of therapies that have been used or previously for other CoV surveys, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other virus diseases (Table 2).
This treaty includes therapy currently and potential therapy with antivirus, immunosuppression, steroid, plasma of patients who have already cured, traditional Tionghoa medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who have already been cured is designed to be used in therapy.
The pharmaceutical company runs to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 was mostly attacked by the park and may also attack other organs expressing ACE2 in a lower range, such as gastrointestinal and geneal system.
However, the disasters and losses are a major threat to patients and the causes of death.
Therefore, the support of pollution is very important to reject signs and save life, which includes general oxygen oxygen, high oxygen oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the rate of illness.
Patients with heavy disorders should be supported by oxygenation of extracorporeum brain (ECMO), such as the cardiopulmoner’s modified cardiopulmoner technology used for cardiac failure or injury that affects the soul.
Furthermore, electromagnetic developments, deficiencies, and sectical infection protection, and vital organ functions are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The more known immune system reactions cause the sitokin body to SARS and MERS patients.
The Sitokins are the form of the systemic inflamator response that is indicated for the debt of the sitokins, which includes TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNB, IFNb, IFNg, and MCP-1.
These Sitokin-sitokins induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that become the principal cause of ARDS and failure of a major organ.
Immunosupression is very important in the attack of the sitokins, especially on the patients.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, the specific monochloric antibodies anti-IL6 have been used to handle the sitokin body.
Another immunosuppressive intervention for the sitokin body includes the modulation of the immune response set by cell T; IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; JAK-inhibition; blinatumomab; the signature of Sitokin 4; and HDAC-inhibitor.
Steroid, as immunosuppression, was used in the SARS warrant to reduce the inflamator disorders.
However, steroids at high doses are not used for heavy powder in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, the steroid can cause the heavy effect, especially osteonecrosis, which affects prognoses.
However, the corticosteroidal corticosteroid at the low dosis is intended to be given with care to COVID-19 patients who are critical.
In this case, there was no effective antivirus terapie that has been constructed.
However, the remdesivir structure intravenously, as a nuclear analogue, was accessed to a COVID-19 patients in America.
Desivir is a new antivirus medicine developed by Gilead, first for the diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg.
Later, remdesivir also shows an inhibition against RNA virus, which includes MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead provided that this is for Tiongkok in order to test the tests of SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the results were very expected.
Moreover, baricitinb, interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential treatment for patients with acute disorders.
Diare, nausea, disorder, heart disorders, and other reactions may occur after therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This treatment interaction with other medicines used by patients must be directed closely.
Plasma of patients who have been cured and antibodies
There is a long story of the blood collection of patients who have been healed from the diseases that have been cured to treat other patients who urge the same disease or to avoid health career.
Of course, patients who have been healed often have relatively high antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (I) which produced limfosis B to combat patogens and other aliens, recognizing the unique molecule on patogens, and directly retracing it.
Based on this, the plasma is collected from the blood of patients who have been healed from COVID-19 and are subjected to 10 painful patients.
In 24 hours, their signals were covered by inflammation and virus bottles and increased oxygen saturation in blood.
However, checking and clarification needs to be added to the method for the use of a large scale before specific therapy is developed.
Moreover, other than the apothetic effects, some plasma minorities need to be meditated closely.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immune response increasingly and cause the sytokine relief syndrome, which is toxicity that is potential to anxiety.
The antibodies concentration in blood are usually low and plasma needed in a large number to care for a critical disease.
The development and production of specific antibodies are quick enough to combat global difficult epidemies in the EEC.
Therefore, more important and practical isolation of B cells than patients who have already cured and identify genetic codes that lead to effective antibodies or make effective antibodies records against the important protein for virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiongkok for thousands of years.
However, the majority of its effects depend on the combination of various components in the formula, which differently depends on the TCM theory diagnosis.
Most of the effective components are still not known or not clear because it is difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Now, because there is no efficient and specific treatment for COVID-19 yet, the TCM has become one of the main alternative therapy for patients with a low signal until it is or for a person who is quiet from heavy disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du Capsul and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were honoured for COVID-19.
COVID-19 patients are observed in some Tiongkok provinces using TCM in 87% of its patients, which include Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which only uses TCM at about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has a limited level (13%).
However, this comparison is still very small because many other factors, such as the number of patients, must be given in assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends republiced a study that compares western drug therapy (WM) only with WM and TCM terapies.
They discovered that the time needed for the recycling of the body was lost, and the wind was far more severe than WM+TCM.
More exciting, the range of WM+TCM signs is far less than WM+TCM (7,4% rather than 46,2%) and the decreased mortality is less than WM+TCM only (8,8% as 39%).
However, TCM efficiency and security are still waiting for a better test test at the larger scale and in more research centres.
Another interesting thing is to identify work mechanism and clarify effective components in TCM or its combination, if possible.
Most of the patients who have been able or convergenced in COVID-19 feel very scared of a very painful disease and even with this, and those who are cared are also feeling worse, singleness, and anger.
Moreover, signs of infection such as delicateness, hypoglycaemia, and thrombocytical effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
At the beginning phase of the SARS, the depression of psychiatric morbidity, which includes depression, anxiety, panic attack, psychomotors, psychological signs, delirium, and even suicide, has been reported.
Reviews of contacts and karantines, as part of social health response to COVID-19, can make people more worry and feel the harmful effects of the invasion, karantine, and stigma of friends and friends.
That is why mental health care must be provided for COVID-19 patients, the patients, and those who contact them, and the public society that needs.
Psychological support must include a multidisciplinary mental health team, a clear communication with a routine and accurate statement on SARS-CoV-2, and the treatment plans and the use of professional electronic applications to avoid contacts close to each other.
Effective vaccine is very important to change the transmission of animal reserve and human infections to rental and often prevent antiviral therapy in control of epidemies caused by virus adjudication.
Empaya has been able to develop a based protein S vaccine, which makes a long and effective antibodies and/or immunity protected against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, life-related vaccine has been evaluated in test animals.
However, the efficiency of this vaccine in vivo candidate at age and model of deficiency and protection against zoonotic virus infections must still be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because the SARS was 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since that time.
Instead, the Sporadis and the MERS classter continue to occur in the East East and spread to other regions because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic area.
Vaxination has been developed for MERS using unactive virus, DNA plasma, virus vector, nanoparticles, particulates like virus, and rekombination protein subunits and parts have been devaluated in test animals.
The development of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 which is safe and effective for non-immunity is a very urgent and important task to control epidemics that are running.
However, this difficulty is not easy because long time to develop vaccine (a degree of 18 months) and dynamic CoV variation.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just started showing its full clinical trip to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can start health without any of them.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also pained with a high morbidity and mortality in patients with hard cases.
Thus, it is important for the health care body to prioritize its ministry, especially in the area with limited sources.
Based on clinical studies reported long, the following factor can affect or be pained with COVID-19 (Table 3) predicts:
Usia: Usia was the most important factor for the SARS prognoses, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 first occurred at age 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 years in the study of 8.866 cases as explained above.
Patients that need intensive intensity are having a competitive comorbidity and complication and more significantly older than patients who do not need intensive insurance (including 66 years of age compared to 51), which provides age as a prognosy factor for the result of COVID-19 patients.
SARRS-CoV-2 is more infected by men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Comorbidity and complication: COVID-19 patients who need intensive advice have a greater probability of experienced accurate and aritmical hearts.
The experience of the heart also enjoys the primary cause of death in the SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported can be accessed with cologiosite with ACE2-effektivs, which can cause the disfunction of heart in COVID-19 patients.
Age and sickness are very corelated and can affect one another.
Abnormal fuzzy: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the inflammation or network ceder and is produced as potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final return.
Correlation between the CRP and the CRP levels and the COVID-19 prognoses has also been proposed.
Furthermore, dehydrogenase lactation (≤H), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and cinema creatin (CK) can also help to predict the final results.
These enzymes are very high in various organs, especially in hearts and hearts, and are released during network disorders.
That's why these enzymes are traditional enzymes to work out the heart and heart.
Main clinical signal: Photo toracs and temporary clinical history development must be considered together with other things to predict the end and complication of COVID-19.
steroid use: As explained above, the steroid is an immunosuppression that many use as an infection disease to reduce inflamator disorders.
Since high-dosis shortikosteroids are used in SARS patients, many who have been rescued from this disease finally urged avascular osteonecrosis with the ability of life and a bad quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids must be used at low dose and time limits for COVID-19 patients.
Psychological pressure: As explained above, during COVID-19, many patients urge extraordinary stress because they have to carantine long and extreme insufficiency and deteriorate the death of nearby family members and neighbors.
Psychology and long support must be given to help this patient from stress and return to normal life.
Based on this long demography study, COVID-19 seems to have epidemiological ideas different to SARS.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively implemented in the surface and cause a raw or without a sign at the beginning phase of infection, like another CoV that causes pills.
Therefore, at the beginning phase or incubacy time, infected patients can result in a large number of viruses during daily activity, which caused big challenges to control epidemic control.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission was believed when the patient was infirm and most of them did not happen at the beginning phase.
Thus, COVID-19 is now far more hard and hard to be controlled than the SARS.
Today, great efforts are in Tiongkok, which includes the Wuhan areas and cities around and carantines are surprised by the whole population with the hope of changed SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this action is very devastated by the economic and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients are increasing the epidemic deterioration.
The most optimistic evaluation states that the winds will end in March and the spring phase for 3-4 months.
Yet, some of the other leaders do not understood that.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be far more lower than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., has made a model to predict the result of the end of the epidemic and states that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two parts of the global population.
Canadian investigator group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the middle-conca and washing patients who had been healed and returned from the hospital 2 weeks ago. This indicates that the virus that was identified again could be repeated episode, like the influenza.
Yet, the promised signs occur in Tiongkok, if it seems to be based on it a number of new cases, which show that the strategy may be successful at this time.
Ebola’s first preacher would cause a million cases to cause death.
However, with karantine and severe isolation, this disease can finally be controlled.
Maybe also, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is able to infection and finally disappear or become a virus is not too patogen that can feed with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS epidemies is below (see paragraph 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmised through a bullet or a cup, and may also through a direct contact with a confusion of virus.
This virus was also found in the festivals so that it represented the possibility of new transmission, the transmission of the feses-process.
These recently in 138 cases reported that 41% of the case may be caused by noocomial infection, which includes 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health careers.
In order to protect humans, especially health careers, social workers, family members, fellow workers, and even those who are rightly contacted with patients or infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is using the face mask, well-deep mask and N95 respirator mask (number 1860) help control virus preliminary.
The masker is watching that people who are infectionate may not follow the air or stick to the winds, where they can continue to be put to others.
However, only N95 masker (number of 1860s) that can protect the inhalation of virion with approximately 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virion can completely control it; SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV in the case of size, both are about 85 nm.
Since particulates can control even five wallet maskers that became one, the health career directly contacted with patients must use N95 (number of the 1860s) and not a low mask.
Besides the masker, health career must use a paused isolation clothes to reduce the contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, an infectionate SARS-CoV-2 doctor, although he used N95 mask; the virus may be entered into its body through the eye adjustment.
Therefore, health career should also take a look at the faces of the faces of the sights or of the illness of the patient.
For public society in the areas that are attracted or potential, it is very recommended for people to cut off their hands with illness of illness, trying to stay in the house for karantine, and avoid contact with those who are infected.
Three feet roads were cut in order to keep the patient’s back.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent virus preliminary.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was a new virus for the human world, its higher approval with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, it must be a great warning for Tiongkok which had a strong memory of the SARS in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, director of the Wuhan Sickness Control Centre dealed with the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality of preaching and the ability of reproduction from humans to humans and disturbance, and that disease is not a problem.
This is a great challenge for social fear, especially when the whole country is preparing the Musim Semi Festival, so this critical time has passed to build a small illness in Wuhan.
Thongkok’s illness control should be labeled in this study and make a big test in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public information because the people have been advised and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reacting to non-limited information than waiting for a clinical report from a doctor or an employee; (3) more detailed in order to maintain the potential of epidemic at the beginning, not to try to overcome the public; and (4) more frequently enhance public training and efficiency to increase public science on disease epidemies and testing and enhance public response systems periodically.
COVID-19 was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to hit at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the winds have been published to the whole Tiongkok and more than 50 countries in the world during this publication.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the COVID-19 signs and SARS also, COVID-19 members are renewed.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to build epidemics and to handle patients.
COVID-19 more about older than young people and more about men than women, and more dead levels are also higher than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients have transmitted virus even though they are without signs, while the SARS patients are usually transmitting virus when they are sick. This makes greater difficulties in constructing the COVID-19 preacher than SARS.
This explains some reasons for SARS-CoV-2 to divide faster and more than SARS-CoV.
Associate RNA routine to investigate SARS-CoV-2 can meet negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured may have a positive result of virus discrimination.
This finding has increased the risk of the virus preacher.
With so quickly the progress of the COVID-19 investigation, some important problems must still be resolved, so:
Where's SARS-CoV-2 coming from?
Although a genetic homologation was found about 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoV likeip-SARS, we can still not conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the floor.
What animals have become the species of the intermediate for the virus of the original wheat, tell the human?
Without a knowledge of the answers numbers 1 and 2, we can't change the transmission with effectiveness and we can turn back to the time.
Although molecular and biochemical models show that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how exactly is the input virus to the low cell and causes the following pathology change?
Is this virus also available with cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot reach quick and accurate diagnosis and effective advice.
How long will this epidemic go?
How did the virus develop genetically during the transmission of humans?
Will this pandemy become a pandemic worldwide, end like SARRS, or again periodically like a flu?
An answer to questions above and many other statements is very important, but it may need time to find it.
Yet, whatever we appreciate, we have no other choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible to get back to normal life.
Zonotic human coronal virus
During thousands of years, mutation and adaptation have moved the co-evolution of corona virus (CoV) and its winter, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were known to cause disorder diseases, such as sequences.
The heavy acute infection syndrome (SARS) and the East East Infection Syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and explains how HCoV infections can be extremely destroyed and harmful.
His SARRS-CoV-2 in the center of Tiongkok at the end of 2019 has made CoV re-sockets and encountered us with high transmission, but with lower patogenity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis, therefore, the HCoV zoonotic understanding will benefit us.
Most of the HCoVs come from the disorder. In this animal, the virus is not patogenic.
A number of HCoV reservations has also been known.
The specifying animals have direct implications in human diseases.
Research of CoV interactions in animals can also give significant differences on the CoV patterns to humans.
In these events, we have understood the general knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on his discovery history and its zoonotic sources and the transmission of its anti-especies.
The important thing, we compared and signed the HCoV from the view of evolution and recombination through.
Epidemi of CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently located in this context.
Furthermore, the provisions of investment and the influence of virus evolution in diseases are also absorbed.
Corona virus (CoV) originated from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of the RNA virus cells, positive instructions, and happiness.
This virus has the biggest trip of 26 to 32 kilobase between the RNA virus called CoV, because its morphology is similar to the rock under the electron microscope.
On the basis of its structure, CoV has a non-segmentated genom that has similar obedience.
About two thirds are one of two largely open-readed (ORF1a and ORF1b) parts of each other. Both are translated to pp1a and pp1ab replication polyprotein.
Polyprotein has experienced further inflammation to constitute 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of it is set out from the ORF for structural proteins, covering tonjolan or spike (S), rubber or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of proteins specific to the line of certain generations are also commanded by various CoV generations.
On the basis of the differences on proteins, CoV was classified to four genus (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, ↑-CoV and delta-CoV); among those four types, the best types of coVs have the best HCoV and were split to four generations (A, B, C and D).
The physiological evidence shows that the catastrophics and animals are the sources of gene alfa-CoV and beta-CoV, while they are the main reserve of CoV and delta-CoV.
During the thousands of years, CoV continued to currency the species and some CoV have become a human important pattern.
To this time, there are seven human CoVs (HCoV) known.
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alfa-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs follow HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronal syndrome acute disorder (SARS-CoV), coronal syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 are usually caused by a low signal, such as pills and/or diars.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are very patogenic, causes heavy infections on relatively more patients and has higher benefits to develop acute disturbance syndrome (ARDS) and manifestation outside the parus organs.
Strain HCoV-229E first, B814, was isolated from the healthy patients in the middle of the 1960s.
Since that time, more knowledge has been collected through a close study against HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both caused their own healthy signals.
Even so, this concept has been accepted increasingly that HCoV infection is generally not dangerous until the SARS has occurred.
The SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastated areas in the history of this day, which infected more than 8.000 people with deceased death wine about 10%.
Ten years later, the Sindrome of the East East Disaster (MERS) caused an amazing epidemic in Arabic Conference with sporatic preaching to a variety of other parts of the world.
HCoV new 2019 (2019-nCoV), whose next name is SARS-CoV-2, is the cussatitive epidemic of coronary 2019 (COVID-19), which has enhanced life more than 3.120 people and infected more than 91.000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been hidden, and the world has to prepare himself for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemy that will come.
The seven HCoVs have all the zoonotic sources of bullets, tissues, or animals of survival.
Many evidence supports the source of all the HCoVs of the rocks. In the spring, CoV is acting well and unpatogenic, but shows great genetics.
Epidemi COVID-19 has caused medical, scientific, social, and extreme moral challenges for Tiongkok and the whole world.
The HCoV zoonotic sources include the absence of work to understand nature, movement, and the factor of the fact that the movement between species has occurred.
This can also lead or fascinate the search of reservative animals, mediators and SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in preaching preventions in the future.
In this event, we gave the general instructions of the zoonotic source, the transmission of anti-species, and even the HCoV.
We especially suggested and discussed the general subject that the HCoV virus is usually a non-patogenic characteristic in its natural reservation, but become patogenic after transmission of antarctics to new winter.
We also review the HCoV evolution trend that transmission potential is often associated with patogenism.
The results of the end of SARS-CoV-2 epidemie are also included in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E isolation B814 first of the successful patients, several CoVs have been isolated from various infected animals, which include calculators, tissues, rubbers, cats, and dogs.
In a few last reports, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The history of HCoV findings in the cronological order (Tabel 1) is an informative design.
Strain HCoV-229E first was isolated from the patients' inflammation that experienced the surface infection in 1966, which was adjusted to grow in the WI-38-line.
HCoV-229E infectioned patients show a severe signal, which covers head pain, shine, bottle, and inflammation pain, together with tissue and stomach shown at 10~20% of the case.
The following in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organic culture and a series of roads sent to the white brain that remains awake.
HCoV-OC43 infection clinical infection seems similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be simultaneously compared to the infection of other inflammation patogen infections such as influenza A and rhinovirus virus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are split throughout the world and the most highest streams are transmitted during the cold hour in the area.
Of course, this two viruss are less than one week and are followed with a painful time for about two weeks.
On the basis of a voluntary human study, healthy people infected HCoV-229E experienced a lot of calamity.
Only a few patients with a system of disorders of the body that shows the infections of a weighty seal.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first HCoV consequences documented well in human history and its ethological agent SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first case of the SARS can be retrieved to the end of 2002 in the Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
The SARS epidemy caused 8 096 cases to be reported with 774 deaths, in many countries and lands.
Despite the super explosive, the case was considered can cause about two secondary cases, with 4-7-day incubation and seven-day virus seen on the 10-day disease.
The patients who were infected with SARS-CoV first experienced mixture, head-small, hot pain, wheel, and throat, followed by dispnea, stone, and the insults as a sign of the following.
Limfopenia, unusual heart function tests, and cinema creature is a lazyme poetry in SARS.
Alveolary disorders, epithelic proliferation, and an injury are also observed in the SARS patients.
Next, approximately 20-30% of patients need intensive monitoring and mechanical ventilation.
Furthermore, some organs that cover gastrointestinal, heart, and geneal can also be infected in difficult cases, usually with the sitokinic body, which can be called, especially in patients who are weak.
The virus was first isolated from the puzzle biopsy opened a zero patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since that time, an effort has been dedicated to HCoV studies.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from age 7 months from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus first was very disappointed by the child, the elderly, and the weak patient who urged the disease of the infection.
The core, conjunctitis, decoration, and bronchiolitis lazim was affected by HCoV-NL63 diseases.
Others explain the same virus isolation from the species of the children's earlier eight months that call pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually in the world.
It was thought that HCoV-NL63 was about 4.7% of general disorder diseases and its events occurred at the beginning of the warm, the honey, and the cold season.
HCoV-NL63 is threatened with obstructive laringitis, which is also called crawl.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had ever been concerned for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the pneumonia and bronchiolitis community, HCoV-HKU1 was reported with exacerbation of accurate asme.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 were found worldwide, caused the disease of heat.
These four HCoV communities have been adapted to humans and generally have small potential of mutation to a very patogen disease. However, an extraordinary case has occurred because of unknown reasons, such as in the HCoV-NL63 subtype case, which recently reported to cause the heat infection in the Tiongkok.
In general, when it is able to move effectively and continue to be maintained in humans, the virulence and the patogenity of the HCoV also decreased.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old patients who experienced acute pneumonia and failure in Saudi Arabia.
Though most of the cases were confined from the East East, the cases of imports were reported in a number of European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary point occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases constructed.
MERS clinical manipulation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which says with pneumonia progressive acute.
Not like SARS, many MERS patients have also experienced a deficiency of acute geneal, which has only occurred to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show the gastrointestinal signs, such as a diarrhoea and awake.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases were reported with high case death, which is 34.4 per cent, made MERS-CoV the most terrible virus known by humans.
In the middle to the end of December 2019, the classer of pneumonia patients who were retrospectively threatened with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the infection of the underlying infections that are running and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Duration and called that disease COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases have been constructed throughout the world, with a deceitful case of 3,4%.
The case of death in Hubei, Tiongkok, about 4,2 per cent, while the death of the case outside Hubei is about 1,2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with silent, steam, and increasing.
Diare was also attended in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the heavyest signs and can quickly develop to the accurate syndrome of accurate disturbance.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar to the high nucleotic urutic homologation, as well as 82%, both moved into a different philetics tree.
SARS-CoV-2 patogonism clearly below, but more than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported without signs and may be involved in the SARS-CoV-2 presentation quickly throughout the world.
Comparing and distinguing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting comparisons and differences.
First, HCoV’s incubacy and long-term travel is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general train of six other HCoV.
Second, the COVID-19 communities are included between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On one side, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows the most common infection of the Community HCoV infection, which includes non-ecological signals or even without signs.
On the other hand, a small part of COVID-19 cases can seem to look like SARS-CoV infection, although a little lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows an interesting role characteristics, has an opportunity with the HCoV community and SARS-CoV.
On one side, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity at least equal to HCoV community.
On the other hand, it is not the ability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after some travels on humans still needed to be verified, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, the same as the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the fees model.
"Is the SARS-CoV-2 transmission important, such as in the SARS-CoV transmission case, at least on a certain level, that must be declared by the next study?"
What is very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is a musical quality such as the HCoV community case.
Anyway, the SARS-CoV-2, which includes the potential of transmission, patogenity, and the preaching work in some ways on humans, will be very influenced on the end of the COVID-19s that is going on.
Four HCoV communities that cause the raw signs have been adapted to humans.
Seeing from another point of view, humans have been adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, well, HCoV and humans may be the species of the HCoV Punctuation.
HCoV, which causes heavy diseases to humans and humans who experience heavy HCoV disease, has lost.
In order to happen this, HCoV must be implemented in humans in a number that can be enabled to stimulate adaptive mutations in order to combat monetary deficiency factors.
Thus, as long as the SARS-CoV-2 has endured and increased infection, the greater probability of this virus is adapted to humans.
If the virus is well adapted, the transmission to humans would be difficult to stop carantine or other steps in the infection.
For years, four CoV communities were in the population of humans and had a lot of people who were immunocompetitive.
This virus doesn't need animal reservation.
Instead, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV who are very patogenic have not been adapted to humans and transmissions in humans can't be protected.
The two need to keep themselves and make it in the zoonotic reservation and seek the opportunity to share in the interested human goals, possibly through one or a few of the international funds and the amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a comparison with SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmised. It's like HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more patogenic than HCoV community and not SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It must be noted whether SARS-CoV-2 will be fully adapted to humans and circulated in humans without reserve or intermediate animals.
Before discussing the HCoV animal origin, we need to consider the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservation, intermediate, and the extension of HCoV.
Animals are acting as a HCoV evolutionary monster if they have a nearly-fishing hot and shared higher homologation in the nucleotide level.
The virus is usually adapted with goodness and unpatogenic qualities in this heart.
Similarly, the reserve has brought HCoV in a long time memory.
In these two cases, infections are naturally infected and are natural intelligence for HCoV or induced virus.
Instead, if the HCoV newly entered the middle inside right before or about the time of the virus to humans, the virus is still not adapted with new money and often patogenic.
This intermediate investment can be functioned as a source of human infection and play as an improving inflammation by allowing viruss to be temporarily implemented, then transmitting it to humans to enhance human infection scales.
HCoV can experience specific infections if it cannot maintain its transmission in the internal memory.
Instead, HCoV can also be adapted with intermediate money and even caused the long-term endemic.
In this case, the memory of the community becomes the memory of natural reserves.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that the SARS case has no contacts with animals.
The following seroprevalence studies indicate that animal sales have higher IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence than general population.
The moon (Paguma larvata) and the birds in the live animal market are the first time it was identified with the virus similar to SARRS-CoV, which is similar to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that there is no case of SARS reported since all the enemies in the market were killed.
Instead, it was reported that a monthly enemy from the natural or non-subscribed animals is a major part of the results of the negative tests for SARS-CoV. This suggests that the month's enemy may only act as an intermediate amplification, but not a natural SARS-CoV resort.
It is necessary to note, since 80 per cent of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it is not possible to conclude that many small species of animals are also functioning as a SARS-CoV amplification rate.
All this winter seems to be the end of SARS-CoV.
The search of natural animals for SARS-CoV continues to reveal CoV a closely-free cove, named CoV, the Rhinolopus-SarRS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is located on the tiongkok horse throat.
This carrier members the positive test for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and follow-up through SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This CoV and the CoV are part of the approval of the nucleotide 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This is a foundation for the new concept that the destruction is the money for new human patogens.
Some CoV similar to SARRS (SL-CoV) are also identified from the wallet, but only one, which is called WIV1, can be isolated as living virus.
Angiotensin change enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 originating in a fashion feses model is shown by using ACE2 insults, enemies, and humans as receptor to enter the cell.
What's interesting, a series of SARS convalesenes can influence WIV
Since this time, WIV1 has enhanced the most closely associated with the SARS-CoV in the wallet, with a type of nucleotide according to 95%.
Despite its higher homologation between these two viruses, it was generally believed that WIV1 was not directly induced by SARS-CoV and the wallet is not in the SARS-CoV reserve.
Philetic analysis enlarged MERS-CoV into the same lamp as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 screen and MERS-CoV use the same receptor, as peptidae 4 (DPP4), as a virus road.
The RNA polymerase depends on the MERS-CoV RNA in filthy closer to its advice in the CoV beta, which was identified by Europe and Africa.
Until this time, there's no MERS-CoV lives found in a bullet.
MERS-CoV and its nearby friend CoV-HKU25 was only shared by 87% of the nucleotide homologation.
That's why the cluster may not have a direct reservation of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the East East show that the Arabia members have serial results for specific antibodies that represent MERS-CoV, the same source of the East East source in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from the Arabic pools. This is increasing more than that the depth is the real reserve for MERS-CoV.
The important thing was also observed is that the massive virus inflammation with a signal that usually is lowly observed in the tests that are infected with MERS-CoV.
It is necessary to note, the infectioned pockets lost the virus not only through the inflammation path, but also through the fecal-oral paths, which are also the main path of the virus inflammation from the throat.
However, the issues are still not answered because many MERS cases are constructed have no contact revision before the signal advertising, probably the cause of human transmission or non-known transmission paths that include unknown animal species that bring MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 divides 96.2% of nucleotide nuclear homologation with CoV raTG13 is isolated from Rhinolophus affinis.
Like in cases SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to set an induced relationship.
In other words, the cluster may not have a direct reserve of SARS-CoV-2, except if CoV is found in the last day.
Probably, the animals of the SARS-CoV-2 are among the species of sale and murdered in the Grossir Sea Food Pass. Many first cases of COVID-19 are scared with this market, which reduce the possibility of the transmission of animals.
Some recent studies based on the metagenological sequence indicate that a small-scale-scale-scale, known as trenggling (javanica Manis), may also be brought to a cov-coV-related beta-coV-related with SARS-CoV-2.
This new CoV training genom divides 85-92% of nuclear-cov-approval homologation with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV was close to RaTG13 with a comparison of 90 per cent at the nucleotide level.
The two were moved into two subgars of virus like SARS-CoV-2 in the philetic tree, one part of the receptor (RBD) domain which is more like SARS-CoV-2, with a comparison of amino as 97.4%.
Included things, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are far more different, although the total type of approval is overall through higher.
Previously, in the painful trends also reported the contingent virus detection from a parue, which also appeared to be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This adjusts a different method of dilution and it seems manually to produce a consequence of parsial consisting of approximately 86.3% by the virus.
We can't conceive the potential of trending as one of the animals of the SARS-CoV-2.
However, there were no evidence that supported SARS-CoV-2 directly from training because the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-saRS-CoV-2 was called.
Furthermore, the range between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is closer to the range between SARS-CoV-2 and the CoV beta-SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary travel in the ship, training, and other households still need to be set.
Although the highest high-relevant homologation of the RBD is found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV partner-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shares the highest type-approvals in the total by means.
It is too speculated if it is said that it's a high range of the risk between the RBD beta-CoV-related SARRS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 was moved by the convergence evolution which was transmitted by its selective activity.
The hypothesis of the reference supports the recombination between the beta-CoV beta-SARS-CoV-2 trenggling and RaTG13 in the third animal species.
As a factor of evolution movement, the recombination of many occurs between the CoV beta.
The investigators are still not able to decide about the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic source.
Besides a very patogenic HCoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The physiological evidence reduces that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be from covs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 has been found in the primary animals.
It was reported that CoV is an ARCoV.2 (Applahlahian Ri® CoV), detected in three northern America's three colors, shows vital violence close to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was geneticly associated with the other covs, with the name of Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, and Camelidae was also known as its intermediate memory.
In order to clearly clarify, the current knowledge of the source of HCoV animals recorded at 1 and Table 2.
File Analysis has given evidence of the transmission of HCoV anti-species in history.
In approximately 1890, when HCoV-OC43 was drawn up species of animals to infect humans, it was noted that there was a head of infection.
The HCoV-229E transmission history is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV-related HCoV-229E has been found.
Among the two, there's alpha-CoV alpha.
Some evidence supports the direct transmission of virus from humans.
First, humans, not alms, may have been contacted with the ecological dilution together.
Instead, humans have a close contact with alpha.
Secondly, the alfa-CoV-related hepatitis with HCoV-229E is a species and non-patogenic in the disorders, while the alpha-CoV-alpha causes infection diseases in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV alpha was not found in feral animals.
That's why the alpha may be obtained by the HCoV-229E of humans.
It was also a source of human patogenic virus, which covered rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
That is why it is not too surprising that the throat may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another probability, while alfa-CoV is functioning as a gene HCoV-229E lung, the alpha and the Arabians may be functioned as an intermediate investment that transmits virus to humans, exactly as the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV was a very good example for the transmission of antarctics from the treasure to the Arabic village and from the Arabic pool to humans.
The source of the MERS-CoV evolutioner from the screen is known at the beginning of the virus identification and is also strengthened by finding after them.
Clearly, the bullet is a rich virus species for genetic antarps and the transmission of antarspetition.
The long world, the colonies, the collars, the old social interaction, and the strongest potential, all are the conditions supported for the victim to become the ideal virus preliminary.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arabic village for decades.
This virus has been adapted to the ships that have changed from the crowds to a stabil and natural reserve.
MERS-CoV causes a very heavy disease and maintains relatively low mutations in this animal.
Its sporatic transmission to humans occurred in a proper manner and humans remained the end of MERS-CoV because its transmission couldn't be surprised.
Not as the part of the MERS-CoV transmission, the training role, if there is, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In the first place, the CoV beta trengerly is very patogenic in training.
The turning may be the end of the covs for the SARS-CoV-2 friends, like an enemy in the case of SARS-CoV.
In the studies comes, some probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 transmission of animals to humans should be calculated or charged.
First, the cluster could be a reserve for SARS-CoV-2 friendly virus that is identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can divide ecological reliefs with a wound through a new rock or a new rock.
Second, training can be one of the intermediate amplification memories for the new SARS-CoV-2-friendly virus.
Humans have virus through birds and consumption.
Maybe a lot of males, which cover the animals, a rent against SARS-CoV-2.
An antibodies survey against animals of survival and animals needed to be.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third kind that is well contacted with the wallet and the train.
The SARS-CoV-2 sources are still running.
Despite various species of animals, three major factors of the virus side also are important to determine CoVs to reduce the species.
First, his relatively high mutation in the RNA replication.
In comparison with other successful RNA viruses, CoV mutation thoughts can be considered "shopping" to "height" with the total degrees of ~10-4 per year per year, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to new walls.
CoV has exoribonuclease recreation, elimination that causes very high mutability, atenuation, or even invisible.
Interestingly, the analogic nucleoticide is known to press CoV replication through the inhibition of this exorbunuclease and the RNA polymerase.
Desivir is one of the most promised anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
However, the CoV mutation is about a hundred times higher than its wine mutation.
Moreover, the mutation is often high when CoV has not been adapted with money.
In comparison with SARS-CoV with high mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, the amount of higher adaptation with humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has been adapted to another cup that is close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also happens to MERS-CoV that has been adapted to the Arabians.
Theoretically, small probably that genetics will quickly make vaccine and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, through the large RNA in CoV, the additional flexibility in the modifying through, for mutation and recombination increased the probability of the co-evolution of the anti-evolutional species, which allows it to appear newly in the appropriate conditions.
This is supported by many of the unified reading and protein functions that are spread to the end of 3′ genom.
Third, CoV was able to put a straight straight during the RNA replication through the unique "elect-salin" mechanism.
In the money that works as a covering body, the challenge of the RNA CoV transcription occurs.
RNA very homologated and subgenomic RNA can experience recombination to establish a new CoV.
Natural philosophics have been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in CoV animals such as SL-CoV and CoV-HKU9.
Interactions with virus-in-the-the-case with transmission
Furthermore, three virus factors mentioned above, the virus interaction with receptor is another major factor that affects the transmission of anti-species.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered as a language example, which also shows positive selection evidence during the transmission of antarctics.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolation and enemy, SARS-CoV was expected to have rapid adjustment in various money, especially with mutation on RBD protein S.
Generally, the RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptor and intensively become the target of an antibodies.
In the SARS-CoV, RBD is the aminosium from 318 to 510 in the S1 Fragm, which is associated with ACE2 humans and its coreseptors as the inside of the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptor of various animals, which cover the vibrators, enemies, tissues, and food dogs, so that it allows the transmission of antraspective virus.
In fact, only 6 amino residues that were observed differently between the human virus isolation and the enemy in the RBD and 4 are placed in the receptor's motif for interaction with ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV hosts have K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the interaction of the protein interaction with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino substitutions may be very important for the adjustment of virus to humans.
It must be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S involves the affinity of protein S with ACE2 humans may have changed.
A Cryo-EM study also shows the affinity of human ACE2 and protein S SARS-CoV-2 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV protein.
It is also important to know if there are other correctors that may be needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
What's interesting, HCoV-NL63 also shared with ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidese N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-terasetilation agents for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also be involved in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after transmission of antagonists from its animal wheat.
In addition to the cell receptor, the result of the end of HCoV transmission of antarctics is also arranged by the factor of the extent and the other inheritance.
The differences between humans and natural reserve, such as arabians, and animals can be the right to transmission of antarctics.
HCoV has to take a decline of money dependencies and boolean insurance factors in order to succeed in the transmission of anti-species.
In this case, the molecular specification in the interaction of these important viruses must still be identified and said.
The whole recorder is unusual to see the SARS-CoV-2 memory factors using the CRISPR used may be beneficial.
New HCoV: back to the beginning
CoV's covered a big debt to show her new HCoV.
In this case, CoV was running as a HCoV-gene palmsheet.
Moreover, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also moved HCoV evolution and worked as two important steps in this process.
For example, the deterioration or loss of new proteins are potentially drasticly modifying the virus fenotipe.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was worth important in adaptation to humans because the SARS-CoV virus was found isolated by ORF8.
SARS-CoV with 29 nuclear elimination rate was found in a stranger isolated at the beginning of human epidemic.
This solution separates ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be adaptive mutation that supports investment.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV may have a re-combination history with the line of alfa-CoV and EEC-CoV, with a larger number of smaller recombination areas in the Polymerase RNA based on RNA.
Recombination location is also identified in nsp9, most of Nsp10, and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination between various generation lines was sent to the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in the Saudi Arab Arabic village.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombination has also been reported to HCoV another place where HCoV has experienced re-combination with other CoVs in its non-structural gene.
It must also be observed that the selection of buildings can be involved in unfair changes by viral means, probably by the exemption of virus from the experienced selection pressure, such as the memory immune system.
This effect example is the loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the elimination of two nuclears.
As long as ORF4 is able to be detected by the virus of the fluid and the vial associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV alpha shows an uncleotic nucleotide that causes the trailing.
Lastly, the HCoV evolution has also been moved by the selection pressure in its reservation.
Raw or without signs are detected when the CoV infection was killed, which shows the adjustment between CoV and the disorder.
It seems to be anatomic and physically adapted to CoV.
For example, the report on the effects of pro-inflames response on the slip will effectly remove the patology that CoV thinks.
Furthermore, natural murder cell activity was pressed because the receptor cells were regulated by NKG2/CD94's natural murderers and the complex molecules of histocompatibility in the low class I.
Furthermore, when high reaction oxygen species (ROS) of higher metabolic activity can press CoV replication and affect the correction of exoribonuclease so that the selection pressure for the very patogenic foreign use of the virus can be used when entered into the new inch.
Strain CoV, which is more patogenic, may also develop through recombination, which causes proteins or new protein plants to adjust money.
Therefore, it is not particularly the fact that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decrees.
CoV is unpatogenic, or causes rare signs in the reserve, such as the scarlet and the scarlet.
CoV applies strongly without a powerful response to the powerful money.
There is a secret that there is no signs and causes of serious infections.
Heavy signs are overwhelmed because of excessive immoral response and the sitokin body, with the heavy worst injury if the faith’s response is stronger.
Instead, without signs, the immune response has been removed from the CoV replication.
The same is to resolve the immune response rate may benefit from anti-SARS-CoV-2 terapie.
The response to the interferon is the most powerful in the wallet.
That's why the I interferon interferon, at least at the beginning phase of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, should be useful.
Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflammatic activity is defective.
With this reason, the NLRP3 inflammatic inhibition with MCC950 may benefit from COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 follows the general certificate of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the beta-CoV is found with 95% of the nucleoid homologation with SARS-CoV, there is also a CoV-level that divides 96% of the nucleoid homologation with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the enemy and other animals in that market were found to bring the same virus with SARS-CoV, the intermediate interview for SARS-CoV-2 was not yet found.
Beta-CoV highly approved with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which shows that training may be involved as one of the intermediate money or beta-CoV can be members of the gen fragmen contribution at the end of the SARS-CoV-2 version.
Although there is still a question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by good humans in the way or in the way.
CoV returns to the center of attention because of the SARS-CoV-2 newly.
CoV in other animals and animals has very changed our phrase about the importance of the zoonotic and animal sources for HCoV in human transmission.
Very many evidence show that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originates from the cluster and is transmitted to humans through the crowds.
Remember that SARS-CoV infection is from contacts between humans and enemies in the basic market, may be the middle of the basic market and the murder of all enemies in it that end the SARS epidemie effectively.
With the same reason, the trending should be moved from the basic market to avoid zoo-cov transmission, remembering that there were some beta-CoV seed lines that were close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism were transmitted to humans through training and other materials must still be declared in the future investigation.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV was long in the Arab city.
It works as important transport tools and as the main source of meat, sugar, skin, and wild products for local society.
The Arabic units are increasingly in the East and African East.
That's why we cannot kill all the ships to control MERS, like in the tiongkok farm, to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop MERS, the comprehensive approach must be in place to develop vaccine for effective duty against MERS-CoV and is combined with other infection control steps.
Before we have lost this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause the rain.
A number of CoVs are increasingly lying.
In particular, CoV is a sorcerer who is a zoonotic potential.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to develop and experience recombination, which causes the presentation of new CoVs to be easier transmised and/or more reliable for humans in the future.
In some places in Tiongkok, the culture must be left to reduce the unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 experiences, the preparation and plans of a better exhibition should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since the past.
These viruses are in their natural reservation until there is an opportunity to preach.
Despite a number of circles that support virus preachers, humans are contacted with the scarlets and other natural species can be minimised if they are deducted to defeat the animals.
Surveillance has to be surprised to be more understanding of the CoV environment and its natural memory, which will be beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals and animals.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to avoid the virus zoonosis is that humans must keep away from the ecological recovery of the natural zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic sources are not yet found.
First, if the cluster transfers the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the trend, the conditions when the ecological dilution and the divisions are important to be known.
Second, if a person has a more direct role in the transmission to humans, the way humans have to be contacted with the chairman must be determined.
Third, if there are a third of the treasures that are involved as a real householder, the way the maternity interacts with other species, which cover humans, guards, and trains must be explained.
Finally, because of many males, including animals of survey which may be worth SARS-CoV-2, a good infection of tests and survey must be.
I don't know the bullet, the training, or other maternity, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its identical inductor virus can be identified in its natural inheritance at the time of arrival.
The survey of survey in this field will enhance the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary path in animals, with important implications in preventing and control of COVID-19 on humans.
COVID-19 requires the criteria for "configured case" and "configured case"
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice for diagnosis and control of new coronavir infections 2019 (2019-nCoV) which was based on our experiences and became a good reference to combat the pandemics worldwide.
However, coronaviral disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our conscience and knowledge increasingly based on the clinical and practical experience; therefore, the diagnosis and impact strategy also continues to be conducted.
In this letter, we replied to one comment on our head and set up the new criteria for "consolided case" and "consolided case" based on the diagnosis and intervention of COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Republic of the Tiongkok Commission.
In December 2019, new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an evaporation, which is currently formally called coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus accurate 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed rapid advice and the leadership has been published in the Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
It has been a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it is necessary to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our conscience and knowledge increasingly on the basis of the findings of the riset that are running and the practical experience; therefore, the diagnosis and the diagnosis strategy are also being developed.
As an example of the diagnosis and intervention for COVID-19 issued by the Commission for the National Health of the People's Republic of Tiongkok (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the Commission has completed seven issues with a number of contexts.
We accepted a comment from Zhou et al., they recognized a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
The results of their work have made new evidence for our headships and have become the valuable result of this pandemic worldwide.
We supported the results of their meaningful work and expressed our thanks.
However, the results of their work also needed diagnosis and diagnosis principles for COVID-19 (seventh test tests) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to enhance the most important cases, the combination of one combination of epidemiological revisions with two clinical manifestations is needed to make a comprehensive analysis, or three clinical manifestations are needed if there is no clear epidemiological revision:
Epideological Revision: (1) Revision of traveling or living in the city of Wuhan and its area, or other community where the case of COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before the warrant; (2) contact revision with the case of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nuclear test); (3) contact revision with the patients who experience the destruction or the destruction of the city of Wuhan and its territory, or another community of the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days before the district; (4) contacts with the convergence case (≥ 2 cases with seventy and/or travelling of the district of the city of Wuhan and around 2 weeks in the small area, such as house, officer, class, etc.).
Clinical characteristics: (1) silent and/or inflammation signal; (2) COVID-19 infection detection; (3) total white cell bleeding shows the normal limphosite, or reduced in the early area.
The diagnosis of the convergence case must be based on the basis of one patogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire sequence of the virus shows high homogenity for new known coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum test; or the change of IgG-specific IgG antibiotics from the negative to the positive, or the titer increased ≥4 at the trail phase above the fashion of accurate phase.
We can see that the real-time nuclear PCR tests in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Patogenic detection on blood models included the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was issued to the seventh edition.
This amendment is based on the survey of researchers to search for optimal nuclear detections for quick diagnosis, and an example of the diagnosis including blood movement, which increases the presence of various species, and supports certain positive antibodies results in the constructed criteria.
Moreover, there are more evidence that remind us of being able to observe the patient with the signs of atypics and without signs.
Therefore, many Zhou alir et al. have to be created because they classify people without clinical signs as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in practices and clinical studies in the future.
As a closure, we hope that there will appear more directly and ask for comments.
For the diagnosis of "consolidated cases" and "configured cases, we recommend to follow and obey the newly used governments in each country.
Our team will also build our guards as a bathroom.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths caused COVID-19, the highest day death
In the morning, Bangladesh made five new deaths caused by COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest wine of death in one day of the virus's consequences.
By yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of cases of infections recorded in 114 active cases and 33 health cases living at home.
It's been recorded in total 17 deaths.
In a field newspaper, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the death of four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years, two cases between 51 and 60 years, and one case between 41-50 years.
He also told two sacrifices from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) stated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
An hospital officer reported Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Commission Anti Corruption Bengali, who was interviewed in the House of Kuwait Maitree.
On the Sabbath, in a road video visit, the Road Transport and Jabatan, Obaidul Quader said that the general transport will be stopped longer than the planned, until the Sabbath arrives.
This general transport service has been started since March 26, and the end of the Sabbath, 4 April.
Transport of items needed -- medicals, fires, and instructions -- still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on 8 March, two new people returned from Italy and also one of them.
On March 19, the three were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection over one million wines worldwide
On the Day of Kamis, the total number of cases of coronary infection SARS-CoV-2 undergoing one million in the world, according to Johns Hopkins.
At least 52 thousand deaths were pained with COVID-19, disease caused by corona virus.
At the same time, Malawi was infectioned by the first coron virus and Zambia had the first death of the corrupt virus.
Northern Korea claimed, on the Day of Ours, that the country was one of the little countries that remained free from the corrupt virus infection.
By yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1.05.635 cases, including 79.332 cases within twenty-four hours since 10 hours of the Eastern European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, there are more than 244 thousand cases of corona virus, which caused at least 5.900 deaths.
The CBS news office reports, which highlights the data of Johns Hopkins, is more than 1,000 deaths in the United States of Corona virus infections.
Throughout the world, the nations announce the more urgent action to overcome the disease preacher.
On the day of Kamis, Sergei Sobyanin, Moskow Value, extended the areas to 1 May.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russian citizens will be paid without having to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese parliament makes sound moves to extend the status of the national district for 15 days; the sound move is loosed with 215 voices, ten abstained voices, and one voice refused.
Saudi Arabia was a long night in the holy city of Mekah and Madinah to the whole day; before that, the night was only between the 3th and the 6th morning.
Thailand planned to apply the dinner hour between 10 hours and four tomorrow.
Master Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended the order to live in the house until May 1 May.
Toko-toko is removing the toilet tissue limits for transactions
On Sunday and Sabtu Sunday, the Wollt and Coles network set up the border of the toilet to two and one transaction pair at the national level.
ALDI also applied the border of one master, in the ancient day.
This translation is announced as a message on the box and on the Facebook page.
COVID-19's fears were reported if the society had to make an isolation of the state.
On the day of Rabba, Wool ́ths also decreased a toilet tissue to be rented to home to one pair of messages.
This change followed the four heads of transactions previously applied by Wool ́ths and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
In its media statement on 8 March, Coles reported that with the four sentences, "much toko is still in danger in one hour since the prisoner," and called that request "which ever happened before," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on the southern day, called it "inconsistent."
The sales of the "speed" week ago, according to a jury talks about Wool ́ths.
Toko Costco, in Canberra, also decreased the number that was allowed until two ladies ago.
In order to avoid disturbance, Coles has enhanced greater deficiencies than the employee and increased the frequency of the prison, Wool ́ths offered advantages, while ALDI makes provisions for the activities of the special shepherd’s promotion.
Zimmerman, the Executive Director of Periodic Association, says that the perimeter tries to increase the provision, but the limits of the local government’s body for the time of the traveller make it difficult.
He focused on the payment of production, the pursuit of the manufacturer attempted to fulfill the request, and a smaller promotion.
On the last day, ALDI announced that because he had lost the first arrangements, some of them could not be assigned to the special Shepherd.
In a report of News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, the director of Queensland, of Technology, says that the toko has been prepared at night.
He insisted that the toilet tissue was a big volume so that the number of its provisions were lower and, if it was sold, make many empty rooms in the rocks so the inflammation of things was more sensitive.
Coles and Wool ́ths are [they] if there are many things in the race, if products such as toilet and service tissues can [dibeli] and there are in a large number, where may be minimised, Russell Zimmerman through the ABC News Office.
The manufacturer of the renewable toilet toilet, who Gives a Crap, said that they were in the past day of the shepherd.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Tessu Toilet Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, pressed them to work 24/7 to watch the business, according to the news.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real state, reports that some property sales offer free toilet tissues to the first toilet offerer in Melbourne, when more delayed because they took the stage for long release on the end of the Sunday.
The Edition of Cams NT News, a day in Darwin, provides eight pages of the site that were intended to be packed and used as a toilet tissue.
Toko-toko did not apply the limits, according to the ABC report on 3 March, they said that they were not planning to apply the limits.
Zimmerman suggested that other products were also in high requests, including maskers, preliminary, warmness, hand-coat, and tissue.
Similarly, on Monday, the supermarket soon around England Ocado was decreased by Andres’ toilet tissue to two pounds of 12 bullets.
World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemic
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports the COVID-19 events that occur — disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus – as pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only admits the number of diseases that have been divorced, not the dangers of that case, the WHO needs to encourage governments to act:
All countries are still able to change this pandemic road.
If the country detects, tests, controls, isolations, and moves his people as response, the Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were very careful because of the preachers and the preachers that are concerned, as well as because of anxiety.
According to Dr. Tom Peace, the director of the Governing Body and the United States Sickness of the United States, this pandemic "which ever happened before."
He said, in a report published by CNN in February, "unless the influenza, there is no virus of the inflammation that has ever been thrown from its capabilities to a wonderful global preaching."
Ghebreyesus explained the same view, saying, "It's never seen a pandemic that was thought by coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the time together."
The new pandemic state followed the WHO decision in January, which declared this as a special government of social health that is in the world.
Director National Institute of Allergy and Infectionous Disease of Serikat America, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said, "They're going to be worse."
Till Wes, Press reported at least 126.000 cases COVID-19 in the world, which caused more than 4.600 deaths.
Coronavirus 2019-2020 is the coronaviral 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is continued and caused by coronavirus accurate 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The sign was identified in Wuhan, Tiongkok, December 2019, as a unit of the Social Health Health of the World on January 30, 2020, and was described as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1,61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial regions, which caused about 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364.000 people have been cured.
The case's fatality was considered 4% in Tiongkok, while in the whole world, from 13,04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The general signs were thrown down, rocks, and along.
Complication can affect pneumonia and accurate syndrome.
Since the magazine was packed to the general, about five days, but it could begin from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antivirus treatment.
The main advice is symptomatic and sustainable therapy. The recommended preventive action is to cut off the hands, shut down the mouth on the bottom, keeping away from others, and counting and isolation for people who are infectioned.
The authorities around the world have responded with members of the border, the karantine, the evening, the workshops, and the facilities.
This pandemic has caused a heavy global economy, harmful, cultural, political, religious, etc., and the extreme disagreement of panic businesses.
School and university have been closed at the national and local level in 193 countries, which affects around 99.4 percent of the worldwide students.
Misinformation about this virus has divided the blood and there are incidences of xenofobia and discrimination against the Tionghoa people with the seed and appearance of the East Asia and the East Asia, and those from the area with a significant virus case.
As a result of traveling and heavy industries, air poultry and carbone are lost.
Health Authority in Wuhan, Tiongkok (subject of Hubei’s property), reported the pneumonia case classer with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and studied at the beginning of January 2020.
These cases are most terrified with the Great Sea Food Passer, and therefore the virus was deemed to have a zoonotic source.
The virus that causes the vial is called SARS-CoV-2, new virus found and associated with the coronavirus, the coronavirus calling, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with a sign then was known to fall sick on December 1, 2019, and that man has no clear concern with the class of the basic markets that later mentioned.
Among the first case classer reported in December 2019, two thirds were able to have an interview with that market.
On March 13, 2020, an uncertain report from South China Morning Post concluded that a case that could be televised to 17 November 2019, at a 55-year-old of Hubei province, may be the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, with a new case reported in Tiongkok, it was recently increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside Tiongkok had taken the number of new cases in Tiongkok for the first time.
Perhaps there are many cases that are not reported, especially among people who have a lower sign.
By 26 February, relatively few cases reported between young people, with 19 years of age underwards 2,4% of the cases worldwide. As the British scientists, Patrick Vallance, acknowledges that 60% of the British population needed to be infected before the inflammation can be achieved.
The case recognises the number of persons who have been tested COVID-19 and whose results have been constructed positively by the recipient protocol.
By 23 March, there is no country testing more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made a practice to avoid testing people with a raw sign, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Swiss.
A study published on March 16 found that in Tiongkok, until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumentated infection is a source of infection for 79% documented cases.
An analysis published on 30 March suggested that the infections in Italy were higher than the reported cases.
The beginning of the basic reproduction wheat (R0) for COVID-19 is 1,4 to 2,4.
A study published by the Governing Body and the American Medical Sickness concluded that the wine could be 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 guests are healthy.
For the unhealthy, from the 6 - to 41 - day development of signs, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths were threatened with COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, until five February, about 80% of death occurred to age over 60 years and 75% had a previous health disorder, which caused cardiovascular and diabetes diseases. Real death calculation results of COVID-19 generally claimed to the dead persons who have a positive test for COVID according to the recipient protocol.
The fact that the fatality caused COVID-19 may be much higher, remembering the most probably a person who died without testing, for example, in the house, in the house, in the home, in the dsb.
Parcial data from Italy discovered that the number of death wine over during the pandemy was overcoming the COVID mortal calculation with factor 4-5 times.
A woman talks to the Centre of Control and CCDs (USC) of Sickness admits, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than its real wine," a statement strengthened by an uncertain report on the counting too low in the United States. The calculation that is too low appeared in the pandemics, like the H1N1 fluid epidemic in 2009. The first death is in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside Tiongkok occurred on 1 February in Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside the Territory Tiongkok, more than thousands of deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and territorial regions have reported death in the field, except in the Antarctic areas, which are generally used to calculate mortality.
This is based on areas and time, and is affected by the number of studies, the quality of health care systems, the options, the time since the first time, and the nature of the population such as age, the species of age, and the health of otherwise. The death ratio to the case indicates the number of deaths is divided in a specific time range of cases.
According to Johns Hopkins, the death ratio on global cases was 6,0% (97.039/7/67.204) on 10 April 2020.
This is part of the territory.
In Tiongkok, the death ratio on cases was decreased from 17,3% (including people with the signature of 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (which has been used as a signature after 1 February 2020). Other incidence affects the fatality of case (CFR), which indicates the percent of the mortal diagnosis of individuals who died from certain diseases, and the infection fatality (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (diagnosis and undiagnosised) who died from certain diseases.
This statistics have not been timed and followed the particular population begins from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these wine for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicines of Oxford suggests that the infection fatality of the infections for the end of 0.1% to 0.39%.
The results of the first COVID-19 study in Germany and an analysis of the impact of the tests on the CFR discussion.
WHO claims that this pandemic can be controlled.
This is not clear and may be different by locally.
Maciej Boni from Penn State said, "If no one is controlled, it's usually acting and then starting to delay when the disease is available for money.
But the hampire is not possible to make a meaningful project at this time about when it happens."
The anti-governmental medical advice of Tiongkok Zhong Nanshan believes that "they can end June" if the whole country can be mobilised to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the virus preliminary.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "should be stuck, probably for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College research conducted by Neil Ferguson, physics and other steps will be needed "to the vaccine available (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt said, "I feel small that this coronavirus, because it is very easy to be transmised, can lose all of it" and "the disease may be changed to music disease, which comes back to the year."
Virulency will depend on the inflammation and mutation rate.
COVID-19 signs can be relatively unspecific and the infected can be without signs.
The two most common signals are a silent (88%) and a warm (68%).
The signals that I am often determined to overcome disturbance, the production of sputs of disturbance (flegma), the loss of the cup, the throat, the throat, the throat, the illness of the head, the pain of the head, the illness, the hemoptic, the diar, or the synthesis. The WHO stated that about one of the six people became sick and experienced in trouble.
U.S. Control and Disturbance (CDC) is the point of decreasing the signals of the accident, pressed or semi-pressed, disturbing, distressing, traveling, and disorders; Medical attention is soon advised if these signs appear. The development of the diseases can be more pneumonia, the syndrome of appeal, the sepsis, the sectics, and the death.
Some who are infected may be asymptotic, without clinical signals, but with tests of infection, therefore, the investigator recommends that those who are close to those who are infected have to be tested to be uninfected.
The people of Tionghoa were increasingly disappointed from some to 44 percent.
Inkubase periods (which between infections and mystery) were usually spending between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days. As an accident, the number of COVID-19 people lost 30% of the early visitors and then returned to 15%.
Instructions on the way this disease is still discussed.
The COVID-19 preacher is primarily occurred in the nearby contact and through a small droppet resulting in the rock, shipping, or speaking; the nearby contact is a contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies found that uncovered stone could cause droplets from 4,5 meters (15 feet) to 8,2 meters (27 feet).
Some surveys may also be used by a small droplet that has longer endured in the air and has been made when talking. Droplets can also be done when running, including when talking, although this virus is not generally translated through the air.
Droplet can fall in the mouth or the hidden of a person who is near him or may be cast into the pools.
Some medical processes, such as intubacy and intuition of the heart (RJP), can make secrets changed to the sun, and they are spent through the air.
The preaching work can also happen when a person touchs the contaminated inflammation, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, the mouth, and the mouth.
Although there is anxiety that the virus can spread through the festivals, the risk is low.
The Government of Tiongkok shows the potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the first three days after the story, although the preach may occur before the sign of vision and in the next disease.
People have received positive tests until three days before a sign, which provides the transmission may occur before there are significant signs.
Only a few cases of asymptotic reports constructed by age, but the asimto is identified by some countries during the investigation of the contact investigation.
The ECDC (ECDC) stated that although it is not clear how easy this disease is to divorce, one generally infected two to three people. This virus can remain in the heat for a few hours until the days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected until three days on plastic (polypropylen) and the station of 304, one day on the card, and more than four hours a second.
However, this is dependent on lacking and swimming animals and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can cause virus to humans, although the British authority recommends to cut hands after contact with animals, such as after contacting the potential infectioned persons.
Coronavirus is a new virus for the first time is isolated from three pneumonia patients who are threatened with the Classer of acute disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 viruss are threatened with coronavirus in the natural. Outside human body, this virus can be destroyed if the households are covered, which sets its protective amplop. SARS-CoV-2 worked with the first SARS-CoV.
Virus was considered to have a zoonotic source.
Genetic analysis shows that the coronavirus is genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in Sarbecovirus subgenus (seed B) together with two bullets.
This virus has 96% comparison on the entire level through another coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Tionghoa investigators found that there was only a difference between one amino acid in certain parts of the results of the virus of human reception and human virus.
To this time, the total comparison by finding the most many are 92% of the genetical equality between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that the convocation is the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate.
Infection by virus can be diagnosed as a result of a signal, but confiscation at the end by the reaction of the back-polymerase transcriptase (rRT-PCR) to the secret infected or through the CT detection.
A study compared between PCRs with CT in Wuhan shows that CT is more sensitive than PCR, but I do not have a specific, with a lot of phytopharmaceutical phytosanes that are involved with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, American College of Radiology comments: "CCT cannot be used to write or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has issued a number of RNA analysis protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first issued on 17 January.
Testing uses the reaction of the polymerase transcripty back-time (RRT-PCR).
The tests can be found in an example of blood or blood.
The general results are available within a few hours until a few days.
In general, these tests are in use at the use of a non-sofaring, but the use of the inflammation can also be used, and some of the companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, no one of the serological tests proved sufficiently accurate to accept its use.
In the United States, serological tests developed by Cellex have been accepted for use of a hydrautic use, only by uncertified cipium.
Caracteristics of radiographic and tomography figures computated (CT) to those who feel that the potential of aximeter glass perifer is the opacity and that there is no pleasure efficiency.
The Italian Radiological Society is being prepared for the international area databases to find discovery in constructed cases.
Since other infections are infectioned, such as adenovirus, the recognition without PCR confiscation has limited ability to identify COVID-19.
A major investigation in Tiongkok compares the results of the CT CT with the PCR and shows that, despite the specific infections, the detection is faster and more sensitive so that it is recommended to be considered as an encryption tool in the epidemic area.
The neural convolution network based on building understanding has been developed to detect virus detection with radiographic and CT.
In order to avoid the illness of this disease, it is to take care of a good personal cleanness, to cut off the hands, to avoid touching the eyes, the mouth, or the mouth before wearing the hands, and to use the tissue when wearing or wheat, and directly remove the tissue to the middle.
A person who may have been infected has been recommended to use a hard mask at the general place.
It is also recommended that the governments in various areas have distorted or encouraged to stop the non-sensitive travels from the country and the regions.
However, the majority of the world’s areas have reached the preaching of the public scale.
This means that the virus has been divided in society, and some social members do not know where or how they are infected.
The use of local data from phone by governments for this purpose has caused privacy problems, with the outcome of a statement from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that require such survey responsibilities.
A number of applications have been implemented or designed to be pleasantly used, and on April 7, 2020, more than a thousand of phones worked a large private solution, such as Bluetooth used to record the user's remote approach to other phones.
Next, users will receive a message if they are close to someone who has been tested positively for COVID-19.There is a misunderstanding about how to prevent infection; for example, we are stuck and weigh with ineffective chemicals.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
The hands were called to avoid the illness preacher.
The CDC recommends that people often cut off their hands with hair and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands appear to be cut; before eating; and after splitting food, stone, or wheat.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by the rocks of a house that destroyed its protector’s head.
Moreover, the CDC emphasizes the use of basic alcoholic preservation with alcohol can be reduced by less than 60 per cent of the volume when weapons and waters are not available.
WHO encourages people to avoid touching the eyes, the oil, or the mouth before they cut their hands.
The decontamination may be used in a number of levels (in one minute, infectioned for a cardiovascular survival), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100%, hypochloride sodium 0.1%, peroxide 0,5% and povidone-iodine 0.2-7.5%.
Other areas, such as chloride benzalconium and chlorohexidine gluconate, have been effective.
CDC recognises that if the case of COVID is obtained or constructed in general difficulty, such as office or child-wide location, all areas such as office, rooms, general areas, electronic devices together as tablets, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by the repository must be disinfekted.
The health organisation recommends that people hide their mouths and hide their mouths with a thickness or use the tissue when the tissue or the wheel is cut off and then immediately remove the tissue.
It is recommended for people who may have been infected because using the mask can reduce the volume and the time of the dropped expirators that are broken when talking, sharing, and stomach.
The WHO has expelled the instructions on the time and way of mask sealing.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virological expert in the Leeds, "Masker can reduce the incidence of people to touch the face with unclean hands, which is the principal source of throat."Masker is also recommended to be taken by those who care for others who may urge this disease.
WHO recommends that healthy people use the masker only if they are highly risked, like those who care COVID-19, although WHO also admits that use of maskers can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have started using the mask to the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of a nonmedical face mask made from the town. The rock specifically recommends the use of the medical mask at the time of healthy society, especially when you approach (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong reminds us that the mask mask is used when using the general wheat or living in many places.
Thailand’s health career encourages people to make a cheap mask in the house and cut it on the day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited their community to the community without masking or hiding the mouth and the mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested all his citizens to use a face mask when they went to the general place to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has destroyed those who enter the tozerba to use a face mask.
The Israelites asked all his citizens to use a mask of faces when they were in the community.
Bywan, who produced ten million maskers per day since the middle of Maret, forced fire carriers and antarcotic bus to carry out the face mask on 1 April.
Manama forced the use of the face mask once outside the house, and commented on the mask of the building mask for those who cannot buy a face mask.
In Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore, the masker was also highly used.
Social interactions (including physics) are the infection controls that are intended to reduce the disease prevalence by minimising contacts close to individuals.
Society methods follow the karantine; traveling; school, job, station, theater, or exhibition center.
Many can apply social responsibilities by living in the house, build travel, avoid a lot of areas, use health without contact, and keep the physical courses of others.
Today, many governments are committed or supported by social responsibilities in the areas that are increasing.
The number of people who are collected by the US governments and health organizations are quickly reduced, starting from 250 people (which is not known there's a COVID-19 in the area) becomes 50 people, and then 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibited the meetings in the public area that included more than two people. Ancients and medical conditions based on diabetes, heart diseases, hypertension, and immune systems that have a serious risk of serious disease and complication that are recommended for more than two people.
The use is "social interactions" that people have to isolate themselves totally socially and do not motivate people to remain connected with others in alternative ways.
This recommendation includes a invitation to sexual relations only with people who live with you and do not have virus or virus signals.
The isolation is located in the home recommended for people who diagnosed the COVID-19 and those who were infectioned.
A number of governments have committed or recommendated the career for all the populations living in the area.
The karantine instructions are the most significant instructed for people including high risks.
A person who may be presented to COVID-19 and those recently passed to the country or area with the COVID-19 preacher, which is recommended to carantine age for 14 days since the last chance of the parking.
In the middle of the divorce, it is objection or suppression, and meditation.
Reviews were at the beginning and purpose of discovering and isolating those infected and other steps to control infections and vaccination intended to stop the disease preliminary to the population.
When it is not possible anymore to support the disease preliminary, the next effort is to go to the medical level: these steps are taken to late the preaching and reduce its impact on health and society care systems.
Combination of purposes and misguides can be at the same time.
Suppression needs more extreme steps to replace pandemics by reducing the basic reproduction wheat to be less than 1.
This causes the risk of health care and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatment.
The non-pharmaceutical intervention to handle the practice of individual impairment, such as the cleaning of hands, using face maskers and carantines; the steps in the social level that are applied for physical statement, such as closing schools and cancelling the arrangements of mass meetings; the public release to stimulate the receipt and share in such interventions; and the steps in the environment, such as the cleaning of the discovery. Another drastic is intended to determine the reality in the Tiongkok at the time of the reality, such as decreasing the entire city and decreasing the traveling.
Other countries also apply a number of steps intended to deal with the virus preacher.
South Korea reported the local massal and karantine, and warned about the movement of infected people.
Singapura provides financial support for infected people who make karantine standing and enjoying a big depth for those who fail to do so.
Increasing the production of the face mask and condemning medical surveys, the simulation of British and Greek Americans shows that mitigacy (slowly, but not stop epidemic preliminary) and supreme (increasing epidemic growth) has great challenges.
The optimal mitigacy rules can reduce the demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still cause thousands of deaths and health systems.
The supreme can be selected, but it needs to be maintained while the virus is still in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first thing is achieved), because if not, the running will quickly turn back when the supreme steps are controlled.
The long intervention to press pandemics has a impact on social and economic.
There are no specific antivirus medicines that are agreed for COVID-19, but the development efforts are in − which include already existing medicine studies.
Increasing freely sold fluides, drinking enough water, and silence can help us to disturb the signals.
On the basis of the oxygen rate, the oxygen rate, the intravenous rate, and the infection support may be needed.
steroid use can cause the patient’s condition.
Some of those previously agreed for treatment of other virus diseases are studied to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and household" can produce a sign caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increased capacity and health service for the needs of COVID-19 is a basic step in response to the response.
ECDC and the European Regional WHO Office have enhanced the patient for hospitals and health services in the first way to develop the sources in various areas, including focusing the service for COVID-19, if it allows to cancel the electrical process, separate and isolate the positive COVID-19 patients, and increase the potential of intensive advertising by training personnel and enhancing the number of ventilators and sleeping.
There are various theories about the first source of the case (nol patients).
The first known case of coronavirus can be identified at 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
In a month, the number of cases of coronavirs in Hubei increased in time.
These cases are greatly scared with the Great Sea Food Passer, who also sold live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic source. A classer of pneumonia is not known on December 26, and was handled by Dr Zhang Jixian in the Hubei Province House, which membered to know the CDC Jiang Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a doctor's school in the House of the Point Wuhan members knew their companions about "coronavirus like SARS".
The eight of this doctor, including Li Wenliang, was warned by the police because he made hundreds of false people, and others, Ai Fen, were determined by him because of the warning that he was made.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then delivered public communications on December 31 and members of the WHO.
Many cases of pneumonia are not known to the health authorities in Wuhan who then studied at the beginning of January. At the beginning, the number of cases increased twice seven times a half day.
In the beginning and middle of January 2020, the virus was distributed to other Tiongkok provincies, supported by the new Year of Imlek and because Wuhan was the central transport centre and the main fire trailing centre.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following recent data show that 6 174 people have experienced a sign on January 20, 2020. On 26 March, the Greek Americans have passed Tiongkok and Italy with the highest number of cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases have been reported throughout the world; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 are healthy.
About 200 countries and territorial regions have at least one case.
Because of the pandemics in Europe, many countries in the Schengen village deployed free movement and made the control of limits.
The national view follows the steps of the purposes, such as the karantine (known as the order of living in the house, protected in the area, or in the area) and in the evening. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in the Charantine of the region in the Serikat America, more than 50 million people were carantined in the Philippines, about 59 million people were carantined in South Africa, and 1,3 billion people were carantined in India.
On March 26, 1,7 billion people worldwide were in the areas of karantine, which increased to 2,6 billion people two days later, some of the world’s population.
The first constructed case COVID-19 can be retrieved to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one report that has not yet been constructed shows the first case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed the classer of pneumonia cases not known on December 26; this observation was reported to the CDC Jianghan on December 27.

In the world, the cultures and cultural heritage sectors are very largely viewed by pandemics, which affect the operation of organizations and individuals, well-inspected or inhabited.
Arts and cultures are trying to fight their missions (which is often undertaken) to provide cultural heritage access to society, to protect the security of workers and society, and to support art if possible.
In March 2020, in the world and at different levels, Museum, Employment, Assembly, and other cultures were closed without time, with a warrant, appeal, and its orders were cancelled or dismissed.

Since COVID-19, it was observed that there were a disaster, xenofobia, and racism against the people of Tionghoa and East Asia, and people of the regions in Europe, the Syriat America, and other countries.
The incidence of fear, furnishment, and disturbance in many countries, mainly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pacific regions.
The report from February (when the majority of the cases are still limited in Tiongkok) records the sensation of racisms shown in many groups worldwide that Tionghoa is worth receiving virus or accepting what they claim as an appropriate debt.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced anti-Tiongkok-sensitivity.
Many people of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their origin.
There's a support for the Tionghoa people, a good blood and aerodrome, and for the people in the areas that are infected with virus.
The development of the new hotspot countries, the Italian people, the first country in Europe who experienced a serious COVID-19, could also be a crowd and xenophobia. The people in the countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the South Korea at first submit to the petition to prohibit the Tionghoa people in the efforts to stop diseases.

Anuum test for coronaviral diseases 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 includes a method that detects virus events and detects antibodies produced as response to infection.
The virus conditions in the model are convergenced with RT-PCR, which detected RNA coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 at a time.
This test is used to enhance new or still active infections.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used for diagnosis and survey of population.
An antibodies tests show the number of individuals who have been expelled, whose signs are too slow to report or without signs.
The results of this test can be determined by the accurate mortality of the disease and the decrease of the population.
Since the limited study, until March 2020, there are no specific data on virus prevalence in its population.
By 23 March, there is no country testing more than 3 per cent of its population, and there is a large variety in the number of educations that have been in the countries.
This variable may also affect the significant significance of the fatality of the cases reported, which may have been calculated too high in some countries.
Using the realtime-time polymerase transcription reactions (rRT-PCR), this test can be used in a model of installation that is used by various methods, including use of non-time or sputum.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests that are in the past of the throat can only be reported in the first week of illness.
Then, the virus can disappear in the throat of the throat continues to explode in the cup.
Alternatively, for the infections tested in the second weeks, the samples can be taken from the inflammation inside by using the wheel category or by the sput (sputum).
One initial PCR test was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time transcription reaction (RRT-PCR), and at least 250,000 tests for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The British Raya also developed research on 23 January 2020.South Korean companies developed the SARS-CoV-2-based PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) based on clinics on 28 January 2020.
In Tiongkok, the BGI Group was one of the first companies that accepted the use of the National Media Product Tiongkok for the SARS-CoV-2 detection tools. In the Serial America, the Government and the CCDC Center, distributed the RT-PCR Real-Time Coronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) to the public health architecture through International Reagen Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test tool provides uncertain results due to reaction errors, and the number of CDC studies in Atlanta is limited; this causes less than 100 models per day processed in February 2020.
The testing of two components is considered not to be reported until February 28, 2020, and now after that, the country of parts and local authorities were allowed to be conducted.
This test was approved by the United States Trade Watchtower and Food Board based on the Darurat Usage Authorisation. The US commercial laboratorium began to study at early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the COVID-19-based RT-PCR at the national scale.
Similarly, the Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 studies available nationally on 9 March 2020.
There is no quantity limit to be declared; the collection and specimen collection must be according to the CDC provisions.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the Centre of Virological and BioVECTOR Rissets.
On 11 February 2020, this test was reported by the Federal Service for Health Surveillance. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to identify COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an agreement on the FDA for a study that could be performed during 3,5 hours with a high volume, so that one machine could perform about 4.128 studies at 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the authorization of the use of the US to Abbott Laboratories to study on the 2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously exempted the same authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also accepted the United States from the FDA for a study of approximately 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a study that uses the isotermal nuclear amplification that is not PCR.
Because there is no need for a cycle of swimming, this method can give positive results only in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Now there are approximately 18.000 machines in the United States and Abbott focused on increased production until 50,000 tests per day. The test using monochloral antibodies specifically using nucleocapsid protein (N) is developed in Taiwan, hoped that new coronavirus can result in 15 to 20 minutes like rapid influenza tests.
One of the missionaries issued in March 2020 concluded that "foto toracs have small values at the beginning, while the CT [computed tomography] might have been before the story.
The fashion of the CT includes the opacity of bilateral multiplayers with perifer distribution, asymetry, and later.
Subpleural domination, paving crazy, and consolidation resulted in the development of the disease.
In Wuhan, a PCR-based study with CT at this point shows that the CT is more sensitive than PCR, although I have to be specific, with many pharmacokinetic figures of pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology comments: "CT cannot be used to write or as the first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19." On March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for the first writer.
The part of the immune response to infection is the determination of antibodies covering IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections on individuals since approximately 7 days after the signal advertising, to determine immunity against disease, and in population survey.
Automatic system with high results in many clinical powers will be able to do this control, but it will depend on the level of production for systems.
For C., one species of perifer blood is generally used, although the species can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, one species of peripheral blood was generally used through the skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 persons that provide knowledge to the agency as needed and that is why they can now distribute their antibodies tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics have received the European approval for their test tools that can identify IgG and IgA antibiotics against virus in blood model.
The testing capacity is to have a few grades in a few hours, so far more faster than the conventional PCR control against RNA virus.
At first April, the British Raya found that no antibodies tests were used enough to use.
Hong Kong has set a scheme for the patient to live in the house, "the department will give the patient a species of the patient," they went into it, sent it back, and received the results of the tests later. The NHS announced that NHS is pioneering the appropriate case review scheme in the house so that the risks of patients will be lost if they come to the hospital or must disinfekte ambulance if they are used. In the COVID-19, a professional health enemy will take an example of using the appropriate disabilities.
On 2 March, the National Property of Statutory Health Insurance of German physicians said that Germany had approximately 12.000 tests per day in the road service and 10.700 studies had been held in the previous week.
If a doctor requests an examination, a payment is charged by a health career.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, the survey was offered in some large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests in Germany was not known because only the positive results were reported.
A first survey shows that at least 483.295 models have been tested to 12/2020 and 33.491 models (6.9%) positive tests for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers in Sakit Technion and Rambam have developed and tested the method of testing the example of 64 patients together, associating the example and testing only if the example was found positively. In Wuhan, the detective of the dairy detection of approximately 2.000 meters is called "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: ­ ­ ­ §, or "Api" in Indonesia) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which could be processed more than 10,000 examples.
With his demand, BGI Wang Jian's specialist was monitored and spent five days, the model shows that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the threatened payment for karantine attacks could be doubled if there is no educational capacity.
Wuhan Laboratorium was soon followed by Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total 12 cities in the whole Tiongkok.
On 4 March 2020, the total ability of its day is about 50,000 tests per day. The Origami Assasy's open source design can test most of the 22 models of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 interviews. This equivalent design can be traveled in small bodies without the need of robotic appeal.
In the month of Maret, the minority and the number of reactions that are not enough have become a mass study in the United States of Europe, the United States of Raya, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers tried to explore the examples of the 98 °C (208 °F) - exhibition protocol for 5 minutes to release the RNA for further study. On March 31, the Arab Emirates Units were reported to make more coronaviral studies than any country, and ready to increase the study scale to reach a large population.
This is accomplished through the combination of lattural research and the mass results of the population of the group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" detection in Tiongkok).
In 14 days, this is able to make decades of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and it is the first one who has this scale outside Tiongkok.
A number of studies suggested by various components of the coronavirus genetic profile is developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and Serikat America.
World Health Organization advocates German receptions for the production of tests sent to the countries that are low without the source of the development of their own.
Recept German was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sickness Management Centre is not available until 28 January so that it late the available studies in the United States. At the beginning, Tiongkok and the United States were injured with testing instruments; these two countries and they cannot provide enough tests to perform the request and recommendations of health research.
Instead, the leader states that the highest pressure in South Korea has helped to reduce the new coronavirus preaching.
The educational capacity, most of the sanctuary sector, was destroyed in a few years by the South Korea Government.
On March 16, World Health Organization invited the educational programme as the best way to reduce the COVID-19 pandemic inhibition. A high request for study because a major virus preacher causes thousands of studies to wait in the United States South Africa, and the preparation for use and chemical reactions.
In March 2020, Tiongkok reported the accurate issues of their testing tools.
In the Serikat America, the CDC testing device has "cacat"; the government then removes the birocracy that prevents the education of the Swiss. Spanish sold tests from the company Tiongkok Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that its results were not accurate.
The company explains that the uncertain results may cause mistakes in collecting an example or using the test tools correctly.
The Spanish campaign says that they're going to add an incorrect output, and put it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the tests from the Czech Republic from Tiongkok was wrong. Slovakia sold 1,2 million tests from Tiongkok that appeared to be uncertain.
The leader Matovicz recommended that the tests be removed to the Danube river. The Kara attempt from the Turkish Health Chamber says that the tests from Tiongkok have "height errors" and they do not "use it." The English Raya sold 3,5 million tests from Tiongkok, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that this test was not used.
The tests, followed by the karantine of those who tested positively and discovered those who contacted the SARS-CoV-2 positive, received a positive end result.
The researchers worked in Vó Italia, the first place of death in COVID-19 in Italy, performed two studies in all the populations of 3.400 people, with approximately 10 days.
About half of those tested positively have no signs, and all cases found in karantine.
By traveling to this community, new infections are all overwhelmed.
By detecting agressive contacts, increasing traveling, research, and carantine, the coronavirus 2020 pandemics in Singapore developed far more than other countries, despite the extreme extent, such as the mixture of restaurants and ritel companies.
Many of them were canceled, and Singapore recommended the residents to live at home on 28 March, but schools were opened right after the department on 23 March.
Some other countries also handle pandemics with an aggressive contact, an appeal to traveling, study, and carantine, but with not too aggressive areas, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A study finds that the countries testing more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower case fatality, perhaps because these countries are more able to detect people who have a sign or without a sign.
WHO recommends that nationals who do not have educational capacity, and nationality with limited COVID-19 experiences, send five first positive COVID-19 and ten first negative examples to one of the 16th WHO areas for confirmation.
From 16 years of age, 7 was in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, 1 in America.
In this context, the column "%Positive Experience" is affected by the rules of the country's education.
The country that only tests people who are concerned in the hospital will have a percentage of higher positive results than the country that tests all its populations, and they show the signs or not, with other factors.
Its hands, which are also called with cleanness of hands, is the action to purify the hands of someone who intends to lose the depth, oil, microeme, or another undetermined powder.
Cut hands with a consistent hand on the "critical seat" a certain day to prevent the predictation of many diseases, such as diarr and colera, which was expressed through the fecal-oral path.
Many may also be able to have a disease, such as a influenza or a severe, if they do not cut off their hands before touching the eyes, the mouth, or the mouth.
Five times a very important day criticism is: before and after the big water waste, after the kids were cleaned or put off, before a child washed, before eating and after preparing meat, fish, or mixing.
If there is no water and water, the hands can be cleaned with a wheat.
Earlier, when, and after preparing for advice.
Before and after care of the sick.
Just put the pockets on or clean the kids that just used the toilet.
Just clean up the wheat, the wheat, or the wheat.
Just touch animals, animals, or animals.
Medical cleaning of hands claims to the practice of cleanness related to medical procedures.
Take your hands before giving medicines or medical advice can prevent or reduce the disease preliminary.
The main medical goal is to remove the hands of the patogen (bacteria, virus, or other microemes that may cause disease) and chemical diseases that may cause the disease or disease.
This is too important for people who are in the medical field or work, but it is also important for public society.
Many benefits of health, including minimising influenza, corona virus and other diseases; preventing diarrhoea causes; reducing infections;
and reduce the child’s mortality wheat to healthy homes.
In 2013, practical instructions can reduce the growth of the battle children.
In the developing country, the mortality of children can be reduced by providing a change of simple behaviour, such as cutting their hands with a milk.
This simple action can reduce the mortality wine of that disease to nearly 50%.
The intervention that prevents the hands can reduce the case’s decreasing to around it; the intervention can be used by setting clean water in the low-leaving area.
48 per cent of the cases can be painted with the hands of the hands with the bottle. Cutting hands with the bottle is the only way that is most effective and irrelevant to prevent diarrhoea and acute infection (ISPA), as the underlying behaviour in the house, school, and society worldwide.
Pneumonia, the principal ISPA, is the cause of the death of a battle child; this disease causes about 1,8 million children per year.
Diare and pneumonia caused nearly 3,5 million children to die.
According to UNICEF, make hands with a cup before eating and after use of the toilet to be a deceased habit can save more lives or any medical action, and reduce death to the middle and death results of acute infection until four.
Its common hands are associated with other health activities as part of water, health and cleanness programs (WASH).
It also protects himself from the empetigo that is expressed directly through physical contacts.
Small effects cut off their hands is a hands - strike that often causes the skin to cause the skin infections of the skin.
In 2012, in Denmark found that the screening of the hands could cause the condition of the skin of the skin, which is known as the exhibition of hands or dermatitis, which mostly occurred in health employees.
It also seems too often to be one of the symptoms of compulsif-compulsif (OCDs).
There are five times of criticism all day when the hands are cut off with a bottle is important to reduce the illness of oral disease: before and after use of the toilet (small water, big water) after the kids (using pook), before eating the child, before eating and/or after preparing meat, fish, or mixing.
Another important time to apply the technique to cut the right hands to prevent the illness of the disease is before and after the hurt; after the wine, the rock, or the throat, after touching the animals or the animals; and after touching the sampling.
In many countries, the ships are still low.
A study on the broadcast in 54 countries in 2015 discovered that the rate of 38.7% of the houses were increasing their hands with a bathroom. A 2014 study shows that Saudi Arabs had the highest level of 97 percent; the American Science is in the middle of 77 percent; and Tiongkok at the amount of 23 per cent. Now there are some changes in my conduct to increase the adjustment of my behaviour in the period of criticism. It puts the hands to study at the time that has been determined is one election in the countries developed to make the hands of their children.
The Department of Education in the Philippines was an example of the right steps to support health and training.
The administration of a cake of two times a year, sharing the hands of the day with a daily teeth with fluoride, is the key of this national programme.
This program has also been applied in Indonesia.
Microemetic cleaning from the skin is strengthened with water-scale or detergen.
The main work of deterioration is to reduce the rights to enhance and increase the deterioration.
The water is only an inefficiency of the skin, which is the organic cotton component, is not easy in the water.
Instead, heat and protein are helped by sufficient water allocation.
Soon at the same time, because his characteristics can be used back, it may be possible to reduce the previous use of the bacteria.
A number of small studies that investigate bacteria’s disorder from the concomitant damage concluded that the disorder is unable to occur because the bacterial is used by bus.
Yet, the CDC continues to say "the wheat that he's running out of the wheel without touching his hands more likely."
An anti-bactery seeds were largely avoided to a healthy society.
There is no evidence that the use of antiseptic or uninfected use is better for an antibiotic body in the world.
However, an antibactery stone is a general antibacteria agent like a triclosan, which contains a significant severe body.
Thus, although an antibiotic stranger is not affected by antibacteria, this can not be effective.
Besides the surface and the skin protection of the skin, the fluid formulation can include assets (society, ascorbat axes, lactates) as pH, benzoates as active antimicrobians, and further skin conditions (lease, vitamin, tolerance, extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University Health Factory of Oregon shows that the common potassium is the same effective with an anti-buxed antibactery anti-buctery containing triclose in preventing diseases and eliminating the bacteria from hands.
The warm water is not enough to kill bacteria.
The plant battery is faster on the body (37 °C).
Heavy water is more efficient than that of cold water in the loss of natural oil that holds cotors and bacteria.
However, with the confidence of many people, scientific studies show that heat water use does not have any effect in reducing the number of microbs in their hands.
Man or an antiseptic service is an unbased cleaning agent.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21th century, the cleaning of the hands was a non-based alcohol covering (which also called basic alcohol, antiseptic arms, or handservice) started to be known.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that are formed together with anticorps such as carbomer (akrilate polymer) become gel or with humetan such as glucerin to be a throat or a bus to easily use and to reduce the effects of degradation from alcohol.
Increasing antimicrobial activity is an energetic peroxide evacuation. The service of hands containing at least 60-95% of alcohol is an efficient murderer.
Building alcohol kills bacteria, bacteria holding against many medicines (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSVs, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis).
Alcohol service 70% of alcohol killed 99.97% (log 3.5, compared to 35 decibles) bacteria in 30 seconds after infusion and 99.99% up to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in 1 minute after the visibility.
The basic alcoholic service is not effective against the type norwegian virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for gastrointestinal gastrointestinal gastrointestinal.
Forward and back two hands and on all of them and the end of all the rings are covered about 30 seconds until the wheel, the busy, or the warm gel.
The bridge must also be cut well by cutting it in two hands. The UK control and the illness of illness are more recommended by the hands of the hands of the hands, especially when the hands appear to be covered.
Increasing the use of the service agents because of the rapid use and the activity of killing against microchemes; but the service agency should not be used as the right hand-copper, except the water and the water is not available.
The use of basic alcoholic hands may often cause warm skin, unless emotions and/or skin benefits are placed in the formula.
Effect of alcohol can be reduced or lost by putting glucerin and/or other emotions into the formula.
In clinical trials, the basic alcoholic proclaimation that affects emotion causes irritation and hair violence much less than antimicrobial detergents.
Dermatitis of allergic contacts, urticaria syndrome of contacts, or hypersensitivity against alcohol or additive seeds in alcohol in hands often occurred.
The lower incidence causes the dermatitis of the contacts that are disturbing this product as well as the water - and - lamps of the hands.
Although effective, the non-air agent doesn't clear his hands from the organic rain, but only disinfect it.
Because of this reason, the hands are not effective in the avoiding the preaching of many patogens because the patogens are still in their hands.
The honour of free alcoholic preservation is very dependent on its rain and formulation, and the history indicates that this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol.
Recently, the formulation that uses chloride benzalconium has continued and simulated antimicrobial activity after implantation, not as alcohol, which evidence has been reduced after reuse, perhaps because of progressive sam-effect.
Many people in the low community are unable to purchase and use a cup or a land as a dairy.
Earth or earth may be more effective than only water, but I have more efficient than weapons.
One of the concerns is, if they are contaminated with microemes, lands or age may increase the disease preliminary to reduce it.
Like a wheat, it is also desinfektion agents because, if you contact with water, you will be able to deal with alcohol.
WHO comments on the wheel and the feast as an alternative to the wheat when the wheat is not available.
The technique to cut the right hands based on the recommendation of the United States Sickness Management Centre for the Disturbance of the diseases includes the following steps:
Basahi’s hands with warm water or cold.
The water is recommended because it may be contaminated by the bascon, but the water stream seems to be uninfluent.
Take your hands with it with a lot of bottles, including the hands, in all the wheel, and under me.
Sabun puts the skin of the skin, and the study shows that the people whose hands are cut more accurately when using the wheel instead of using only water.
Gosok's at least 20 seconds.
Increasing creatures, helping to lose the skin of the skin, and so longer weeping, we have lost more honeys.
The road is just under the water running.
Shooting in the basket can make the hands back contaminated.
Put it up with a thick lap or let it go in the air.
The low hands and lamps are easierly contaminated again. The region is often the jampool, the hands, the area between the wheel and under my wheel.
I have a building and my backed cat can save microchemes.
Losions often are recommended to ensure that hands are not covered; thirsty skin can cause hair disorder that can increase the risk of infection.
A number of low payment options can be made to fascinate the hands when water is not available, for example, broke water from grass or bottles that are cut down, and/or use it, if needed, in the developing country. In the case of the low waters (score school or areas in the developing country), there is a refrigerated water solution, such as "typepy-stap", and a remote choice.
The tippy rubber is a simple use of the water bottle broken with the woods, the wind operated by the feet to get a little water into the hands, and a lot of bullets.
Effective hands are the important part of the cleaning process, but there are negotiations on the most effective type of hand-influence on the general toilet.
More research shows that the card layer is far more clean than the sticking of the hands found on many toilets.
In 2008, a study of the University of Westminster, London, and available by the European Tisue Symposium Card Industries, to compare the higher levels of cleaning of the card, heavy aircraft, and more moder air brains.
Once heavy air streams and hands were cut off, the total number of bacteria were found increasing the rate of 194% in my books and 254% in my hands.
Increasing with the jet aircraft causes the total number of bacteria at 42% in my libraries and 15% in your hands.
Once you cut and cut your hands with a card layer, the total number of bacteria reduced the rate of 76% in your books and 77% in your hands.It also conducted a study to determine the potential of syringe contamination on other toilet uses and the toilet environment results from all types of interaction methods.
Jet air travellers, quicking air from a unit with a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), able to cut microchemics from hands and units and potential to fire other toilet users and toilet environments to 2 meters away.
Heavy aircraft use produces microemes to 0.25 metres from the air.
In 2005, in the study conducted by TÜV Product and Environment, various methods of evaluation of hand-effects have been shown in the map.
The number of bacteria has been changed:
There are many hand-handing manufacturers, and handing has been compared to inflammation using the paper.
Many hands by using handservice tissues are alternative during the trip if there is no wood and water.
Basic alcoholic service must have at least 60% of alcohol.
The medical dilution was given long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found its effect (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic arrangements that set up back to remind the hospital workers to cut off their hands if they forget.
One study discovered that the rate of infectious infections was used by the use of the ship.
The medical rubber for a minimum of 15 seconds, using many or gels of water in the number of hands, to rubber and rubber the hands.
The hands must be thrown on one another with one another.
If there's a cow under me, the bottle can be used to lose it.
Because the stone can stand in the waters that are in the hands, the hands need to be cut closely and cut down with clean layer.
Once a wheel, the cartridge is used to switch water (and open the door out if needed).
This action prevents the recontamination of the hands of that inflammation.
The purpose of cutting the hands in health care is to lose the microeme of patogen ("master") and avoid its relief.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that it is at least cut off its hands on a rate that is not able to be accepted in most of the medical environment, with a large number of doctors and doctors continue to stuck their hands before he touched the patient so that the microemes may be cut off.
One study shows that the screening of the right hands and other simple processes can reduce the level of blood infections of cateter blood to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has issued a delay that shows the standards of hands and hands in the health care sector.
The WHO-hand cleaning concepts can also be viewed on its web site for public comments.
Reported in Whitby et al.
Commercial warfare can reduce and validate the cleanness of hands if it is necessary to demonstrate the need for devotion to the rules.
World Health Organization has "Fem time" to cut hands:
after he was thrown into blood/bodies
before an aseptic task, and
After patients. The anti-septic chemical disorders in the wheel (sabats) or "antimicroba) functioned by killing the hand-cooked bowls.
The function of killing may be wanted before doing a low or in a ship when an antibiotic body holds very lazy. For 'building' the hands before the low operation, it is needed for a wheel that can be performed and without touching, clorhexid or iodium, sterile throat to stumble hands after it was cut off, and steril lowness to cover and other sterile instruments to clean under me.
All the deficiencies have to be released.
This process has been warranted by cutting hands and hands down to the stake, usually 2-6 minutes.
No long time (10 minutes) is required.
When the water is thrown, it must be broken down in the hand so that it doesn’t go back to the hand.
After finishing the hands, the hands are cut with a sterile cup, and the low clothes are covered.
In order to reduce the preaching work, it is better to cut off your hands or to use your hands before and after treatment of sick ones.
For the control of stafilococus infections in the hospital, it was found that the biggest benefit of cleaning hands was from 20% of the first exhibition, and that the benefits of a very few benefits were reduced when the frequency of hands was reduced over 35%.
Increasing infection diseases are more than three times increasing, compared with anti-bactery boxes. A comparison between throwing hands with basic alcohol and cutting hands with anti-bactery boxes with a medium every 30 seconds shows that the basic alcohol embrace reduces the contamination of the bacteria 26% more than anti-bacteria.
However, water and honey are more effective than basic alcohol-handed to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium spores from hands. Interventions to increase the health care of the health care can enlarge a staff’s training on screening hands, increase the basic alcohol braceles, and the written reminders and layout to the staff.
More studies are needed to know the most effective interventions of health care.
In the developing country, he cut his hands with a cup as a basic way to gain good health and even good nutrition.
However, it is less than the waters that can be controlled, the hole, or the weakness of the hands in the homes, schools, and the workplace makes it possible to reach the universel behaviour of the hands of a challenge.
For example, in most areas of Africa’s village, the hands in the nearest toilet or toilet are often available, although the option is available to make a worm of hands.
Likewise, the low rate of hands can also occur because of the habits that have been broken and not because of less water or honey.
Dorongans and anxieties can influence the moral decisions, enhance the knowledge of the benefits of the cup of hands, and make changes in the behaviour of the long population.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation needs.
The systemic attitude towards 70 studies found that the basic community approach is increasing the LMIC hand-country, while the social marketing campaign is more efficient. One example of the school hand-cooking is "Tree Bintang" by UNICEF who encourages the school to take simple and swimming steps to stumble the students' hands with a bottle, among other freedoms.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to three stars.
The building of the hand-cotch can be a part of the campaign of hand-coppers in order to reduce the sickness and children’s death.
The Day of Deduction of the World Hand is another campaign of science that tries to achieve the purpose of the change of behaviour. According to the coronavirus 2019-2020, UNICEF prevented the emotions of the hand.
Some studies investigate payment efficiency by cutting the hands in the countries developed in their ambition with disability-adjusted Live Year (DALY) or a lost year of disease.
One event shows that to prevent the hands with a significantly significant hair of the payment of water interventions and other health.
It is important to cut the hands for human health, especially for people in a rental situation, such as a newborn mother or a wounded soldier in the hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hand-free reports: Dr. Hungarian Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Wina, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "moderal actor" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infections are caused by a thief tree called mysma or bad air.
In the 1980 ’ s, the infections that were reported through health care and infection made the Central Control and the American Medical Sickness more actively affected the cleaning of hands as an important way to prevent infection prevention.
In 2009, the floor floor wave and the COVID-19 pandemics in 2020 increased the conscience in many countries would be important to cut hands with a bottle to protect themselves from that disease.
For example, the poster "technology cut up the right hand" was thrown at the bottom of the public toilet and at the toilet of the office and aircraft in Germany.
When "building hands from" something means to tell someone's responsibility to be responsible or to be involved in something.
The Bible chapter of Matthew’s book was found when Pontius Pilate was cut off his hands on the decision to deal with Jesus Christ, but it became an outstanding evidence in the English community.
In the work of Shakespeare, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to steal his hands and continue to cleanse the imaginary node; it shows that he feels innocent for the evil he did and because he has made her husband to do it.
It has also been known that when we remember or meditate on non - ethical actions, people often swallow their hands and are more appreciated by the hardware to cut off their hands.
Moreover, those who have been allowed to cut off their hands after that thinking have a smaller possibility to be involved in the "pure" action, like to become pleasant.
The religion commands hands for purification and symbolic purposes. The symbolic broken hands, which uses water, but without water, is a part of the ritual to cut off the hands in many religions, including the faith of Bahai, Hindu, lives and isolations in the Jewish, Lavabo in the Christian, and Wudhu in the Islam. The religion also commands the destruction of the hands for the purification, as well as after certain works.
Hindu, Jewish, and Islam were forced to take hands after using a toilet.
Moreover, Hindu, Buddha, Sikh, Jewish, and Islam were forced to eat their hands before and after them.
Workspace management for COVID-19
The COVID-19 workshop manager is the survey of safety and health methodology for the monitoring of the disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The right control of the workplace depends on the jobs and jobs, based on the market source risk control, the rate of illness in society, and the risk factor of each employee that may be acquired of COVID-19.
According to the Security and Health of the United States (OSHA), low market risk work has a minimum contact with the public and other fellow workers; for this work, it is designed to prevent basic infections, which cover their hands, encourage workers to live in the house if sickness, ethics, and make cleaning and infection of the work environment.
Risco work is covering work that requires a close contact or often with someone who is unknown or who is required to call COVID-19, but may be infected because of the income in society that is running or international journey.
It includes workers who have contact with public society such as in school, work environments with high population attacks, and high volume rates.
In addition to the basic infection prevention steps, the control of the high efficiency air, the protection against the railway, and the defense tools when meeting COVID-19.
OSHA takes care of health enemies and rooms that are dedicated to those who are known or are required to call COVID-19 to high risks, which increases the risk of a very high market if the worker makes a successful process on, or takes or handles the species of those who are known or are required to call COVID-19.
The proper control for this worker includes technical controls, such as negative ventilation rooms, and self - protection tools that are suitable to work.
COVID-19 can have some effects on the workplace.
A worker may not come to work because of sickness, need to care for others, or fear of the potential of the land.
The business pole can change, well in the kind of things requested and in the way to get these things (which is the outside of the employment hour, by the faith, or the design).
Finally, the COVID-19-19-speaking of the very seen geografic areas can be distorted. The diagnosis and plans of infection disease can be used to conduct protection action.
The plan considers the dangerous risk size of various jobs and jobs, includes market sources, risk factors resulting from home and society, and risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also envisages the need to control the risks and the adjustment plans that may be caused as a result.
The subjection and the plans of illness may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the destruction are to reduce the exit between staff, to protect those who are higher in the risk of harder health complication, to maintain business operations, and to minimize bad effects on the other entity in the ship.
The rate of sickness in a community where businesses are affected by the injuries taken.
The survival of the labour is a degree of work that is used in the safety and health of the work in order to deal with the low controls based on its effects.
If COVID-19 is not able to be lost, the most effective control is technical control, the administrative control is followed, and the last self-defense tool.
Technical controls are able to isolate workers from the harmless workers without depending on the worker’s conduct and can be the most valuable solution to apply.
Administrative administration is a change in the rules or process of work that need work or work.
Self-defense tools (APD) are considered effectively compared to technical and administrative controls, but can help to avoid parts of the market.
All types of APD must be chosen on the basis of workers, being elected correctly as it is (e.g., respirator), accepted consistently and rightly, tested, checked, concerned, and waste, cleaned, and saved correctly or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Health and Work Health (OSHA), the low farming work has a minimum contact with the public and other workers.
The stages of the main infection prevented for all workplaces are often cut off the hands closely, encouraging the workers to live in the house if sickness, the ethics cover the hiding of the rocks and the skin, preparing the network and the wallets, preparing the work from the remote road or laying work with the time of the income/profession, if necessary, members of the worker to not use any other tools, and doing cleanness and infection in the work environment in a routine.
The quick and isolation of potential individuals is a important step in protecting workers, employers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Government and Sickness Centre (CDC) recommends that workers who have an accurate injury disease have to live in their home until they are free of the pain, the signs of silence, and other signs for at least 24 hours without using the drugs of the disorder or other pharmaceutical changes, and that the practice of the disease is flexible to allow the employees to live in the house to care for a diseased family, and that the workers may understand this practice.
According to OSHA, the OSHA risk work is involved in work that requires a contact in close or often in six feet rates (1.8 meters) with someone who is not known or who is required to call COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the public's entertainment around business, or because someone's new journeys to the locality with a major COVID-19.
This includes workers with contact with the public society such as in school, work environments with high population and high volume rates. Technical controls and high risk operators have a high efficiency filter, enhanced the intensity of the workers, enhanced physically as the plastics of the guardians, and inserted the drivers or the laptop windows for the service. Administrative management for this hole and high risk-country is a high risk to put a high air filter, enhanced the rate of the painful workers to live in the house, enhanced the conference with the communization, and enhanced its workshops, and enhanced its ensuring/profession, and restructured by the Crafting of the Crafting and the Office of the Employment of the Officers.
A worker in this risk box often needs a respirator.
If someone falls sick in the aircraft, the right control to protect the workers and other employees is to separate those who are sick from another with 6 feet, a cabin guard to care for the sick, and offers a face mask for the sick or asks him to shut the mouth and heat with the tissue when the throat or the tissue.
The cabins have to stumble with a medical hand at a time when they care for a sick or to touch the body's throat or the potential that can be contaminated and may be protected by others if a sick tissue suffers calamity, continuous rocks, or difficulties to disappear.
One hand and one of the other vessels must be removed in the ships, and the contaminated inflammation must be cleaned and disinfekted after it. For commercial studies, including fishing ships and other ships, the ships of the ships are able to travel if disease, isolate themselves, and inform medical centres on the ship soon if someone experiences the ships or other signs when they are on the ship.
Ideally, further medical action in the cabinet of people isolated, unless the public ministry, the school and the unfortunateness of children, the CDC recommends that the infections of those who have been in the school building are cleaned or disinfekted.
If there is a public outcome at the minimum level until there is, social responsibilities strategy can be applied, which includes: cancel visits of money, meetings and other large assemblies, such as natural education, sound class, or eating in the cafeteria, increase the time between tables, time of income and inhabitants, dismissing visits, and use a local health office separated for children with a fluid box.
If there is a high outcome in the local community, in the framework of social responsibilities strategy, it can be considered to extend school secrets. For a legal employee who is working on a daily routine activity, the risk of health is low by the CDC.
Legal deputy officers who have to contact those who are confined or covered by COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same medical technology, including using suitable self-defense tools.
If a close contact occurs during the arrival, the workers must clean and disinfekte the jobs before re-using by using the middle or ladder of the house and follow the standard operations to control and remove the APD file and to control and cut the cottor clothing.
OSHA considers the healthy hosts and the rooms of certain mediums are in a high or very high risk category.
High-marketing work includes health care, support, ethics, and medical transport engines that are supported with known or COVID-19 patients.
This work becomes a very high risk of the market if the employee makes a successful process on, or takes or handles the species of the patients known or COVID-19.
The process of achievement is intuition, induction processing, bronchoscope, some processing and disorders, or invasive invasion.
The workshops are highly risked by the workers who are involved in preparing a person who knows or is given COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes a very high place if the worker makes autopsy. This technic control includes a isolation room for patients known or exposed to COVID-19, when the process is achieved in the architecture.
Specific negative pressure may be used in some health and medical surveys.
Specimen need to be handled with the deficiencies of the level of bioscape 3.
World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to be separated into a different waiting room based on the case of COVID-19. Besides the APD, OSHA recommends the respirator for those who work within 6 feet of patients who are known or who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who make a successful process.
In the United States, the NIOSH, or the best of the NIOSH, respirator has to be used in the context of the written and comprehensive system of protection, which includes the appropriate, training and medical tests.
Other types of respirator can give greater protection and increase workers' security. WHO doesn't recommend the shutdown of it or coverall because the COVID-19 is a disease of disturbance and isn't exposed through the body.
The WHO only recommends the hard mask for the cross-border workers in the area.
For those who take the species of discharge, care, or disturb COVID-19 patients without successful processes, the WHO recommends the maskers, protectors, or the roads, clothes, and hands.
If the process is successful, the mask is expired with N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Remember that the APD soldiers do not have enough over the world, the WHO recommends minimize the needs of APD through a remote doctoral service, physically like the screen window, with only those involved in direct appeal can enter the COVID-19 patients' room, using only APDs needed for certain tasks, continue to use the same respirator without avoiding it when careing for many patients with the same diagnosis, intermediately and coordinating the APD arms, and not stimulating the use of a mask for people without a traveling.

BARYEK: [Covid-19] Prepare and prepare the future.
COUNCIL/WAKE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISENSI: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in this month’s undeserved kindness.
Epidemi COVID-19 is something that makes us clear to the global human gratitude and the responsibilities we have.
We have never experienced its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the form of four, the same work, and the building of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and anxiety that we have been just among all the workers through email, calling, and obrole is a strange validation, there are strange people, which we have enough lucky to work with them.
Thank you and my fierceness can't even call you as a worker.
Someone shared with me their appreciation for our work last week.
They reminded me how much it means for the world today to enhance Wikipedia, and how powerful it is for these important sources to remain ready for everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, and you know that this is still a way, help us pay our fellow believers, or help us to keep our community security.
The world needs information available for Wikipedia, especially now.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it will make an impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important advice on how we work together, which will begin the next week.
Obedience to our works and works
As the Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our neighborhood and building for a few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the right response for the challenges we face and the best way to keep the organization’s responsibilities today.
We really want to lose pressure and support our mission for a long time.
If you need to reduce the work building, it's okay.
For all staff, contractor and contract workers:
Our day - day hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further knowledge.
We don't set free day, if you can work more at normal hour, this mission needs you.
However, the world can not be preached now, and you need to take care of the loved ones, pay the needs of the post, or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We don't have your work time.
If you are sick, don't work.
This should not be said, but we said it.
No pain or PTO is needed, you can tell your manager and your team to review your calendar and building for the main work environments that can be disabled.
(If you are diagnosed positively to call COVID-19, you hope to tell Bryan in T&C Ops that T&C can help with support and support you get proper attention from manager).
The companions of his payment are based on the time will be paid full.
We have told it, and again, to honor our committee to the contractors and staff based on hours.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their work hours usually when normal conditions are.
This includes if you are sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to stress the world around us.
The work we're doing can take a lot of pleasure, especially in times like this.
Once again, the most important thing is to care for yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what you have to anticipate and can take the right action.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some jobs that have to keep traveling.
SRE, SDM operations, confidence and security, and Danefall team, inter alia, do important works that may need support.
We will start processing with all the departments to fulfill the objectives now and focus our assignment to support the essential things for our mission.
There are many things to be for us all, we will only focus on the most important projects.
Late now, nothing will be for the future.
We're not planning to "smooth work to lose the loss" after this pandemy passed.
You will not be expected to work quietly in order to take up an unrealistic period of time.
We realized that it changed and would try to set the targets and the new time line if necessary.
What about APP?
To repeat with new realities and expected work hours, we intended to set up the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2012 Science Plan.
We mean to carry out the 2019-2020 schedule that allows more time to make an advice so that workers can prioritize an important job, self-sufficiency, and the dear people's advice by communicating those needed or wanting to work with the building less than a few weeks ago.
The length of the timeline is very reduced by the workshops and the pressure of the current plans in the entire organization.
We will keep our proposal to the next week and prepare delegations and teams on the next step soon after we got confiscated.
Thank you for the APP team for your career in this matter.
Status, boards, and office divisions
The week ago, we were given to know that one of our partners based on SF may have been a COVID-19 virus.
However, because we were very concerned about the antivirus cross to disinfekte all the infections in the Office of San Francisco.
They use an antivirus call from the hospital to defeat the infections of the inflammation, the lobby, and all the lifts that endanger us.
The builder applies his own security protocol using the product that supports its security.
We feel happy that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the staff members based in the DC.
Since a week ago, our DC office has moved to a remote workplace, with a shared board with San Francisco.
As known by some of our partners based in NYC, we are also discussing the location in Brooklyn.
This debate continues, but maybe it will be hidden.
For the first time, some of our companions work from a distance.
Our fellow believers who have long worked long ago realized that this might be needed to obey and they want to advise you:
The latest one or two hours of duration.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Definition is clear, create a calendar, and send a previous record.
Make videos as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and direct connection.
Master’s right to fascinate, a person’s response to questioning and recording, and a person’s help to make a record (or to make a co-operative record).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your health care to buy small places.
Connect to the #remoties in Slack to talk to a companion about a shared job
The SDM Operation Team is looking for a web-based engine-based engine to support the workshops distributed throughout the Yayasan.
This week later, we requested all Community receipters and changes to cancel the public appeal based on Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO states that the pandemi has been ended.
We reported to them that we understand our requests for reporting and other replies can make them unable to fulfill the accepted changed activities and that no one will be given to the penalty because they have to determine or modify the schedule.
This week, we will be able to share with a major role on Wikimania and the regional community and other communities conferences.
Generally, the sensation of the global community appears to be the simplicity of this disturbance, but even the clearness and ability to focus on its own community, well as Wikimedia and others.
Forward, the CRT is trying to prepare the Meta-Wiki pages to fix a room for the community to focus and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected while COVID-19
We'll send your invitation to your calendar to Kamis, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for special staff.
We will use this time to share a number of questions, answer your questions, and take time to connect each other.
We're really in this area and we want to help all of us.
During that time, you can continue to get information from this email and all the more important information of the COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to store this page and keep all information on one place.
We also tried to keep routine communication with a staff living in countries that are currently significant.
If you have questions about traveling, appealing, main work tools, or difficulties about lifting, or other things that may need help, do not be sure that you can meet and work together with the CRT.
We were here to help support and to become a closer in the needs.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send email to Brian Judan, Global SDM Operation Director.
No such changes are viewed as our work and our obligations.
Instead, this change is a challenge that, now, our work and our obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are the steps that we must be important to support each other in this area so that we can continue to work, simplify the support we need to move, and member the world of their service.
The work we planned before will be there to wait for us when the time comes.
For now, this is the time to support each other and create a room for important work that will come within a few weeks and maybe a few months ago.
We need you all to make it, for that, we want you to care for yourself and your family so that you can work well when you need it.
Finally, please cut your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and other commitments (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jaime V, Jaene U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Enzim of the change of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is located on the outer cell (memberan cells) in the powder, artery, heart, ginjal, and gémise.
ACE2 has an activity against angiotensin enzyme (ACE), reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increased angiotensin (1-7), thus make it a target that promises to treat cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also works as a point in the cell for some coronavirus.
ACE2 human version is often called hACE2.
The enzyme of angiotensine oversight 2 is the metaloenzym of the endote and other cells.
ACE2 protein has M2 peptidase terminal-N and transporter domain of amino renal collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is the protein of the type I-motional cross-border, with an enzyme-active domain on the cells in the puzzle and other networks.
ACE2’s extraordinary domain is separated from transmembran domain by other enzymes, known as sheddase, and the above protein resulted in the blood allocation and finally diescreen in the urin.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 is located on the primary cells of the alveolary cells of type II, small enterocytes, artery endote cells and vena, and the cells of artery pollen in most organs.
ACE2’s expression was also found in the cerebral card, striatum, hypotalamus, and brains.
The main ACE2 function is ACE-productor.
ACE divided an angiotensin I hormone to angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 broke carboxin phenylanain asylum of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysed it to an angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide other persons with [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grain.
ACE2 also sets the aircraft of the SLC6A19 netherlands and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As transmembran protein, ACE2 works as a primary point in the cell for some coronavirus, which includes HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus caused by SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus caused by COVID-19).
More specific, the S1 protein in the SRS-CoV spike or tonjolation and SARS-CoV2 with an enzyme domain of ACE2 in the cell endositosis and translocation of virus and enzyme in the endosome contained in the cell.
This virus process also needs primary protein S by TMPRSS2 protease serin which is currently investigated as potential therapy. This makes people hypothesis that the ACE2 in the cell can help combat infections.
However, many professional societys and regulations are recommended to continue therapy with ACE and ARB standard inhibitors.
A systematic and meta-analysis operation, published on 11 July 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitor causes a meaning of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Moreover, "the use of ACE inhibitor also caused pneumonia risks to patients with higher risk for pneumonia, the maintenance of stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitor is also threatened with the deteriorated mortality of pneumonia, although the results are less powerful than the risk of the exhaust pneumonia."
ACE2 human recombinance (rhACE2) is expected to be a new terapie for acute chemotherapy, and seems to increase pharmaceutical hemodinamics and oxygen saturation in children with acute inhibited by lipopolisacaride.
The time of rhACE2 on humans is about 10 hours with 30 minutes alongside its length of 24 hours.
Some occurrences indicate that rhACE2 may be a medicine promised for patients with intolerance against classic renin-angiotensin inhibitor (RAS-inhibitor) or with angiotensin II disease in increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical tests for a acute treatment syndrome.
b'COVID-19 application is the application of the COVID-19-based mobile ships designed to assist contact detection of the coronavirus 2019-2020, which is the process of identifying people ("contakt") which may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications are developed or designed, which provide government support in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some jobs have been developed to build the contact discovery application.
The issue of the privacy is being questioned, and it is overwhelmed by the system based on the logical location of the user’s application.
The alternative that is not too important to the privacy is the use of Bluetooth signals to record user approaches with other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth basic application directly in the Android and iOS operation system.
In Tiongkok, the Government of Tiongkok, together with Alipay, has provided applications that allow citizens to check if they have contacted COVID-19.
This application was used in more than 200 cities in Tiongkok. In Singapore, the application named TraceTogether was used.
This application is developed by local TI communities, written as open source and delivered to governments. Northern Macedonia decreased "StopKorona!", a basic Bluetooth application to deal with people who are infected and give a quick response to health care authorities.
This application is developed by the Communication, Technology and Health Ministry.
By 14 April 2020, the application still waited for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store agreement.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the application of contact discovery was in progress and will be available for a few weeks. The same application was scheduled in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
The New Zealand and the New Zealand are based on the TraceTogether Singapura application and BlueTrace Protocol. Russia was intended to report the geofencing application for COVID-19 patients living in Moskow; this application was designed to replace and they did not leave home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Technology at the University of Cambridge, refers to a number of practical problems that may occur on the basic application system, which includes false positive and probably less efficiency if data that are taken limited to a small part of the population.
To overcome anxiety about the "coronavirus" predictation that is increasing or dangerous, Apple sets a border on a type of organization that can enable the most dangerous application of the coronavirus application to App Store, which is only for the "resmi" organization or which has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon have applied the same question.
Private supporters understood their concerns about the implication of mass survey using coronavirus applications, especially on whether the survey infrastructure made to handle the coronavir pandemics will be stopped after the threat occurred.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have exposed the limits of such survey.
This organization states eight conditions in the government project:
the supervision must "conform to law, need, and proportional";
The rate of survey and survey must have the sun's ear;
data use must be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
security and anonymity of data must be protected and proved to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital survey must avoid more discrimination and marginalisation;
The data collection with the third person must be defined in the invitations;
There must be protection against the consumption and the rights of the citizens of the country to repay use;
Participants mean all my "relevant interests" needed, which includes social health and term-arguments. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) German and Reporters Withoutout Borders (Reporter without limits) (RSF) also extract the check record.
The Google/Øe plan proposed intends to resolve the survey problem continues with the elimination of the mechanisms of the transmission from the system of civil operations after it is not needed again.
Some countries use network based locations, not applications, so they have lost the need to invite applications and ability to avoid discovery.
In Israel, the basic networks are accepted.
Based network solutions that have access to local data have significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems with the central server need to authenticate personal local data; a number of systems that protect the privacy have been created and used the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, non - basic application systems are used to make contact reviews.
As a result of special applications, the system collects information from various sources, includes data on the broadcasts and card transactions, and connects this information to providing information through the text message to those who are infected.
In addition to using this information to warn the potential contact, the government also makes the local information available for the general, which has been allowed with significant changes to the private invitations of information after the MERS in that country.
This information is available for the public through a number of applications and web daemons. German countries such as Germany are considered to use the system once to protect the privacy.
By 6 April 2020, the details are not written yet.
The contacts protecting the privacy are already maped, with a large number of studies started since at least in 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a thousand of phones worked a large private solution, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's closeness with other phones.
However, the PP-PT is an effort to coordinate the centralization and decentralising approach, not a single protocol. The centralization protocol includes the approach to protect the Terdecentralisation Privacy Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Time Contact Number (TCN), before the name of the Contact Event Number, CEN, Protocol and Privacy Sensitive Mechanism for the Dealing of Celular Contacts (PACT), and other.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified have never left the ships, and all the consequences occur in the ships.
Privacy group in the MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, platforms to use privacy technology when collecting and using the local or tool intersection data to find the COVID-19 preliminary.
This is based on the "Apps Gone Rogue: Contenting Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" studies written in March 2020.The same is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, which develops privacy and is also set up in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses a safe hardship to allow users to share local and sensitive health data with other users and workers without offering the data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was addressed by the CNS coalitions which are based on the same approach and are the same protocols, with a view to reducing fragmentation and enable global interoperability for applications of discovery and warning, which are the main aspect of achievement of major receipts.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapura Government announced that they had made BlueTrace protocols used by its Government's government to be open sources.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the initiative for contacts, which they claimed to protect the privacy, based on the Bluetooth Low Energy combination and cryptography that protects the privacy.
They also mobilize the specifications of the key used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be destroyed in three steps:
a tool to enable governments to create the original application of coronavirus that protects the privacy
This function integration directly to the iOS and Android Google and Apple planned to resolve the problem of data and surveying continues to be distributed by the system through the operational system, and then remove it in the same way after the threat occurs.
b'Reposition of the medicine (including new purposes, new profile, or new tasks on medicines or therapy) is the use of the medicinal product which has been approved for new treatment purposes, as well as for diseases or medical conditions that are different to the initial development of the medicine.
This is the way of scientific investigation that is currently in place to develop safe and effective treatment of COVID-19.
Another research guide includes the development of COVID-19 vaxin and convalesen plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 proteins that can be metabolised, each protein has a number of lips.
Analysis on the sides of the ligue can be based on an effective antivirus drug development project against protein COVID-19.
Some of the most important proteins of SARS-CoV-2 targets are proteases like papaine, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helikase, proteins S, and ADP ribofosfatase.

Chlorokuin is an antimalary medicine that is also used against some autoimmunal diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chlorocuine and the fearful chlorocuine were two of the four medicines that would be treated as part of the clinical trial of Solidarity.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Chomme, announced that the tests of clorokuin and chlorocuine in New York will be started on 24 March. On March 28, the FDA authorised the use of sulphate oxychlorocuine and phosphate chlorocuine based on the Darurat Usage Authorisation (USA).
This treatment is not yet approved by the FDA clinical test process and the authorization based on the US only as a experimental treatment for use of the disease in patients concerned, but cannot accept treatment in clinical trials.
CDC says "usage, dose, or duration of oxychlorocuine for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections" has not yet been established.
The doctor said they used that medicine when "no other choice".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting small studies on the use of chlorocuine combined with lens, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
The big one is running in Duke and Oxford.
NEW Langone Medical School is testing the safety and use of preventive oxychlorocuine.

WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
Gilead Sciences was created and developed as treatment for Ebola virus diseases and Marburg virus infections. Then, Gilead Sciences found that it had antivirus activity in vitro against some philosophy, pneum-, paramics-, and coronavirus.
One problem with antivirus treatment is the occurrence of resistence through mutation that can cause a more harder disease and transmission.
Some early test studies show the remdesivir may have high genetical responsibilities against resistence. There are some clinical tests that are running, along with two clinical tests in the University of Cleveland, one for people who are sick and another for the sick.
There are three clinical tests that are running for intravenous C vitamins for people who are concerned with anxiety and COVID-19 pain, including two controlled placebos (Tiongkok, Canada) and one without control (Italia).
The New York Bagian country started testing for azitromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.

A multipathy study of 300 patients investigated the use of enoxaparin sodium in the profilaxis and apetic dose was reported in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many scientific attention is focused to meet the new treatment objectives to antivirus medicines which are agreed and developed for previously, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Tiongkok edition 7
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Tiongkok edition-7
Some antibiotics identified as potential medicines that can be given new purposes for treatment with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor IL-6): Accepted by Tiongkok.
Moreover, testing also in Italy and Tiongkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'Vaksin COVID-19 is hypotetic vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine that has completed clinical tests, there are many efforts to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to the WHO, vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, this illness virus will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in the Fase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Great crowds were divided into the world in 2020, which caused investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the means that is published to develop vaccines that may be against SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that what was to be advised in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, preaching at the needed scale, and global access.
In April, the CEPI reported that 10 different platforms are in investigation and development during the beginning of 2020 to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform target for Fase I security studies, addressed:
Nuclear asylum (DNA and RNA) (fase I development and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Vektor virus (Fase I pending and candidate vaccine: CanSino Bioologys, Vektor adenovirus type 5)
As reported by the CEPI scientist in April, the total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early development, with 78 were constructed as a active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 other were notified, but with a few available public information (continued to be planned or designed).
The I-II Phase test testing the first safety and immunogenity tests, usually in low, placebo control, and in some places, by determining the correcter effective dose.
Fase III tests usually interfere with more advertisers, including controllers, and test vaccine efficiency to prevent illness, by counting the same effect on optimal dose.
From 79 vaccine candidates developed (contributed at beginning April 2020), 74 of them were not yet in human evaluation (including "practic investigation").
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of molecular vaccines that would genetically modify virus protein to reduce immune reactions.

The Guardian reported that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, has offered "a large number of money" for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaxin" to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced mythration with the German company, BioNTech, for together to develop based MRNA vaccine.
At this time, MRNA, BNT162, a vaccine candidate is in practice study with clinical tests will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian Biotech Biotech biotech announced that they would receive the results of the practice study in April 2020, and the vaccine candidate at the end can be tested on humans at the morning.
On March 19, 2020 in France, Epidemic Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced a large US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaxin Research Consortium, which included the Institute Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Wine, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with the total investment of the COVID-19 COVID in the development of COVID-19.
Other ECPI investments for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russia’s health officer announced that scientists have started six vaccine candidates in animals.
The Imperial College Research of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing RNA vaccine that could expand themselves for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after receiving an event from Tiongkok.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced a number of C$275 million for 96 medical investigations against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at the company and the Canadian University, such as Medicago initiative and Saskatchewan University.
At the same time, the Canadian Government announced a total of C$192 million specially to develop COVID-19 vaccine, with a plan to set up national vaxin banks, some new vaccines that can be used if another coronavirus is happening.
On April 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh reported PittCoVacc, COVID-19 Vaxin candidate on the tissue; they said that "MNA that gives S1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has a potential anti-geneal response [in the tissue] starting two weeks after the immunisation."
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the Farms faculty of the Waterloo University announced the DNA based vaccine candidate as a potential nature.
By using bacteria, DNA was designed to implement in human bacteria to produce particulate particulates like a dangerous virus, which could include immune systems to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, governments, industries, and three United States universities collected sources for IBM supercomputers, combined with the sources of the cloud computation from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a heaterological effect, which is also called non-equivalent effects.
It means that these vaccines can benefit outside the insufficient disease.
The following trial tests are trying to follow 4 170 health officers.
There are probably no safe or effective vaccines in the development.
The initial investigation to monitor vaccines using specific animal models COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic, other animals, and non-human primates, shows the need for steps to reach biological security level 3 in the maintenance of life-virus, and international coordination for the standard safety process.
Vaxin against SARS and MERS has been tested on non-human animal models.
By 2020, there are no medicines or protection vaccines for SARS that prove to be safe and effective for humans.
According to the study published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new medicines to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health throughout the world.
When MERS become prevalent, the SARS studies that have been identified may be used to develop vaccine and therapy against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (based DNA) which completed the phase I clinical tests for humans, and three other vaccines are in process, which all are a virus-vector vaccine, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-Vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts include the theory of conspiration that claims virus at the back of COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccine has been available.
Patents that are covered by various social media posts decrease patents for genetic and vaccine for other coronavirus gallus, such as coronavirus SARS.
(COVID-19) b'Peacency of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe disease caused by coronavirus accurate 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The general signs were thrown down, rocks, and along.
Other signs can include weaknesses, nerves, diarrhoea, diarrhoea diseases, losses of wounds, and pain.
Since the magazine was packed to the general, about five days, but it could begin from two to fourteen days.
Although most of the cases have caused raw signals, some have developed a virus pneumonia and a failure of a mature organ.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial regions, which caused more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568.000 people have been healed, and this virus is most likely preaching to humans when a contact occurs, often through a small broadcast or a droppet that has been achieved through stones, rocks, or talks.
Though it has been done when it is released, the droppet is usually falling to the ground or to the surface, and it is not a long time.
People can also be infected by touching the confusions that have been contaminated and touching the eyes, the pain, or the mouth.
In the surface, this virus can stand for 72 hours.
This virus is very exposed for the first three days after the signature, although the predict may occur before the signal appears and after its next disease. The standard diagnosis method is with the reaction of the real-time polymerase transcripty range (rRT-PCR) in the case of non-sofaring.
The mask use is assigned to a person who has a virus and who cares about it.
Recommendation on the use of maskers by different communities; parts of the authorities recommend that they do not use the mask, some of their uses, and some of the other cause their uses.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antivirus treatment specific for COVID-19.
Local disease transmission has been recorded in nearly all countries in six WHO areas.
Some who are infected with a virus can be without signs or experience signs such as flu, such as throat, throat, disorder, and throat.
The signs of the treasure include the difficulties of distressing, dressing or throwing in the woods that continue to continue, distress, hardness, wake up, and faces or birds; the medical refugiation will soon be recommended if these signs appear.
The signs of the destruction, such as the wheat, the throat, or the pain of the injury, can be severe, but more often occur.
Gastrointestinal signs, such as wheat, whisper, and diarrhoea, are observed in a low percent.
Some cases in Tiongkok were only with clinical thoughts and palypitation.
In some cases, sickness can be a pneumonia, a disaster of organs, and death.
This problem is called inkubase time.
COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can begin from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who walk will experience a sign in 11,5 days of infection.
The original evidence shows that they may contribute to the illness preacher.
Currently, the proportion of infections that are not yet known and are being studied, with the Court of Agency and the Court’s Sickness (KCDC) reported that 20% of all cases were convergenced remaining without a sign during the hospital care.
The National Health Commission Tiongkok began to determine cases without signs in its case on 1 April; from 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show a sign at the study.
Sputums and waters can bring a virus in a large scale.
Speaking with the lowly leaves more discoveries or droplets than normally speaking.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered stone could cause droplets to be reduced to 4,5 metres long (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not translated through the air, the National Scientific Academy of America shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and the air collection placed outside the room of people produces a positive example for RNA virus.
Some medical processes, such as intubacy and intuition of the heart (RJP), can make secrets changed to the sun and then spread through the air.
Although there is anxiety that the virus can spread through the festivals, the risk is low.
The Center of the European Sickness and Management (ECDC) said that although it is not clear how easy this disease is to divorce, one generally infected two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on the carton/cartoon, until three days on plastic (polypropilene) and a cartridge (AISI 304), and to four hours in comparison with 99%.
Yet, it depends on the lack of disappointment and distress.
Snow and detergen are also effective if they are correctly used; the fat produces a virus protection lamp, deactivates virus, and releases it from the skin and other inflammations.
Otherwise, such as chloride benzalconium and gluconium chloride and chlorhexidine (deprecated infection), I am effective. In a study in Hong Kong, the chemistry of water was taken in the median two days after the start of the midnight.
In five of six patients, the first example shows the highest volume of virus, and six patients show the highest amount of virus in the second day study.
Coronavirus is the first time is isolated from three persons with painful pneumonia with a classer of acute disease in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 viruss are on the coronavirus that works in nature.
Outside the human body, this virus was killed by a houseboat, which destroyed its protective lifts. SARS-CoV-2 worked close to the first SARS-CoV.
Paru is the most emphasised organ of COVID-19 because the virus affects the cells through an angiotensin change enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most moved in the alveolar cell of type II parue.
This virus uses a special glucoprotein called "spike or tonjolan" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the cells.
The accurate heart ceder was found at 12% of the infections in the whiskey in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more frequently in the diseases of disorders.
High cardiovasculary signal level because there was a systemic inflammation response and immune system disorder during the development of the disease, but the acute microcard ceder may also be threatened by ACE2 receptor in the heart.
Receptor ACE2 diespress is very high in the heart and is involved in the heart function.
Incidence of trombosis (31%) and genetic tromboembolism (25%) found in COVID-19 infection patients and may be threatened with bad prognoses. Otopsy to those who died because COVID-19 found an alveolary disorder (DAD) and an inflammatic infiltrate that produces limfosis in the park.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the episode cell that expresses ACE2, COVID-19 patients have a systemic hyperinflames signal.
In particular, T cells, which recognised GM-CSF patogenic, proved to be co-related with monosite creation that includes IL-6 inflamators and patrol patology in COVID-19 patients.
Limfosic infiltrate has been reported at the autopsy.
WHO has mobilized several studies protocols for this disease.
The standard study method is the reaction of the polymerase transcriptase range in real-time (RRT-PCR).
This test is usually used in an example of an insofaring model; but it can also be used as a pattern of throat or sput.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
The blood test can be used, but it needs two blood samples taken by two weeks so that the results have a small value of time.
The Tiongkok scientists can isolate this coronaviral gallure and mobilise its genetic follow-up so that the whole world can develop the reaction studies of the polymerase (PCR) reactions to detect infections by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies tests (which can detect active infection and if someone has been infected before) are in developing, but are not much used.
The experience of Tiongkok with that study shows that it is only 60 to 70 per cent.
The FDA in the United States accepted the first point-of-care study on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of the month. The diagnosis recorded by the House of Zhongnan University Wuhan suggested a method to detect infections based on clinical and epidemiological risks.
The opacity of bilateral multiplayers with perifer distribution, asymmetrics, and later many were found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (seven bullums with alveolar adjustment) and consolidation can occur in the emergency of the disease.
A few data are available about microscopic transmission and COVID-19 patofisiology.
The foundation of the main patology of the authenticity is:
Macroscope: pleury, pericardity, consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of virus pneumonia can be observed:
low pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, big atypic pneumocyte, interstitial inflames with limfosic infiltration, and many parent cells
Hard pneumonia: difused alveolar difus (DAD) with alveolar exhaust.
DAD is the cause of the syndrome of acute sign (ARDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the medical level: exhausts in alveolar rows and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation diseminate (DIC); leucoetrobolic reaction
The steps of avoidance to reduce the potential of infection are staying in the house, avoiding many places, often cut off hands with wood and water for at least 20 seconds, imprisoning the hygiene of good disturbance, and avoiding touching the eyes, dishes, or mouths with unbridged hands.
CDC recommends to close the mouth and hide with the tissue when the tissue or the tissue is used and the use of the part in the tissue if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene’s hands were followed after the rock or the throat was given.
The CDC recommends that the use of the clusters in general, a part of the outcome of people without a signal. It is intended to reduce the contact of people infected with many people, in order to close school and job, to deal with the traveling, and to reject the large scale meetings in the general.
The questionnaire also includes a person’s guardian at least 6 feet or 1,8 metres.
No drugs yet known to prevent COVID-19.For the vaccine has not been anticipated until the beginning of 2021, the main part of the COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic, which is known as "building".
The CDC also recommends that people often cut off their hands with hair and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands appear to be cottured, before eating, and after splitting food, stone, or wheat.
Moreover, the CDC also emphasizes the use of the basic alcoholic service that contains at least 60% of alcohol, but only when weapons and waters are not available. In the area that is not available, the WHO provides two forms for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity originates of etanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help lose bacteria tracks in alcohol; it is "not active for hand-sepsepsis".
Gliserol was put as a humetic.
People are subject to support, which can include oxygen support, and support other vital organs.
The CDC reminds people who cared that they were taking a virus to use a simple face mask.
Oxigenation of extracorporeum breeding (ECMO) has been used to resolve the disaster failure, but its benefit is still considered.
Remember, self - cleanness, lifestyle, and healthy food are recommended to increase immunity.
A supportive advice may be used for those who have a rare signal at the beginning of the infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of Tiongkok have issued a recommendation to handle the COVID-19 advocates concerned.
In the United States, intensive and experts have introduced recommendations from various parts to free sources, the IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 yet.
For signs, some medical neighbors are more common than parasetamol (asetaminofen) than ibuprofen for the first line.
Preventions must be taken to minimize the risk of virus-education, mainly in health care when making a process that can result in, such as intubacy or hand ventilation.
For a health career of COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person is placed in the Tular-Udara Infections (AIIR) room other than using standard impairment, contact failure, and disturbance. CDC provides a request for use of self-defense tools during the pandemics.
Recommended device is: APD clothes, respirators or face maskers, eyes protection, and medical hands. If available, the respirator (not a wide mask) is better.
N95 reflector is accepted for industrial instructions, but the FDA has authorised this mask to be used on the basis of the Darurat User Authorisation (USA).
The N95 respirator was designed to protect from the air-treaming particulate as a wheel, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unused use on the label.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends that you use a hardware protection or, as the last effort, your own building mask.
Most cases COVID-19 are not too hard to need mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are hard.
The type of support for persons who experience the failure of the COVID-19 threatening is active for those who are concerned with the low, and there are evidence that intubacy can be avoided by the high-aliasing canel or pressure of an unusual air pressure.
It is not known whether one of these two methods has the same benefit for those who are sick.
Some doctors are more likely to use invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technology decreases the particular preaching compared to the higher alert canal. A higher case occurs in the age (earlier than 60 years older, and the age of 80 years older).
Many other countries have no place of sleeping in the hospitals, which decreases the health capacity of the health system to handle the COVID-19 cases immediately that are enough to need an inap.
A study in Tiongkok found that 5% of the unit of intensive survey, 2,3% need support for mechanical ventilation, and 1,4% died.
In Tiongkok, approximately 30% of the COVID-19 advocates who were finally concerned with the ICU.
The mechanical ventilation becomes more rare in the syringe of accurate insight (ARDS) occurred in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
The ventilator that is able to control pressure modes and the high EP is necessary to maximize oxygen hypertensions at the same time reducing the risk of ceder powder and the dangerous ventilator pneumotoracs.
The high EP may not be available for a long ventilator.
The survey on the potential was started in January 2020 and some antivirus medicines are in clinical trials.
It seems to be the most promised.
Although new medicines may need time until 2021, some tested medicines have been accepted for other uses or have been in the next study.
Antivirus diseases can be affected by a person who has painful disease.
Recommendated colleagues are in the test of potential treatment efficiency and safety tests. FDA has given temporary authorisation for convalesen plasma as a experimental advice in the case of a person's life very or even increasingly.
Plasma convalesen has not yet conducted clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, Tiongkok released the application to handle this disease.
User requested to enter their name and ID.
This application can detect 'contact near' using survey data so that you can detect the risk of infection.
One user can also examine the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is detected, the application is not only recognizing that the karantine is increasing, but also members are known to local health workers. The phone data analysis, → telephone research, and the building skills are used to find infectioned people and contacted with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapura.
In March 2020, Israel’s government allowed the security body to find the phone data of those who were locked by the coronavirus.
That step was taken to meet the karantine and protect those who may have been contacted with infected citizens.
Moreover, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the local phone data agregation to the German Federal Government, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent virus preachers.
The Russian uses an outstanding knowledge to identify the carantine operator.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said it was given to the phone operator that "40% of the citizens are still moved to the place."
The German government made the end of Friday 48 hours with more than 42,000 people.
Moreover, the president of Estonia, Christmas Kaljulaid, made a global call for creating solutions against the coronavir preacher.
Many can experience the pressure of karantine, traveling, self - control, or fear of the infection themselves.
BBC highlighted Rory O'Connor who said, "The highlight of social isolation, singleness, health threat, stress, and economic emphasis is a perfect body that threatens mental health and society health."
This illness can have a little or without a sign, which includes the illness of the illness of the illnesses, such as the pile.
As a result, it may be necessary for a period of two weeks, while those who call to the disease of the diseases of the disease or criticism may need three to six weeks to be healthy.
Women may have higher risk for COVID-19 infections based on data from similar virus, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 still are less. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the powder so that it causes pneumonia.
In the most spectacular person, COVID-19 can quickly develop to be an accurate sign (ARDS) syndrome that causes disasters, sectics, or failure of major organs.
Increasing complications with COVID-19 including sepsis, abnormal blood bleeding, and destruction of heart, gender, and heart.
Blood bleeding, especially the protrombin time exposure, is shown to 6% of the COVID-19 patients who are concerned with an efficiency, while the geneal functions are displayed at 4% of this flash.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19s show the heart enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between signs and death is ten days, and five days are spent in the middle.
However, the patients moved to the ICU have seven days of median time between an inap and death.
In a study that investigates early cases, the median time begins from the beginning story to death was 14 days, with a full rent of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) the guys have 2,8% death wines, while women have 1,7% death wines.
The histopatological exhibition of the post-mortal puzzle shows the alveolar disorder with the seluler fibromicsoid exhausts in the two pairs.
Sitopatical changes are observed on pneumocytes.
Pairs are a syndrome of accurate inflammation (ARDS).
In 11,8% of the death reported by the Commission for National Health of Tiongkok, the heart deteriorated, with the tropone or stop the heart.
According to the data of Maret from the United States, 89 per cent of people who are concerned about have the conditions of delivery, which also affect the mortality of medical and social economy.
The mortality’s thinking of the conditions is caused by the differences of the region, but also because of methodological challenges.
At least, the number of cases can cause the dead wine to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that death is a result of the past cases that may mean that death is too low.
Perkok has the probability of 1,4 times greater experiences the COVID-19 signal and about 2,4 times more likely needs intensive survival or death than that is not an enemy. There is anxiety about this disease.
The Hungarian Holy Authority found a 20%-percent ability for some who are disturbed from disease, and the disorder shows that the organs are lost.
This can also cause the syndrome of anti-intelligency after healing.
Until March 2020, infections are not yet known if they give effective immunity to those who have been cured from this disease.
Immunity may be obtained if you see another coronavirus behaviour, but it has been reported that there was a case of COVID-19 treatment followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days after that.
This case was determined to be a harmful infection, not a repeated infection.
This virus was determined by nature and from animals through divorced infections.
In fact, it is not known, but in December 2019, the preaching of the infections of the entire world was inspired by the escape of humans to humans.
A study on 41 first COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the first newspaper on 1 December 2019.
WHO’s newspaper reported the first magazine on December 8, 2019.
In general, some values were used to calculate mortality.
This is based on areas and time, and is affected by the number of studies, the quality of health care systems, the options, the time since the first time, and the character of population such as age, the species of age, and health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO sets the ICD-10 disease code of U07.1 for the death of the SARS-CoV-2 infectious infection and U07.2 for the death of COVID-19 that was diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without confission for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death ratio against the case indicates the number of deaths divided by the number of cases was diagnosed in a specific time range.
According to the University of Johns Hopkins, the death ratio on global cases was 6,9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number of people who died from certain diseases, and the IFR fatality, which reflects the percentage of infections (diagnose and non-diagnose) that died from certain diseases.
This statistics have not been timed and followed the particular population begins from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone infected with antibodies, antibodies can provide information about the number of infections.
In the Italian episode, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4600 citizens, 80 (1,7%) has died.
In Gangelt, this disease was translated through the Karnaval festival, which was translated to young people, caused relatively lower mortality, and probably not all COVID-19 deaths were classified as COVID-19 death.
Moreover, the German health system has not yet been limited.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have an antibodies, like the blood donor.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were confiscated because of COVID-19.
The painfulness of his mortality was different for men and women.
Mortality is higher for men in the study in Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50s, with a risk between men and new women not appearing at 90s.
In Tiongkok, the death winning for a man was 2,8 percent and 1,7 percent for a woman.
The reason for the difference is not known, but the genetic factor and behavior may be a reason.
Immunological differences are based on genuine sex, the prevalence is lower to women, and men who have the conditions of comorbidity, such as hypertension, at younger age than women can contribute to a higher mortality to men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected people are men and 72% of the people died because COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the US governments did not find the famous type of gender data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS have different effects.
Percentage of health employees who have higher women’s experiences, especially employment, and they have higher benefits to have virus.
World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the name of this disease is "COVID-19".
The WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is the situation for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time of identification: 31 December 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid references to a specific geografic location (e.g. Tiongkok), species of animals, or a group of people, compared to international security recommendation to prevent stigmatisation. The virus that causes COVID-19 was given the name of the coronavirus accurate system 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Good disease and lazim virus is called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of Wuhan, Tiongkok, the virus and the disease are called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO commented on 2019-nCoV and the 2019-nCov accommodation disease as a temporary name for virus and disease according to the 2015 doctor who did not use local names in the name of disease and virus.
The names of the COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limits of capacity in the standard ship, some digital products cover health care, such as the use of the natural and ventilator component.
In one example, when a Italian hospital home really needs a ventilator chat, and the farmer can't give it in a needed time scale, a local company's turning back and cut 100 cats that are needed in the evening.
At the beginning of the COVID-19, the theory of conspiration, adequate information, and is informed about the source, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which are divided rapidly.
The human seems to be able to put the virus into some other animals.
Unable to find evidence of virus replication on babe, beach, and jail.
There are no medicines or vaccines agreed to treat this disease.
International investigations on vaccine and COVID-19 are understood by government organizations, academic reliefs, and industrial investigations.
In March, the World Health Organization used "SOLIDARITY Trial" to deal with the effect of four antivirus treatment that already exists with the most promising honour.
The vaccine is not yet available, but many are active to develop vaccine candidates.
Previous investigation against SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were used together to use ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies that are being studied.
First, investigators intended to make the primary virus vaccine.
The use of that virus, well inactive or dead virus, is intended to quickly carry the response of human body to new COVID-19 infections.
Secondly, the vaccine is intended to create vaccine that makes a sensitive immune system for certain submunities on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the investigation focused on S-spike proteins that helped virus to enzyme receptor ACE2.
Third is a nuclear vaccine (DNA vaxin or RNA, a new vaccination technique).
On March 16, 2020, the first vaccine test was started with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaxin originates unfair genetic code from the virus that causes disease. About antibodies have been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still contraversial.
More than 300 active clinic tests were running in April 2020.
Seven tests test therapy accepted for malaria, include four studies against oxychlorocuine or chlorocuine.
The antivirus tests provided by new purposes constitute a large number of Tiongkok studies, with nine tests of Phase III at remdesivir in some countries with the time of the report at the end of April.
In April 2020, the dinamic development of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 is already available.A number of antivirus medicines that are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chlorokuin and oxychlorocuine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combinated with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there were temporary evidence for remdesivir.
The clinical advice is observed in patients treated with remdesivir in therapy.
Fase III Clinic Tests are in the United States, Tiongkok, and Italy. Klorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in Tiongkok in February 2020 with the first result.
Yet, there are calls for careful care against that rice.
Corean Health Authority and Tiongkok commented on the use of chlorokuine.
However, the Institute of Virologia Wuhan, although comments on the daily dose of one gram, notes that the dosis is two times very dangerous and can be rejected.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued the authorisation of use for oxychlorocuine and chlorokuine on the law of the doctors who cared for COVID-19.The Tiongkok Edition of 7 also defined interferon, ribavirin, or omifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data shows that the high dose of ribavirin is required to take SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration.Penelitian indicates that the initial premium against tonjolin protein by transmembran 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for the SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
• about chlorocuine and ́oxychlorocuine with or without azitromycin has a large limit that has prevented medical communities to use this treatment without further investigation. Oseltamivir does not affect SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Sitokin body complication can occur in COVID-19, the following steps.
There are evidence that the oxychlorokuin may have an antisytokine characteristic. Tocilizumab has been introduced in the treatment report by the National Health Committee for Tiongkok after a small study.
This work is being conducted in the 2th phase in the national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with diseases.
Combined with serum blood tests to identify the sitokin body, this medicinal product is intended to fight the sitokin body, which is the cause of death to some of the victims.
In 2017, antagonist interleukin-6 was accepted by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for treatment of sitokin steroid refractor syndrome induced by different causes, CAR T cell therapy.
At this time, there are no evidence that show that tocilizumab is a honest treatment for CRS.
Transfers of antibodies that are removed and reported by the system of people who have already been cured from COVID-19 to those who need it is being considered as non-vaxin passiv immunisation method.
This means to SARS with unconclusive results.
Netralization of virus is a work mechanism expected for passive antibodies can address defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellulary sitotoxicity based on antibodies and/or fagositosis, may also be possible.
The use of other paphic antibodies, for example, of the use of monochloral antibodies produced, is in development.
Convalesen serum production, which is a part of the blood of patients who have been healed and have a specific antibodies against this virus, can be reduced for faster use.
Coronavious disease, the fearful syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor in the House of the Point of Wuhan, who then died because COVID-19, after the consciousness of the virus preacher.
