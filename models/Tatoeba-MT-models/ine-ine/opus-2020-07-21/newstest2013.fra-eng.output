A republic strategy for the re-electing of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this last as a myth, saying that electoral fraud is rare in the United States than the number of people killed by the foolish.
In addition, the Republican lawyers have only considered 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will be partly lost by the American Democratic System.
Contrary to Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
In this sense, most American governments have promoted new laws from 2009 which make the inscription or vote process more difficult.
This phenomena took the width after the elections of November 2010 which seemed to be 675 new republian representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft law restricting the exercise of vote law in 41 States were introduced during the only year 2011.
The new electoral laws require the electors to have a photography card and a proof of American citoyency.
Moreover, these laws decrease the previous voting periods, invalidate the right to register as electors on the day of the audience and return to the citizens with a Judician case of their voting right.
Before 2006's elections, no American state required electors to present an identity card with photography.
Indiana was the first State to put such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the Constitutionality of the Indian Law in 2008.
Republic authorities have expressed this practice to other States.
During the last two years, they had projects of law in 34 States to force electors to present an identity card with photography.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, the American citizens do not have universal identity cards like the disease insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million of voting people, have no identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their State.
Moreover, five million new electors in 2012 have no such identity.
However, it often costs more than 100 dollars for the required identity card.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities, and low income.
In fact, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people who win less than 35,000 dollars; 18 per cent of citizens of more than 65 years and 20 per cent of electors from 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity card with photography.
More.
Students, viewed as a voter for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photos issued by their institution.
However, these same States authorize the members of the fishing clubs or chasing clubs that vote more from the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required a proof of citizenship to vote.
Arına was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a twelve States have adopted laws required by electors to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
However, it appreciates that two Spanish electors on three favor the democratic party.
Moreover, the Republic Islators have underlined laws that abbolize the inscription of electors on the day of the inspection in eight States.
Moreover, they limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to electors who want to enter it.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral recording campaigns contributed to recording about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have cut 17% of the recording rate of new electors in 2010 compared to 2006.
Moreover, the Republic Islators adopted laws in five other States aiming to reduce the voting period by anticipation.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the electors who voted before were African and Americans, while those recently represented only 13 per cent of the State electors.
He did the same with the Spanish.
These represented only 11 per cent of electors, but 24 per cent of citizens who voted before.
In contrast, 76% of the electors represented only 46% of the voting electors.
Of course, the Democratic Islators and their supporters opposed the adoption of laws restricting the entry of electors.
Several legislative projects have been blocked by the vetos of democratic governments.
The United States General Advocate has been intervened to suspend the most controversed laws.
They could in part limit the deficiencies.
For example, only 16 from 34 States adopted laws requesting the presentation of an identity card with photography.
Nevertheless, the new rules set up will be indeni— to make the exercise of the voting law more difficult in 2012.
Democracy critics indicate the partial nature of the laws voted and see a clear goal to influence the results in 2012 in key States.
A report from the Centre Brennan of 2011 shows that the States who adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary to the electoral responsibility to recover the presidency.
It is too early to confirm that these isolated changes at the electoral system will have significant impact on the result of the presidential elections of 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will be partly lost by the American Democratic System.
Depisting the cancer of the prostate: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present wrong results, with false negative or even false positive results, which lead to unusual medical interventions.
What to do is more than the men who are already reticent to pass the depistage tests.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked two experts' opinion.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between witness groups, therefore it is difficult to interpret these data and to have closed recommendations.
Another study, that European, has concluded a difference of mortality between patients who have had a depistage and those who have not received it.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% of more opportunities to have metabolism if not devised.
So I recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if we have a direct parent who has already had a cancer of prostate.
African-American men are also more risky.
The key is to take the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are agressive cancers and other indolent cancers.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the risk degree of his cancer by providing him the possible options, not necessarily treating the cancers of prostate that do not reach long-term life, and instead, in these cases, for a active monitoring of disease.
Today, many people with whom a cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their life.
They will be suggested to make active monitoring, and if the disease progresses, we will offer them a treatment.
Moreover, the criteria to determine whether or not should be treated are determined.
I therefore recommend to pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether we should pass or not.
In relation to the International Urology Society, Movember created a tool to evaluate the APS test for and against.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately there is no miracle receipt to prevent cancer.
Despite research progress, the adoption of good life habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
We believe that if everyone eats well and moves enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If nobody would smoke anymore, this rate would strike at least 50%," indicates André Beaulieu, the cancer portfolio of the Canadian Society.
Instead, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heritage.
Many remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco remains a priority, despite the reduction of the number of smokers.
The cigarette is linked to 85% of the cases of powder cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other.
This is a great night for people's health.
"Tomorrow today, there are 1,5 million smokers in Quebec," the André Beaulieu portfolio deployes.
Encouraging gift: 10 years after the leave of the cigarette, the risk of a half-fall cancer.
The weight
Embonpoint and obesity also promote the appearance of the disease, the SCC.
They would increase the risks of cancer of the cancer of the soap, the cool and the rect, the oesophage, the pancreas and the uterus.
"The research shows that the regular practice of activity under a whole life protects against the cancer of the colon," it is.
Food
It also recommends limiting its use of red meat.
In too large quantity, it makes the risks of reaching a colorectal cancer.
Carcuts also, and they should be avoided.
Keeping meat by smoking, sugaring or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"There can damage the cells of the cancer and lead to the development of cancer," explains.
Vitamines
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplies and cancer.
However, their research is not concluding for the instant.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, SCC.
While one of them found a decrease of the risk of cancer of prostate, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not even established.
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about her concerns and family anticipations with her doctor.
"To put a depistage test, it doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs' Cooked Boss
The announcement of the discovertee of Higgs' boss has created a whole emotion, the last age, and for reasons.
In fact, we believe that this boss is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but this.
And then, it is the last part of which the existence is presented by the standard Model - our best, or "better" explaining the nature and the behavior of the material - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicians, it's not completely sure that it's good for Higgs.
We know without doubt the shadow of an accurate new particulate, and that it replies much to the Higgs boss predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, new data developed this week at a large congress in Kyoto are confirmed, but there are still no data to be completely sure about it.
Let's assume that it's good for Higgs, because the chances of getting stumbled lies, and let's see what's going on.
There is, in this low world, a fatally inconvertable law that wants that two things cannot be found at the same place at the same time.
No way to violate this rule - and do not try too strong, you'll hurt.
But even if the parts are a very strange world, it also shows that it has a law of such kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particulates cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state" - this "status" consisting greatly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicians class the parts in two categories.
In a corner, there are good citizens called farmers who are wisely obedient to Pauli’s principle.
And in the other way, the boys are acting, a salt band of anarchists that do not respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be good and well at the same place, at the same time.
The Particle Adventure, the Berkeley Laboratories: the massons, which we will not reach here, and the "force particulates", through which the major forces of nature spread and to which Higgs' boss would be in some way apparent.
These boys, we need to highlight it here, are not all the exotic bicycles that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it is through a boss of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "Light Part" that is the "Ger" of the electrical force.
When, in fact, a partition with a accelerated electric load or a change of direction, it "foreign" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, a little like a launched box in a stack.
From this "department" is born a electromagnetic water (of light, or of infrared, or of ultraviolet, etc.), and this where is nothing but a photon - and so one of the "force porters".
Field plus Stable
It's the same thing with the Higgs boss, in this difference nearly that it's another field, the Higgs field, which must be "deprecated" so that this boss appears.
But this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to exhibit it, it must reach very, very high energy, a little as if it was a frozen east whose only one very big rock could ride the surface.
That is why you need a large accelerator of particulates like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a year of 27 km of circumference! - to achieve such energy.
Analogia with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the report between Higgs and the mass.
These are not all particulates, or materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the loved ones, do it, but others are not - a bunch of paper, for example, will never keep himself on a frig.
And in the same way, these are not all parts that interact with the Higgs field: those who make it have a mass, while others (like the photon, keep it) do not have it.
Now, what can "to bring" all these research, Mrs. Plamondon ask?
For science, this is to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and it also allows the physicians to examine any distinction between observations and predictions of the MS.
Moreover, they are more to wish to be found, because the small difference could open a door on a "new" and move some of the model.
This, it must be said, has even great carences, without proposing any explanation for gravity (ops!) or the shadow material, which forms about 80% of the universe's material (re-ops!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these research in the day of lady and lady All Monday are more difficult to preach, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be nowhere.
Behold: At the beginning of the 60s, laser pioneers, in the Bell Laboratories, had no doubt of the revolution that their travels were going to delay.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing left.
In fact, we have already said that the doctor Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself put the first continuous laser (the first was pulsed), in 1962 - the layer was in place as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instruments around the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle put a little light sensor in 1969 during its optical travels.
This sensor, although it was not of all his original intention, now serves "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and he valued the Nobel of 2009.
That doesn't mean that LHC's activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
Paliative cares - The best way to make... → Le Devoir
With his Commission's dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be repeated as a draft law is prepared.
But in this important area, many are still doing.
The Device tried to look closer to it.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in her apartment of Monteregia.
The cancer of the prostate that drew him had left him a recurrence of two years.
"They gave me five years to live," I was seven years old," he said, "mi-rain mi-figue, extended in his bed to the Victor-Gadbois palatiative care house, from Beloeil, where the watch came.
"But it's always a chock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease makes its work: a great weakness that prevents him from getting alone to the toilet, even to eat alone.
Attracted before a pleasant breakfast, he accepts to allow himself to help eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even smiles, speaks to the incon’s careers around him, brings his medicines to him, offers him a bain.
The courage of the mother's death.
"My biggest desire is to cure me from the diarrhee, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a medicine for this bad.
"In our lives, a man, it's going up, "ra Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Return to the child's stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the ability of the person to accept regression, it states.
Because, from the opinion of a number of people who work in paliative care, great moments are decreasing in the heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palatiative care home suffer from cancer.
They have an maximal life pronostic of three months.
At this stage, the "the team of doctors and infirmers who are around doesn't provide any more care of the " curatives".
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to be "conscious and tough."
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she says.
"I have no more desires in my life," she said before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She also expects, in the next days, a last visit from her son came from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of benefits, the care of the body and food assistance are prodictioned.
It's the paliative care that we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make the death more comfortable.
In Quebec, 11 700 people have a paliative care bed.
It's very little when we know we're all ending on one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains the Dre Christian Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Let it be at the level of comfort, emotional or spiritual.
At the board, we will accept providing your mouth care to brandy or Pepsi, the request.
Diabetes will no longer be able to control their sugar rates.
And death is part of the day.
We used a beer to Mr. X last night.
This morning, it's his son who'll finish the beer at the feet of the dead.
"We are helping the neighbors as well as patients, "a Nathalie Savard, care director.
At Victor-Gadbois's house, the days follow, but don't lie.
At the side of an old man of 93 years who has a family assembly in the court, quickly silent in his ears while we are dressed in her honour, a 36-year-old young man died dramaticly, around his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried to survive.
"Seven months ago, there are still three to five beds occupied by cancers less than 45 years old," the Dre Christiane Martel was concerned.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Error accessing paliative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians simply do not have access to paliative care, which is the designation of concerns designed to pass the sufffrance when a disease has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether home, hospital or in the house of care.
And several organisms, such as Victor-Gadbois house and the Paliative Care Society at the Grand Montreal home, are specialized more or less in the care offered to cancers.
This is precisely this great deterioration in the health care of Quebeco, which makes the fear of a number of specialized doctors in palatiative care of the adoption of a law in the framework of euthanisation and self-sufficiency.
Since October, a manifest, signed in summits of palatiative concerns including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, is to witness their opposition to such initiatives.
According to the Dre Christian Martel, the Quebeco health system is not enough to ensure that each will have the right to paliative quality care before it is accepted to proceed to euthania.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spending 14 days in anxiety, in great pain, without doing what is needed to deal with her.
I'm afraid that patients ask only because they don't receive appropriate care.
And parallelly, many oncologists find out on their patients until the last day, despite the worst pronostics.
Helène Richard's survival hopes were already minimised when she left a testing chemotherapy.
When I announced my uncle that I stopped the treatment, she replied that she was regreting that I stop taking it, she told me.
Yet, she told me I was over!
No powerful care
The Dre Martel believes that 90% of the sick people who ask to be thanks for not accessing their request after they have been disturbed from their pain by a paliative care team.
But it is good to say that palliative cares are not absolutely powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, paliative care guide to the Grand Montreal Paliative Focus Society, patients would be refracted to the treatment of pain in 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, the doctors have so often reached the palliative seatation, which returns to the patient until his death, or as well as permanently.
We can't seem to hear this part of the souffrance.
Moreover, the non-substrated disease will have the opportunity to have this paliative seat.
The sick who are not sorrowed always say the same phrase: "I want to do."
But that doesn't mean necessarily "I want you to euthanase me," that means "I want to be loud."
The implementation of this report has been made possible through a broadcast of the Canadian Health Research Institutes.
Immobilious scanners of large widespread in Quebec
Severy officers, BTP undertakers, political and specialists of the Italian mafia's fund collectors raise daily what they know of an amazing "sêème", mixing the building industry, officers, politicians, syndicalists and mafia.
A " industry " which costed very close to Quebeco contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's interesting as the system's crazy since the great means have been taken," Ironized Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and the former police officer of Montreal.
It is by him that the scandale was extended in 2011, through a funding investigation on the crimes related to road travel contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of Liberal Times, Jean Charest, had only been recovered.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, occult financing of parties and the corruption of officers.
"From the beginning of the request in 2010, he highlights, the only Transport Ministry would have spared a billion dollar on contracts," some refreshing their instincts to touch a quota-part!
The Charbonneau Commission " has already fallen two masses," he hopes that it can "demonstrate strategy behind individuals".
A permanent anticorruption unit created in 2011
The Permanent Anticorruption Unit, created in 2011, also joined it with its army of verifiers, investigators and analyses of the Government.
More policies of the "Marteau Escudo" who, since 2009, would have led the "Equal Card" of Montreal to put the sweet pedal on contracts...
In recent weeks, she has committed a series of inquiries and has brought fraud and corruption against municipal elections, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, master of a campaign city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just missed from his maire post of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspicioned that it has put up repeated pools in exchange of public contracts.
They are formally accused of engineers from Montreal and Italian enterprises, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
This was a sensation by explaining to the Committee the mechanism of the "sem" obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia that returned the money to Montreal, the part of Major Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito seeded all winds in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 Canadians (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals.
He also agreed to have organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Prime Minister of Liberal Ministry, Nathalie Normandeau.
Egout contracts whose costs were covered
In Montreal, the "sem" of corruption worked around.
Overwhelming Gilles, an ex-engineer in public travels, has detailed it before the committee: in ten years, he has received cadeal building companies, invitations to traveling, golf tours, restaurants, shops of hokey and powder-wine, totalising $736,000, in exchange of egout contracts whose costs he was lost.
Other virgin officers have admitted that the patt has been greened by 30% to 40% of the factures, by extra fake.
Then an organizer of the Mayor party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay to have deliberately closed the eyes on a parallel budget that feeds his cash with his money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay released the beginning of November, floating Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elections of Montréal to take the alarma sonnet.
More of the River-des-Prairies Arrondissement, on the east of the island, is insured since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land buying 5 million dollars and returning... 1,6 million promotors, in full immobiliary boom.
70% of money in electoral campaigns
From the question that will finally be put in place, she says that she "shoot on a shelter that allows to understand the function of the system, infiltred by the fires, to stop the gangrene and to eye the faults".
The process, she says, is "worry but positive".
We're cleaning the plague, but we're going to have to make a clean search unit in Montreal and a watch, so that we can't see the doubtful practices return.
As we're doing the household.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "the officers stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but especially concerned about the role of "elues on the stratagème" when they did not treat the mago!
Assessing 70% of money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironicly said, "I was told that it was only a pool reflecting reality."
The Quebeco Government proposes to limit the donations to the parties to 100 dollars but it will not change the damage, and it will say, "When the electoral expenditures are not limited strictly, there will be money in politics."
He proposes a complete review of the system of public contracts and financing of parties: "We can't go down; go to the ground of things, with courage, will allow the house to rebuild on stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story has the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who do not look at it in their own corner...
"The PSG is not the Barcelone FC!"
This season, you took a new envergure with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by an individual conscience, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I'm going to be on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On the day, these items move me to highlight my game level.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything's going to be quick in the foot.
But I'm not burning.
From my beginning to the Preparation Centre of the INF at my pass to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by paliers.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
Recurses of this year are used to be available to very high-level matches.
They also know that each train is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti offers me much about my position.
He is sprayed by adjoints like Makelele, who played at the same place as I.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technicians.
Today, it is not equal to Ligue 1 and is part of the best European enterprises.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with hunted clubs.
He covered great players.
I think he'll get other titles to Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I was out of a series of wounds.
The confidence he agrees to me also explains my performances.
What are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of leader.
But we're staying in an embussy.
One of our major objectives is the Ligue of champions: we have been qualified for the 8th end in the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say against very good European teams.
We want to end the first of our pool before Porto to get back at the 8th end of return.
Could the PSG become a short-term European club?
He already has the budget...
To become a large European club, Paris needs to receive titles and enter into the duration.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means to concrete this project.
In Ligue 1, don't get the title, like the last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would represent a great deception.
This year, we really have the heart to put this champion title.
Last season, we haven't gone far.
In May, there was deception because we had the quality to finish first.
We've done a very big season.
We ended with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has made a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are at the fight for the title, I think we have weapons to take it.
Do you think media expect too much of the PSG?
It is normal that many of us are expected to see what has been invested and players we have.
We're totally accepting it.
Then, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and find things to reproach us, it's certain that it's a little frustrating.
We're wondering what people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelone FC!
We're trying to install a game project.
A team is building up with time.
We proved in Ligue of champions that we could answer presents.
Look at Manchester City that doesn't come from two towns, to qualify for the 8th final, they have also made great expenditure!
In view of the invested amounts, you were imagined with 15 points forward to the tree!
It was to disturb our opposers and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is passive.
I hope that in May, we can have the smile by saying that, despite all difficulties, we have ended with it.
The PSG is totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic operators.
Better than we say there's a Zlatan dependence.
This means that Ibrahimimovic is very perfect and that he puts a lot of goals.
He's here for this, and he proves that he's the star of the Ligue 1.
He showed everywhere that he was a big player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This moves others to highlight their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you view the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a deception.
I had the heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my wound prevented me from playing time.
I've seen things there, and I've got out of it strengthened.
Today, I can make good choice matches.
That's what I hoped since I was baptized with the Blues.
We have drawn out the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we must have an example of behavior today.
What are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the quality group for the World.
The selector is strict, close to players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Bla.
But I don't want to compare.
Bla ́ had reached its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
The good node (1-1) acquired on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone's got up for everyone.
Before this chock in Spain, I never had a similar match in my career.
Avec Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The contrary to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and treatment costs between interested parties.
Furthermore, as often in these areas, a political vision is insufficient: the conviction that the current monetary system, which makes monopoles, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonyme), is at the same time a currency (may convertible to dollars, euros...) and a safe exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of par par pars.
Approximately 200 000 transactions have already been recorded by 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a sum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning to this day around a 10 dollars (the courses are calculated on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on currencies held in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currency".
Bitcoin is different from other types of currency such as "credits" used to progress in a video game we win by playing or buying (and sometimes turning back).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
However, each time a central authority controls and handles exchanges.
Avec Bitcoin, all the news of the network are both accounts, checkers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in a way of e-mail.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, ensureing that it is anonymous.
An information record related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to make sure that switched bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It has the right to acquire this additional line, which is the result of the resolution of a matematic challenge to computers, and whose winner, such as the provisional central bank.
This is a file-hashing phase, which is the transformation of a large file to a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and make it a number before "hacker" en.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special print (much of zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily check that it's the right thing.
The transaction is then unstructively linked to the string of the other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, for frauding, a user wanted to pay two times with the same silver very quickly (not less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be valided by the network - the other remaining orpheline because both have different prints.
The computer who resolved the challenge is 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this re-section is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
So the number of bitcoins in employment is limited to 21 million, but they are said to 100 million, which leaves the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also revealed to each increase in calculation capacity.
The network's life has already had high and lower.
Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and furnished bitcoins.
"The failure used doesn't refer to the protocol itself," assured Pierre Noizat, who just started Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also provides the possibilities of purchasing money through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Weight operators such as Wikipedia are the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Sha and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not have.
In November, "geant soldies" were held.
"Treven thousand dollars have been switched," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this own as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which so are less lovers.
The portor has more identity and thus can be anonymous.
The system is easy to run in goods, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
They have enough to make a address that a phone can "fotographer and recognize", explains Pierre Noizat, which provides thousands of users.
There is a general movement of remission in the case of hierarchic systems for more horizontal systems.
"They will need time to make Bitcoin busy, but 2013 may be a tourist," he foretold.
In its report, the ECB intends to re-evaluate the different risks, today considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We've gone from Afghanistan.
And then?
The French groups left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It's time that the Afghanistan Army is in possession of its territory and that the Afghanistan choose their future without waiting for us.
These are especially the Afghanistan countries we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And myself, with our 88 murdered soldiers, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremistes, ancient leaders repeated in Pakistan, but often of lands who have foreign army presence, such as the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaetic, even though they were joiadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Ozbeks, Tadjiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurance, these will not be anymore when the OÁaux will become more discrete.
The department of the French groups from Nijrab's base, which I observed from the highest of the planted addiers through French credits, was made in order.
Camions and blinds have joined Kaboul without being attacked, overwhelmed by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban differents on Kaboul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, the country of fire and blood by fighting between different factors.
Their control was then considered as a kind of freedom, a return to security.
The Afghanistans paid the price of the obscurance of those lands exceeded by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Ancient Modjahidin, Afghanistan and the current Taliban government are joined in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The significant principles of the antisobiotic war came to the power in 2001.
They moved to affairs, taking up governmental lands to return them in lands to bear income resources from Iran and Pakistan, which benefited from large American subtraction contracts.
They were deceived; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, strive to a government that is not constituted by furners.
Many youths want to go away, as those who have learned to benefit the American wide range: the escape of capital is significant.
Youths are fatigued by war and its ideals.
They have covered the modern world in their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and have appreciated the benefits of it.
Approximately 65 per cent of the population in less than 25 years; Kaboul now counts 5 million residents, a fifth of the total population.
In towns, government schools are full, girls like boys.
Young people who will not want to return to the obscurance of the elderly parties or to corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are portable phones; television, and its tourists who present a modern world are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Should the authorities who are to be commanded be considered as Impacts?
Earlier commanders of the anti-sovetic fight are already concerned about re-instituting provincial milicycles, which will escape from the central power.
Afghanistan, mountain countries, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation in the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, with the destruction of the Prime Minister's post since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially for the elections provided in April 2014.
But his country is, since the 50s and already before, depending on foreign aid.
No industry has been released on road, no bargage is in state, no important irrigation system is prepared.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and էums.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a devastated country for thirty years of war, a governmental control on infrastructure would have been necessary.
The voice was extended that Afghanistan had great mineral riches.
This only made it feel that the O≤aux were there to be only to do it.
Without energy to treat the iron or cover minery on the place, nor transport means to export it through the mountains, there is no miner operation.
The Chinese have almost left the cover mine of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to keep the large buddhic site and remain the most important employees in the province.
One day also, Afghanistan and Pakistan, with large imports and exports, will be required to repeat normal reports.
The department of French fighting groups ended on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides the continuation of traditional assistance: girls, boys, French department at University, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the Archeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "gage hearts and minds" and to perform the task that is impossible to coincide with criminal assistance and actions, a service of " civil-military action" of the Defense Minister (Cimic), who was removed in 2012, has led, and has made it well by a small French NGO, many collective enterprises and agricultural rehabilitation activities in tens of mountain villages.
These travels, guurmands in hand-d' local work, could help to contain injury: irrigation, pockets, potential water, rebound, fruit trees, sun protection and growing cross-borders.
What will we like to remember, after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys, often over 2,000 metres of height.
The ambassade received tens of written applications from small agricultural performances from local communities from the province of Kapisa.
In order to make them free of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, what the agricultors said to me, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled, civil aid in their behalf and directly touch them.
A Constitution for forces in Egypt
It's a new poker pack of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he decided to play all of it.
Taking all of them shortly, he announced, on Thursday, that the Constitutional Assembly would vote its final text on the next day.
Just one week ago, the Chairman of the State had granted this Assembly two months additional to finish his jobs.
This is soon two years that Egypt is supported on a provisional text, which has several times changed what fragiles the institutional stability and leads to legal embryo.
This new initiative has only increased fraction in the country.
For its opposers, the President continues in his "autocratic deliberation" and continues to "training his word" and "making the right."
On the side of its partners, it is a way to quickly end it with the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized in the fifty days.
A very short time laps that forces the Brothers to refuse their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic ability, while the contest is increasing in the whole country.
Mohammed Morsi's convinced that the Egyptians will vote favor, as he said in an interview at the Wednesday Time.
Since this vote to a vote is the last time to the Egyptian people: "If you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers," they should be able to finish after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this Constitutional Assembly, in large majority of islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals missed the call.
In November, a little before the Constitutional Declaration, they claimed the door, estimating that they could not make their views valid.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the needed quorum, 11 people, replacement members, have been able to quickly get tomorrow.
Some are very close to Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, it is the most often to the unity that the articles have been voted.
In addition, comments were amazed that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee estimating that the constitutional pendule was wrongly regulated.
The text, which was still voting last night, conducts 234 articles.
The objectives of all attention, Article 2 remain finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, establishing that "the principles of the charia are the main source of the right."
Salafist parties, for which the islamic law establishment is a major refund, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a stronger application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been held is a result of their good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisia," the liberals answer, which only see a shock of communication.
Because they are, the islamization of the Constitution is made through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular to verify the conformity of laws with the charia.
According to the Specialist of the So日 Pommier, it is anxious because "the people called to speak are not chosen and have no democratic initiative.
We can see the premies of a theocraty."
Moreover, the fears of liberals are expected by the fact that the next recipient of this university should be less moderate than the current.
"For the time there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the Civil State.
The majority of the jurists who worked on this text are not oléms but universitaries, for some formed in the French system" template Alexis Blouet, which prepares a tess on the constitutional transition of Egypt.
But he recognises " that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms of employed are involved in the religious vocabulary.
There is a reference to "fiqh" in particular [islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could be made to know in the future in which way civil judges are responsible for speaking over."
In addition to its religious aspect, the voted text yesterday is very critical because of the powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers appreciate that these are just reduced in comparison with what they were under the former regime.
Other liabilities: the powers granted to the army.
In accordance with the desire of military, the exam of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more than civils will be prohibited in military courts, such as human rights defence.
These are also part of their concerns about the text that they consider liberty.
The blasphem crime is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which may have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, particularly the pressure.
Furthermore, no items do not echo the protection of women, highlights Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
It states that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not in the original Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express himself at television last night, manifestations were provided this afternoon.
The support of the head of the State will defeat them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre, and a sea-sea are expected by the Ucrainian tourists
The Promised Land gathers the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and a salvation nature.
Argoumenty i日y has kept five major reasons for you to become Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
Return incontourable: the rivers of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever puts these "baptist funds" will be touched by God's Grace.
As regards Galilee, it is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he appeared the storm, or where the fish was wonderful.
This is exact place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is good in Jerusalem.
The believers and parking the Rue de la Souffrance or the path of Croix (latin: Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the Fortress of Antonia (the pretoria), where the proceeding was held, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Saint Sepulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the circofixion, and then to the Peter of the Onction and to the tomb.
This is the Christian center of the world, a symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the Christian end, the cross monastery is raised to the place where the tree was used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also opens the most holy place of the Lamentations: the Mure of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to the tradition, people of different confessions leave small words associated with prayers that are then heard.
See the height
Visit the ruins of the Massada Force, an ancient refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Grand in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the broken rocks of a mountain to 450 m above the sea level.
Only alpinism amators can make it by their own means.
For others, a telepheric brings them to this full story.
At the north of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m height, the ski station of Mont Hermont is located, which takes many tourists the winter.
A ship can lead you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski tracks make up at a total of 45 km long.
Ancient believers want to live in the top of the mountains of the Gentiles.
Visit unique museums
This country opens nearly 300 museums.
Could not visit all of them during one single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really worth the turn.
Top: the Museum of Israel near Knesset (the Parliament).
He opens the very old manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Death Sea, covered in the grottes of the wilderness of Judea, as well as about 500 thousand archeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Art Museum of Tel-A.
There are mainly the toilets of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha waits for you with its Turkish bags composed of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only Museum Ra private where you can add Rodin sculptures.
There are no guides or memory butics.
The entry is free and the gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocauste or Memorial of Yad Vashem, held in Tel-A日, which returns to the most dramatic history pages of the history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built for memory of 1,5 million children expired in concentration camps and gas rooms.
You enter and penetrate in a total darkness.
Stars are shintling.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the country where they are dead.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and welfare
The three large balnear stations of Israel are located on the borders of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Death Sea.
Each of them offers pools, water parks, delphinariums and genuine aquariums.
Note: You can run into the Red Sea even the winter, because the water temperature does not below 21° while the air can reach 23°.
The Death Sea is still warmer and you can get there all the year.
This is the most unique sea in the world: it takes the lowest point of the Earth, or 417 m below the sea level.
The blue color water contains saumure and easily takes the bathroom, even those who don't know narrow.
The landscapes around it are a surrealistic beauty.
There is a treatment based on salted water, limon, curative bottles and to treat various diseases such as dermatites, allergies, asme, echema, arthritis, bronchites, diabetes, but also for all simply to be detained.
Discover the secrets of Ancientity
They are kept by the old city of Tel-A, Jaffa, on the border of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the glorious Via Maris, which links Egypt, Â, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptians of the Earth.
According to the end, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Persee saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he has a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk in the streets that bring the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to your sign, the destination will smile you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young married who came to make photo sessions of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, King Herod's city, you will be able to swallow in the Roman theatre, "conquire" the strength of the crossed.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is currently used for evening concerts and opera spectacles.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your own: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your journey, it is better to prefer the dollars in the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (for now 1 dollar equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
For the urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a quick tramway and Haïfa has the only metro line of the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the low and higher parts of the city.
It's almost a subterranean funeral.
The travel in all types of common transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1 hour 30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to collect the Sabbath on the Sabbath.
From Friday night at sunset on Sunday, markets, stores and public transport stopped their activity.
And the working week starts Sunday morning.
Many coffee, restaurants and hotels serve only of casher food, which excludes sugar, sea fruit, fish without equivalents and plats combined with milk and flesh.
There is a total of age and sheep, suppers and desserts based on coco milk, but also the homous, the traditional Jewish powder, the different sauces, the moleculed wheat bottles, the favelles, the fruits and the aluminiums.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of Israel's cities.
Instead, there are many good food cats that produce high air.
We can see them sleeping at night on the gared car bags.
These flights love the places and they do not just regulate them.
The location of a car varies according to the mark of $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs $15 per day.
Louing a wheel will cost you 15 shekels a day.
A input to the museum costs in average 30 shekels.
The language of the numbers
Three million tourists around the world visited Israel in 2012.
It was especially people coming to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118,8 miles of Ucrainian tourists became the Promised Land from January to October 2012, or 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa on 9 February 2011.
"Who has the language to Moscow": the migrants economy money for the language
While Members and human rights soldiers are polymetic on what the law on the obligational language tests will be given, frauders who sold "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Each year, 13 million migration workers come to Moscou, Saint-Petersbourg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: winning money to help their family remaining at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and has established that each migration worker must take a Russian examination.
This rule is currently subject to those who intend to work in the services sector, housing, private and detailed sales services.
However, with time, the Federal Service promises that tests will be obligatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and the rights foundations.
The Russian language knowledge must be valided for → and renew its work allowance.
Only the citizens of the countries where Russia has the official language status are released.
Persons who have received certificates or education diplomas before URSS falling in 1991 are not even concerned with this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and rights protection
The Network of Examen Centres will be subject to the Russian Language Institute Pouchkine, the University of People's Friendship, the University of Moscow State, the University of Saint-Petersbourg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass reviews in all cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Court and the Federal Service.
But before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What is the obligation to know Russian will change for Russian and immigrants?
On the other hand, the representatives of the Service will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from "slave to work".
Many speak about the defence of the rights of migration workers, explaining the director of the Russian Federal Service of the Tadjikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The rights protection must be started before they go.
Only a organized choice system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign ovs.
Problems are made for non-professional migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is intended to cross the bad people who, under the pretext of help, will provide him a "travel" in a superpopulated house where he and the tens of his likes will turn for months without food and without paper and have to send between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"By them, they are promised a thing, and when they come, they are missing, they take their passport, and they do not touch the planned salary," confirms the Chief of the Property Services for the work of the Tadjikistan Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't dispute me, Mr. Police!
However, many citizens of Central Asian Republics who want to win money in Russia believe that they do not only know the language of the country where they want to come, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, it is not their fault, but their badness: a few Turksways, Ouzbeks, Tadjiks can be allowed to follow if only a primary teaching.
In fact, their families do not even have anything to eat their children without speaking to accommodate them correctly and equipped them for the oil.
Since they arrive to adolescence, these young people are going to win money since the opportunity is present.
It's hard when we don't know the language, if they trust it.
"You feel decreased and soon."
The Defensors of Human Droits, however, notice a significant aspect of the language law.
The reviews will only be assigned to migrants who have a statutory status.
Without a statue, there will be no exam or official work afterward.
However, most migration workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
" Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy for a official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
Moreover, moneyalisation costs: between 12 and 16 miles of rubbles.
And then, we can have a fake recording quickly for only 1.500 rolls.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no recording, where the cases of extortion are.
"They ask us 100, 200 rolls, what to buy cigarettes, the thee," the journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, the citizens of Tadjikistan.
"Speak fast, don't lean and buy a beautiful work of art"
Since the first day of entry into force of the language law, the registration papers of migrants were not the only to be false.
Several false language translation certificates have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Service.
Papers qualified are out of a color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not earn them for nothing: every migrant who would like to easily ease the task of the exames had to deploy seven thousand rolls for this document.
It's two and a half dearer than the official procedure: this will cost the worker who migrates three thousand rolls.
The representatives of the power and defense of the Human Droits agree to say that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper stacks".
The authorities may give migratory workers who could not validate the first time review to follow language courses.
Moreover, the immigrants who do not know Russia will be proposed to work in areas that do not involve actively with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take care of the weapons market
The part of crimes involved in arms is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to violate the law against civil weapons ports.
This is the reaction of the authorities against recent incidents: that it is the courses made in marriage or murder organised by the Moscow jury Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven dead.
The police wants to prohibit the port of caoutcho weapons in the public places and rebuild the age of receipt of weapons of weapons by making it 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the Chief of the Douma Committee on Security and Conflict against corruption, Irina Yarowaya, who promised that the amendments to the Law on Arms would be introduced to the State Douma next.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "laughing the vineyard".
A open letter is shown on the Net where its authors, representatives of various course centres, requires to leave "the insensitive duration".
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapons is minimal, stated to the Russian Vasiliy Lesnikov, legalist and specialist of the crime for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, for a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were made with a fire weapons in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent the benefits of the black market .
According to them, we can find any weapons for a reasonable price in Moscow today.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the diffusion of illegal weapons.
Providers: from the machine to officer
The black weapons market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are at the number of five, ra · Victor Baranets, colonel at the retraite, who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Fourth.
Capture d'altaran from a site that takes arms commands
The first is "the military track", namely the weapons that have been furnished during military operations in the Caucase.
"These weapons were furnished by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons issued from the black market are those deployed by the forces of the order.
Baranets explains that it is both the weapons of the police stocks and that they are directly devoted to the representatives of the order forces.
Illegal guns are sold from military ships.
Many of these recents have often been exploited.
"The confirmed versions indicate that some incidences have been delayed to dissimulate deficit," explains the ancient military.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons that do not match competition on the international market and echo the weapons on the black market, especially in Moscou," says a expert.
One of the other sources of black market is the contraband.
A major part of guns and mitrailletes come from poor countries, such as Kirghizia.
"We find a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia formed and organized the supply," says the ancient military.
Where's the weapons coming from?
Experts evaluated the application of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was made in 2011 by the Center for Analysis of Problems and Studies for Administration.
Specialists have analysed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, the documents and the data of the weapons portfolio.
The majority of illegal weapons, explaining researchers, comes from the military and the forces of the order.
The half of the weapons presented on the black market have been found "from the employees whose work is linked to the weapons," it is explained in the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from military conflicts, 14% are stealed at the time of production and 5% are issued of "fo clandestines".
A seller and advisor of a armoury requested to keep the anonymate ensures that no one has been buying the weapons found by these clandestine specialists for a long time; they are too old.
The most often, he, the sellers will search for new goods in military entities.
The person bought by a unit, for example a TT gun.
We're booking it with the marketing by a grillage.
"He transports it into town and returns for $900 per unit with two chargers," he says.
"The police is true of all cases, so when crimes are on the point of becoming him, it makes a control buy at illegal weapons goods," says the seller.
" Like in a bottle of luxes "
The seller and the buyer are usually through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy appears and suggests me to come to Begovaya's garage where someone was going to take me into a "coin" for goods.
The price of the gun, I got it on my place.
Victor Baranets in military observator
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller, but I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there we need to come, for example, by saying, "On the part of such a person who asked me to send that his daughter lost a teeth."
Now I even buy a couple of American pounds with a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it.
Small news are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried to be an illegal weapons buyer in the middle of the 1990s when he was prepared for an article on the subject.
The schemes, he, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "all we want."
"I believed in a luxe buck," remembers the military.
There's no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential client, I'm not pleased to buy, we're going with the forest seller and we're installing a target.
"Let me get out and when I'm convinced that the weapons work well, we're starting to negotiate, "describes the expert.
A bottle from his canapy
Search engines show sites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased "for different uses".
To this end, we do not need any document and nobody to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," it's written in public on the site "Buy a gun or a battery mitralet".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we're selling the minors?
"No permission, of course," asked the user "Ivan" (reserved spelling).
"Accept TT. Moscou", wrote "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a large network of false sites and has the desired persons to buy fighting weapons to the skin.
People run on food as famines and then exploiting carbon in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and ancient military
I have heard about this type of schemes: usually, the site is recorded out of the Russian laws field.
People take the orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic bowls.
"He returns a photo and instructions indicating where the weapons are hidden," explains the secretary of the "Droit to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets states that by making a request on the site, we can find out without weapons and behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a large network of false sites and has the desired persons to buy fighting weapons to the skin.
"The people run on food as famines, and then they get to exploit carbon in Siberia," he said.
A Makarov for $100
Buying an illegal fire weapons, the experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a weapon", we can buy a Makarov gun for $100.300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It has been out of long-term entries through the direction of these average storage engines.
According to the official data of the Minister, compared to the period of January-October 2011, the number of these crimes had been reduced by 7 per cent in Russia and was 22.9 billion, while the cases of flight and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosive substances and bombs were decreased by 7.8 per cent.
United States: Fast Food and Supermarketing employees are increasing
Nearly a fourth of the American teenagers passed by a caisse work at McDonald's
In these last days, a protest wage has been set up against the lower salaries practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentity Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict if this vague will take the width or slow quickly.
These actions are supported by the syndicates and a number of left.
Parallelly to the employment of modesty salaries that receive basic salaries in Walmart and in rapid restoration chains, demonstrations organizers want to create syndicates.
This sector is not for the instance covered by the syndical movement.
46 cents per year?
The manifestations started last week, after thanksgiving, the "Blue Vendredi", when a lowly rain of salts appeared to millions of residents were baptized in America and sometimes deceived scatters.
On that day, some Walmart company salaries, who work in the world 2,2 million people, left their job to organize green pickets with syndicates and left activists in the company stores whose products are destinated to consumers of modesty and medium-sized classes.
Walmart markets all: beds to chasing areas by car bacteria, aspirators, eggs and milk.
Products are averagely 8% to 27% less lower than in large supermarkets.
That is why many bad salaries in Walmart make their courses only on their workplace.
The price and choice of products made of Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to the critics, Walmart may be allowed to sell its good market products in particular because of low sales of his employees.
These lasts also face hard work conditions, such as the lack of driving cars or portal scanners.
Participants of the "Black Vendredi" demonstrations asked a increase in salary, they claimed that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic salaries at Walmart that touches $9.5 for hour, it is a sum that it can't be allowed.
Scientists of the Californian University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost $3,2 billion.
It is 1,1% more than it currently costs.
If Walmart had transferred all the payments on consumers' ears, each course in the magazine would return to them to 46% more.
They will cost only $12.39 more than now in one year.
The Walmart partys welcomely note that protests have occurred in only nine states and have no damage to the group.
The Black Vendredi continued in the 8-hour magazines on midnight next day and Walmart sold 5000 articles on the second.
His boxes have completed 100 million transactions for the Black Vendry.
The portfolio of the Dan Fogleman company assured in an interview on the left Huffington Post site that in all "minder than five" salaries of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was only a "operation of as many other" from the organizational syndicat.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not even concerned with Walmart magazines (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet implanted) but McDonald's and other good market restaurants.
McDonald's announced to sell billions of parts and then they don't even give you a sickness and pay you the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the municipal Council of New York
Currently, the minimum payment provided by the federal legislation and the new York is $7.25 for the hour.
Short-feeds increase them with time, but shortly, in the meantime, their base employees touch $8,90 for the hour.
No one touchs less than they in this city.
For me, it's unconceived to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a fourth of the American teenagers worked at McDonald's after the school lived with their parents.
Some people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find me to interview McDonald's salaries who are pleasing to live with this salary and sometimes have to eat their children with.
Otherwise, on the Wall Street Journal forum we find comments that it is unresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to eat them.
The demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday at 6 hours near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue requested that fast-feed boxers and kitchens be paid at least $15 per hour, or a multipliation of more than two times than the current minimum salary.
They also asked about the development of syndicates in the rapid restoration sector.
The American law prohibited the administration to prevent and punish the protestants of a syndical by brimades or licences.
However, their administration rarely simplifys their life.
For a syndicat, the quick restoration remains a difficult task, and this is for concrete reasons.
One of the mains is the extraordinary rotation of the staff.
They're not agreed.
Other tumultuous manifestations had nearly several other rapid restoration strings.
The fair time of the protest was the racing in the middle of the day nearby McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including Jumaane Williams, member of the municipal Council, who said, "McDonald's announced to sell billions of parts and then they don't even give you any illness and pay you the work you have done honestly!"
The demonstrants were supported by other new-Yorkaian democrats, in particular by the candidate to Mrs Bill De Blasio, who said that "we all must support the salaries of the quick restoration so that they receive a righteous salary and the economic welfare that deserves every New Yorkian.
The New York Times characterized this manifestation as the most important that he knew the quick restoration sector in all his history.
But just a few hundred cents of people have participated in it without acknowledge that they were not all fast-feed salaries, which worked for tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is hard to say if this mass movement label will make small.
"For the moment, it's only going to be in the middle of the brain."
Lastly, the fans of the news have been used to understand the reality increased through special lanetes.
In the past, it was Google who denied this was his current model during his annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, he shows the maintenance with the director of the interactive 3D group of the Microsoft de Cambrie laboratorium, Shahrram Izadi, which for the scientists of this society, the lunettes are already of the ancient history.
They are tried by the prospect of manipulating objects in the air of clouds, by creating open spaces.
- Can you tell us what your research group does?
- We work on interaction between human and machine and try to expand the borders of this interaction at the same time.
The humanity in its enemy remained for the time at the pixels on the plat and sometimes on the tactile.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and become radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors constitute a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the gesture.
- What's the future for us too?
- Although the Kinect has made the interaction, many things are running on platan, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for instant, is not really.
We are trying to change this and we work on actually 3D image systems that work on different areas, including projections.
We need to make the informatic world out of our world, in the world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, not only the user must be identified but also the space around it.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world by practical objects in a more practical form.
And to start, let's get out of these stupid reality cask!
- What do you think of the vocal command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she sure?
It cannot be said that it is the pause: the question of confidentiality is because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in his neck.
For example, to command the devices in public places, we had a project for which we pensioned to gestes, not to wide gestures, but rather to discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestes were not captured by the camera of the camera, but by a bracelet wearing the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoryly possible to reduce it to the size of an hour.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: geste + voice.
- That's what you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this cane?
You'd do it with the word and the gestes.
- Of course, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adapt on the basis of what the machine can or not do at a given time?
- Not obligatory, but it's a mutual approach.
I think we must work very closely in the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to identifie human reactions better.
For example, it may act as laser sensors, they produce a very good resolution in depth, and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not love in modern cameras?
Are they missing resolution, deepness or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based on our work on 3D.
It would obviously be good about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of matrice and depth.
In comparison to this last point, all current abilitys are sufficiently good, which is the work for the concepters of algorithms.
Resolution of the X and Y axes must be kept in mind, but also Z.
The speed also is very important, the number of frames to the second.
Human movements are sufficiently dynamic, and the 30 c/s are actually not enough, especially for gestes.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond Laboratorium, gave to the sensors a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, and the current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone doesn't understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need an apparatus of this type in my work, but it doesn't need to touch, to have more frames at the second.
- But don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect has three cameras today, whose one is actually a infrared issuer and the second, a recipient of the signal.
And the third camera is actually a habitual sensor of the field.
It does not serve to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or empire it by increasing the required calculation volume.
It would be interesting in creating a similar supreme product in Kinect, playing with the camera corbe and seeing how it could help to define locations.
- As I remember, Microsoft, at the Google Difference, didn't present his lunetts to the public.
Do you not think that, in a view of the daily use of the actuality's increased reality, the lunettes are one of the platforms that present the most prospective?
- Of course, prolonging the whole time with a smartphone the lifted hands are not practical but this is what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitional" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass lamps to the smartphone.
The lunettes are a very personal device and this makes their strength (the personal elements are those you're the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from lunettes will not allow you to work on objects in relation to others.
- Imagine an instinct that the manipulation of holographic objects in the air is more accessible than to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which the opposers to this idea point the finger: there is no tactile feeling!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group prepare in comparison with this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh perceived interaction between human and machine.
I think the eighth could be very well the tactical feelings.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to use image support.
She records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also lows that are actually intended to allocate the depthability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonal rayons directed to a specific point where the finger is located and that gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, of a air suffle on the bottom of the fingers.
There are also bracelets on poignets that affect the nervous terminals of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to hit the brain?
Does he believe that he feels what he normally should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is still a job there below on which it will still have to be wrong: the way to believe someone who is able to find it in a very small space that he walks in an open space almost finin - we work on the concepts of the courses (nothing to see with those in the fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also gentle bullets.
For the moment, it is only possible by means of the throwing the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes work on reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in absolute condition of fecondation.
The Government of Go and not the Culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the "The Pre-Garde of Petersbourgeois" project dedicated to citizens who are in front of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already received eminents of the artistic scene of Saint-Petersbourg whose performance go beyond the town's border and who have found a employment in Europe after they have been joined throughout Russia.
The new heroes of "Rosbalt" is the extraverse penetration of Kirill Miller.
All the city knows Kirill Miller, this man instead of barbu, all red clothing that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the East Garden or even at the festivals and vernissages.
Cyril Miller's tables always raise the crowds, whatever is their exhibition.
It is one of the physician petersbourgeoes contemporaryly social and philosophy, one of the founders of the new mythes.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the forward petersbourgeois of the end of 1980s and the beginning of 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants ridicule and makes them a good humor.
Recently, he took in his hands an orgue of Barbary and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersbourg because he had enough mature for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you park the city in red and not in yellow or turkey blue, for example?
- I chose the red as a specialised couturier in the aspect and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between painting, image creation and society.
Even if in the society, everything that is not grass survive the aggressiveness and negative agitation.
But my challenges are intended to start the debate.
All the story of my provocative actions is a invitation to discuss.
- And when did you realize that you should be penitent?
- In the exhibition of the Palace of the Nevskiy culture where my jobs were.
I realized that it was my way.
So the vague of old non-official pieces was passed, and the new, free, in my kind, were incomprehensible.
I started associating friendship with the points of the new vague, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no wage.
I'm interested in the theater, in mode, music, all kinds other than words.
And all this was found in your artistic Clinics... - It was important for me to find me in the centre of the Culture of Saint-Petersbourg where the best creation forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10 who opened before the travel a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the petersbourgeoise boheme.
Many are born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour come with the "Van Gogh ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easily play-back songs in moving maillots, and they counted among them Igor Vdovin, as a modern player today.
When the group began to happen alive, he became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg did not hurt emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and then his great career started, but his training and basic education is with us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Griboeiedov Club: these are the effects of the artistic Clinic.
Our employees went out there as a habitual.
I'm a hero of the past century, from the time when culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, an investigation was organized in the press: it was the price of "The personalities of our city".
I was called "Pentra of the Year" and then my kingdom ended.
It is not able to work in a new time with ancient rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your travels are characterized by a possible.
- Many of my tables are hits, they have a very strong currentity and accuracy.
I'll have a planned exhibition "The Russian Museum through clowns".
The clowns belong to an intellectual category.
Before I was someone of the social, it's wrong today, and it's afraid to be like this.
But with clowns, everything gets clear, the tragic falls.
I love the big, I have big ideas.
For example, the idea of rescuing the world through the total and obligatory destruction.
Today, it's the habit that is important, we're interested in external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him the hand, but we're supposed to put him in the box.
And the lie will be removed by the disgusting.
- Recently we have seen you in the role of Barbary's orgy player. - A cultural city must have such heroes.
Who else I can play it.
- But maybe the commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today the commercial art must be treated, delicated, liquorous.
A disintegration of culture is being produced.
Before, people were divided into sheep, the bohem partyers loved one thing, the neighbors of another.
Today, everything is divorced in micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 currency to please everyone.
Today, we need to think about who you're gonna like.
Everyone sees 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhaijlov!
- It's people we've threw out who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that walks.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and at the end of the account is less management, money, all loss.
I've got my fans, the main is not to find them, not to throw the v.
When I was young, I took the tables that a collector across Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that are habitually those that we pick at the end of life.
Today, we often confund the ideas.
It is said that there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
The consumption has no culture, it doesn't have anything to see.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the pieces that lived in poverty and died in poverty and who were just money for penting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in Saint-Petersbourg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the cultural officer.
But everyone can't work in culture.
Under the government of good tsars, it was not like this, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they realized that it had to keep the good experts.
In Moscou, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in Saint-Petersbourg who could be experts, but they are separated, because there are higher experts who will evaluate these experts correctly and break their way.
Currently, it's the "Reign of Go" that flows.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they honestly say that they do not take all the modern art, that there are points that must be other museums.
- For you, what's Saint-Petersbourg?
- Saint-Petersbourg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a land for this.
And on our stones, the art's bad to push.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, it's wrong.
In Europe, there are many interesting people who will see expositions, concerts.
In our house, this bed is very fine.
We must make the art the way it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project made with the support of Saint-Petersbourg
Hide in Space
The earth is in danger.
Climate refreshment or disturbance with a steroid diet.
Space vessels with lands on board are looking for a secure planet.
In order to save mankind, a big question is: How can we continue to make our species as an appointment or even on a plane of sugars?
I don't think there's a lot of choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, it would be only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," Vladimir Sourdine, leader of the State Institute of P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more adapted to life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can live there only at a very high height or on the orbit of Venus... in the space.
We began to interest in the issues of reproduction in the space by focusing on the flower.
A half-year-old years ago, there were experiences on plants.
Four generations of small wheat cultivated on orbits did not distinguish any way from the earthly varieties.
Then, we have put on orbits of insects, small tremendous mouches.
In 1979, cattle eggs were sent to the space to see how an emissor was developed.
We're getting a powder at the outside, actually normal.
It's then the problem starts.
"The problem is linked to the fact that the powder must find a support, it must be put on its patts and start moving ", explains the director of the Laboratorium of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Scientific Academy (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
With no support, the powder acted in a disordered manner.
And at the end of 10 hours, the newborn saw their instincts completely attracted.
The powder did not respond to the light or the sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die at the end of four days.
"We downloaded their eyes twice, then we left, because it is simply impossible to work with them there ", explains Vladimir Sychev by detecting the failure of experience with poultry in the space.
The last biological "miniature" ark with animals has been sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experience will be continued at the preliminary 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only be on ships of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus in the space.
In principle, there was nothing surnatural.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. We need to do this type of research, " notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their generation.
Nevertheless, we are not yet able to play directly in the space.
That's not a bad case.
In their habitual environment, animals are not able to carry out their sexual instinct.
In contrast to animals, man is able, in principle.
Homo ́ens has abstract thought, he is able to create a convenient emotional fund.
This type of experience is not performed for ethical reasons.
But women are going to the space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female humme is what humanity has more value.
Our mouth was involving, and no one could say if he would stay after a flight in the space.
If she could give birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Va日nadzé, retraction from the area and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight in the space, the first cosmonauth woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaiev was also cosmonaute.
In 1988, the second cosmonauth woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been two times on orbit and even worked in an extra vehicle, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk is lost.
We have little, even very little cosmonautes who have not had anything and who give birth to a whole healthy seed after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaute, the Soviet Union's heroes and Russian heroes, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humankind must seek new solutions in bio-eyees, protection against radiations and creation of artificial gravity.
Laboratory of the Cosmonaute Preparation Centre: obligatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in nulle flotability, cosmonautes are involved in extra vehicle outputs.
The water imitates the accommodator.
If for adults, water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for food, it is their real element.
The small men amâbies confirm that life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby develops about 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of his mother's wheat, it is easier for him to stay in water.
It is in principle logical, because from his birth to his first bathroom, it is only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the Natation Instructor for Food, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just born the accuser is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, weight force.
Instead, the muscles of the ventre, the bassin is very quickly atrophing, the ability to push the baby is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by pressing on the accommodation simulators.
Of course, we can prepare a shooting in a special room, and the woman will make it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite to consider this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If he doesn't feel the earth's attraction, the emblem doesn't form the squelet or the muscle system.
You can't buy a food as a adult with a special combination for trains.
He will just be private for his live needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in an alien environment will come back to the Earth of a mandicated child, completely disappointed, "predicts the Committee's Bioetics of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Scientist Academy, Igor Pestov.
Birthing of children in the space still leads to the theory.
However, with time this will become reality, when the Terriens will come into their ships to a far planet that will become the habit of their seed in the space.
The head of the ISC (Govern Finance Control Institute) stated: "the control of the independent pseudo work (in Czech " Swarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public markets, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and a quality legislation, but it is on the trail for its application.
That was what Miloslav Kala, the President of the Supreme Institute for Finance Control in an interview for Currently.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, it is what makes weak among us," Kala said in his comment on the present situation.
A joint control of Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
It quotes as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Swarc system " by Peter Nevertime.
Mr Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS was not able to import undertakers with controls; is it permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in a way or in another way, so if it prohibits something, even the Government leader can prevent the action of a charged authority to inspect the respect of the law," Kala states.
During the meeting of the Committee on Control at the House of Members, you have called on a Czech-German project in the context of which the public market legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was the question specifically?
It's a parallel control we've launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, the European legislation provides how to manage public markets and specific national legislation as well as a practice that has been said to it.
We have gathered all of this and although this control procedure is not yet finished, we have very interesting differences: us usually speaking, our legislation may be "there and better quality", however, some parameters, the practice as this is better in Germany.
This, therefore, confirms that it is not sufficient to continually develop more detailed rules but that it is necessary to be dedicated to the implementation of the law.
What can this project help you concretely, and what does it result for you?
A common control of this type should just contribute to what we stopped to strive to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the levels, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means the matter to a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lower) to exclude any enrichment and eventual activity.
However, by reducing market levels, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so submerged by paperass, that those seeking the fails will find much more opportunities than if the level remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems on the implementation of public market legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an analogue institution to our ISC or a different organizational mode?
For institutions, like the ISC, the Bundesshof, which is organized in the same way, also has a little different advice, but these two institutions are similarly conducted .
Competitions are also similar, in a certain measure, with a nobleness compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has the accounts of this type at the level of different countries.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to State resources.
The public funds managed with us by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the countries' account courses.
In relation to national legislation, is it more simple than our?
I would not like to make a general comparison without specific data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designed as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better in all areas.
Is it possible that they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I don't have comparative data.
However, it must also be said that this country which we consider as a model is also confronted with a series of problems.
Otherwise, they would not have any benefit to cooperate with our institution, right?
With regard to national legislation, which has signed for you, as institution, the amendment of the law on public markets, have its effects already been felt?
This amendment has been entry into force relatively recently, and it has no effect on our control operations yet.
As we do back controls, we have to count with a certain delay.
Our observations are only related to the process of preparation of future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "detecting the risks of bad management" with which we have passed to the crystal of nearly 14,000 public markets - there these changes will be made clear, because the levels have been made and the conditions of certain types of calling procedures and soon.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather than as a benefit or as an overall charge for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm it.
The problem that may occur is that these rules become more serious and that it is not possible to respect them.
The provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) already contradicted the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of market law means a lack of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who do formal errors without consequence on the decision process.
Such a system will benefit from pressure on administration.
So what is the solution to get out?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS could not import undertakers with controls of the Swarc self-disting system - what does that mean?
Is the Swarc system prohibited or authorised?
The law must be applied in a way or in another way, so if it prohibits something, even the Government leader can prevent the action of a charged authority to take inspection and request the respect of the law.
He can say, "We will change the law and make it, but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was.
The market law conducts relatively strict rules on formalities to be fulfilled and, just in order to protect the call for offers.
However, it is tragic to eliminate a submissionary only because of formal failures.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just, and it is, in my opinion, what makes us defect.
The roads are in iron places, but most remain practicable.
In some places of the Czech Republic, the roads are geared and also injured.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased monitoring.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practicable this morning, but by yellow places and also angry.
The temperatures have fallen and covered between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should actually remont in the day.
The snow falls have stopped in the region and there is only a finishing snow bed in the plains.
However, the crops of the Metallifer Mountains (Krušné Hory) are covered by approximately 30 metres of snow.
The data of the regional road maintenance service show that, due to the brouillard, visibility was reduced.
The rapid R6 road and the national roads of the region are now practicable without difficulties.
However, monitoring remains to be placed, for example, on some points where the clothing can be frozen and glittered.
All departmental roads and third category paths, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
It remains on some of their shops of yellow snow residues and on places charged by traffic.
In particular in high-term areas, leaders must strengthen their monitoring.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Direction of Roads and Autoouts reports on his website that certain routes from East Bohemia are threatened by the training of glasses and that snow-sneaks that are broken by traffic can be found on the roads in the mountainous and high-height areas.
Road maintenance services maintain the drivers against the risks of training in the areas of Pardubice.
There may be a glass in the surroundings of Lanškroun, Usti nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Myto, and this, mainly on the departmental roads and the third category.
The routes I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly located in the Monts des Geants (Krkonosse) and the Monts de l'Aigle (Orlische Hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knie and Trutnov, a snow-sneaking box is presented on the roads in high-term areas.
In East Bohemia, the time will be safe today, most often degaged, with possible cloud passports.
It will suffle a low wind and the temperatures will usually dark between -3 ° and + 1° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads of the Pilsen region are currently practicable, even though, by places, it is necessary to demonstrate an increased monitoring and adapt its conduct to the weather conditions.
This morning, the temperatures are covered between -3 °C and -9 ° C.
After the latest snow falls and the refrigeration followed, some communication ways may be in iron places.
The drivers can expect to cross the brouillard areas, however, the visibility will be gradually improved.
This is the information of the regional road maintenance service.
D5 is practicable almost without difficulties, however, road communications services recommend an increased monitoring between 80 and 13 km.
The clothing of most of the national roads is safe and iron.
Some tronsions can be embraced in the district of Pilsen-Sud and the district of Tachov.
Departmental and third category roads are humid, and in this case the preservation of gelated tronctions is applicable.
The leaders must be watchful, especially on the less frequent roads of the region of Shumava.
Region d'Olomo
The drivers in the Olomo areas of high-scale areas today must be counted with a spacious and snow-sneack box on the roads.
This couch remains on the cow called "Chervenohorské sedlo" and on the road in direction of Videlský cruj, after chemical treatment operations.
Snow losses have been forced to keep the road staff on the ground this night; it has fallen more than three metres in the district of Shumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most of the chaos are practicable without difficulty.
" On the heights of the district of Shumperk there are snow residues.
Jesenik's leaders must wait to meet at the col "Chervenohorské sedlo" a spacious and molle snow box " has said to the CTK today the maintenance officer of the streets of Shumperk's district.
Their area of Jesenik also has been placed during the night; these last, after chemical treatment, are now degaged and moving, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomo, the roads are practicable without difficulty, however, in the district of Sternberk, the leaders should take care of in the forest areas of smooth chaussings.
Regions of Uzti na Labem and Liberec
Since this morning, the North Bohemic road maintenance services reported several difficult trials.
The police's data, which, in addition to some places covered by snow or glass, is closed by the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ustecku.
The temperatures will remain lower than zero height, so snow and glass should be kept on the roads. In the plains, especially south-east of Bohema's Central Plateau, there is no problem and roads usually are safe.
No difficulties have been reported for the present time.
The road maintenance services reported the presence of vergles, in particular in the Netherlands.
According to weatherologists, the night conditions were ideal to his training: rain and snow source during the day, degaged heaven and gel during the night.
In addition, since the main axes of employment, difficult conditions on national road 13 to the border between the regions of Usti na Labem and Liberec are reported.
The closure of the closure between Telnice and Kninice is due to trees that were covered under the weight of the snow until the shoes reached.
Simon Ornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think that in less than one month this should be the end of the world?
It's only one of these new alarmants, the type of pigs in which we love falling.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are increasingly saying that we are the only group capable of collecting a positive energy remaining in order to refuse or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going up a totally unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you make this project more detailed to our readers?
It's a charitable action we've been prepared for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing at the end of the calendar Maya year for 21 December to 11 hours of the morning.
The guard on 20 December, three concerts will be held at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will be completed practically at the time when Maya will finish the calent on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
In the past, I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Outside the fact that we want to collect sufficient energy to save the world, we also want to think about the world's condition that we leave our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including chaussures, T-shirts, sacs, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online on www.e-tap.ch people can also support us.
The Tap Tap Group with other interprètes has also recorded a hymne against the end of the world, named " The End of the World Cancelled " (Check " Final world zrusseno").
It's already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it in these charitable concerts?
Of course, at the end, if we succeed and that the end of the world doesn't happen...
It will be sing simultaneously by all interprents in the three concerts.
The hymnes will also be joined at a time given in the context of a direct, in fact unique television.
The words of this song were written by Tomás Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sing...
How are you coming to cooperate with them?
We have other characteristics of the Czech show-biz, because we organize many charitable concerts and events...
We strive to intensively participate in these projects.
The majority of them were interested in such a cooperation and that it was amusing them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equippe the Studeo training centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and whose work we have worked for the implementation in the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap, and this six years ago.
Teachers regularly come to the Jedličkuv Institute and offer them activities that are interested and amazing them.
Students themselves do not have the way to take courses, we are trying to help them in this way.
In the context of the conclusion of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project into a new independent building.
Should several groups of music and interplying go up on scene at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you selected them?
We tried to develop a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will ascend on Chinaski, Lesbiens Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchy.
You will find all details on www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare for other " mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the context of Prague's Presidency; there we will certainly prepare a quality programme with interesting invitations.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalists, for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscou.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of handicaped people.
How do you handle the organization and logistics of your turns?
It's not so terrible that it looks at the first side.
We have five electrical members whose engines have to travel in support, naturally we tribal also many baggage and instrument boxes....
Until everything had been more or less well done, the CHSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from which we have recently returned, everything has happened without problems.
Thanks to your travels to the foreign, you can compare what these countries differ from what is the facilities of access for minor mobility people, the attitude of the opinion regarding handicaped persons and soon.
What were your experiences until now?
At Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just been witnesses in Moscow that all are still in a initial phase.
In relation to Prague, Moscow is still very shortly accessible to handicaped people; there is still no harm that one moves himself in the city centre.
They have not yet considered a evidence of giving priority to a person in a disgust.
Happy, there is also an effort to draw attention to the problems of handicaped people is being created.
In what other ways should we ratify the most developed countries?
There are many things for which we are still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and perfections are always involved in efforts taken by the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, people with a bad handicap move themselves alone in the public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not even very often there that many handicaped people actively participate in social life, on this point you, The Tap Tap, are rather than the point of progress!
The respect of public and access facilities is a thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we will have sports, artists, actors, politicians or famous jurists.
For this time, there are only cases isolated of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, we're back for a few years, what has moved you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as teacher at the Jedlička Institute, where I found a lot of young people ready to invest in something.
And as I am myself musician (I play, among other things, of saxophone), with an age, we have created a musical activity.
And then, with time, as our Moderator Ladja Angelovič said, we have lost a little the control of the situation (rires).
The success has occurred only in the last years, if I don't miss it?
It is true, the fact that we have linked with songs with and work actively to promote the group has helped us.
We realized that if a job is not ­ it is as if it does not exist in the fund.
Thanks to the subventions of the European Union, we can also enable us to have quality teachers, equipment, and soon.
Do you want to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of things that copy each other.
In a certain way, it is logical: all that is new is accepted with density and it takes a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I think Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally mercy, it's natural ...
But mercy is totally unusual, because people with a handicap are not suffering, abandoned of all, which we must be pityful.
These are people who can live a whole life and enjoy themselves, if they have the necessary means of certainty.
I often say that when people with a handicap come to do something, it is not just a progress for them but for the whole society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a requesting leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransistant in many areas and require a certain discipline.
But I think it's actually normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to repeateds two times a week, follow the preparation courses and pass a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this works the same way in each group who wants to work and reach goals.
The Tap Tap group has currently 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
One one, Lady Angelovich.
We're a open group, people come in and go, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or want to join us.
This will be the case of the scheduled day watch at the end of the world on Thursday 20 December 2012 from 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in Incheba, Brne in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual reliefs when the song of the Tap Tap group " The End of the Cancelled World " will be played together.
The purpose of the concert is to raise financial means (25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional study centre in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a billet at this concert is 400 CZK, the input is free for children up to 12 years, the prevention of the billets is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and cosmos.
The last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was approved as a twenty-year member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former East block (the Czech Republic has become a member of the whole 12 November 2008).
Poland has started closely with the ESA in 1994 and during the following years have participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
However, the road of Poland to the space has started much earlier.
Before the Second World War, passionate Polandians worked on space flights; they did not always meet understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to the Conference of A. Sternfeld to the Astronomy Observatory of Varsovie on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his forward-guard book entitled " Introduction to Astronautic".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left cold auditors and years later, Sternfeld reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his works.
In 1934, Sternfeld obtained the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Astronautic Introduction".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) then became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautic.
He wrote hundred cents of articles in the Poland journals and wrote many books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of the global rename astronautical, and its contribution has been particularly replaced by the fact that his name was given to one of the hidden faces of the Moon.
Since 1925, a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a fused engine.
Unfortunately, the author or the details of this project are not known.
It's not even if the fuse should be used to propulse or fresh the dressine.
The only information known on this drain is the pressure of the time.
Since 1933, the Poland artillery began to sanctify the fuses.
The research was conducted by the Commission Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in relation to Professors Miečislaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrickiego.
It shows documents contained that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the German armies' array, research has been interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photo-electric chasing fusy, drawn by the Rohoziński engineer, appeared in the specialized press and the next year was published by a author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects finally had a military use of fuses engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of the fuses technology were conducted by the provisional Scientific Consultive Committee ("Timczesowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy"), coordinating all travels.
This committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other aircraft travels were held in the Poland press through the Poland Astronautic Society (Polski Astronautic Society).
For the first time, it is questioned of a company in November 1954 of the problem journal, in which four more detailed articles are listed in the airport.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotovicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to the astronautic
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been set up, and it was that the area of space research had the future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has developed efforts to enter the international astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and since the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first President of the PTA, Kazimet Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He keeps his function until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the coroned development of the RM weather fuse (Rakieta Meteorologicna), which became the first Poland for scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch was held on 10 October 1958.
This range of 1800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighted a little less than 5 kg.
Afterward, a improved version, RM-1A, was built and, during the age of 1959, two stages of RM-2 was launched in the Bledov desert.
This fuse had a length of 1,4 metres and was probably weakened 11,5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific travels - the RM-34 range should have a port of up to 14,5 km and serve to watch the wind at the height.
But in 1963, all development travels were stopped.
The Meteor-1 range was set up during the period 1962-1965, successful to the first RM-type fusions.
This fuse, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and a weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved to scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A range had a range of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B the volume was 0.34 litres and 0.62 litres in Meteor-1C.
The maximum port of all these types of engine was 37 km.
In the 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 zones were placed in the Aeroplane Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 range had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg at a height of approximately 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
The entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 should be mentioned and the establishment of a CoSPAR national committee two years later.
In the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in the Space Exploration on Artific Soviet satellites and, in 1978, Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second non-soviet cosmonaute of this programme after Vladimir
The abrogation of the law on use travels is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court violated the law on use travels.
This decision raised in the opinion of a living debate.
It is no doubt interesting in considering this problem of a widely larger viewpoint.
The economic systems oriented to liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more non-regulated economic competition.
This specifically means that different economic entities and national economic systems are permanently in conflict with each other.
This results of the principle of freedom of trade and freedom (without limited limits) of the private capital associated with an expensive financial speculation.
The significant differences in the price of work (salaries) generate a pressure on prices.
The following meaning should be made: a producer is effortsed by the import of lowly sold goods to resist economic competition by making the price of the competitor in order to remove a larger part of the market and thus carry out its own benefits.
In large scale, this means for most enterprises: transfering the production to the foreign or buying the low price or disappearing.The result is an important unemployment in countries where the prices are higher than other economics.
Since the private capital does not have any responsibility for social views and also for responsibility for the purpose of unemployment, the social charges of the State are needed to increase.
All of this situation intensifys the perfectly bad will of the employees to pay taxes and thus acquire economic and social damage caused by this course to benefit.
This situation is in such a notority point that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
In the various economys, non-scrouping practices of the private capital cause a situation in which the governments of different countries are obligated to start in a mutual competition in order to artificially delay the social level of their own population in order to attach the foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments make their own population grateful to the private capital without taking into account social fraud.
This appears mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The goal is to constrain its own population economically to accept the dictate of private capital prices, in particular in the area of salaries.
This is a part of a system of economic restrictions in the case of long-term unemployment and otherwise by the restriction of the loan rights in the field of work legislation.
It results in a growing poverty and increasing differences between the rich and the poor.
In the RFA, there are years of food distribution points for poor people who cannot submit their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
In the context of the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes absolutely coerent that the salaries receive such salaries that the State seems to pay a supplement to achieve the minimum vital.
For example, such a scandale was updated in the case of salariers working as assistant to the federal parliament.
The economy measures of nearly all EU Member States of the southern European Union, without doubt, generate an analogue situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic evaporation of the society, people are obligated to emigrate (as in the 19th century), or to live with misfortune salaries, in terms of society, in the hope that the private capital once invested in their countries.
Here we need to ask: Where will this capital come from?
If there comes from other EU countries, poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Marokko, a Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also concerns the whole Latin America.
The liberal theory and media claim that the State cannot invest in its own economy, that the management economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regular interventions.
We should then ask if the private capital does not influence and, even today, does not guide its own egoist interests, politics, and by the same way, the whole State.
The answer to this question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is a presumptuous lobby in all States.
It results in a disappeared situation in the field of corruption, by granting mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is condamnable but not punishable.
In the RFA, the situation is like that, due to the lack of financial means, national ministers delegate the development of law projects with closely related lawyers to the industry.
These legislative projects are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The whole power comes not from the people, as the western constitutions say, but of powerful financial groups using their own interests.
It is evident that the democracy oriented to Liberalism is now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman empire at the time of Caesar and Pompea": "The State has been in full diligence and the functions have been attributed to violence.
Put-de-vine coups, illegally obtained benefits, and stones and swords were also used for ✔ these posts.
The sub-table and corruption would proliferate without limits and the people would have come to elections with already sold voices" ... "The honest people were not looking for anything for functions, it resulted once the State remained 8 months without consules." "The people really started to say that the medication to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it had to choose a powerful man"... It is true that Appians had the mind of Pompea, but it is César who was irreversiblely transformed the democracy into absolute regime.
Finally, as in the past, the current society is based on the preference of personal benefits, without regard to the interest of the society in its own.
In its importance, the private capital is no longer able to understand and make the interests of the company in its own.
This results today, as sometimes, a deficiency without elite, without any effort to make deep reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergency of fascist and steadfast regimes in liberalisation without scrupules of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.
In the present state of things, the loss of these systems can be considered to benefit liberal democracy as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in life, the humanitarian and social crisis that we are today, as well as crimes against mankind as we know them from the ancient and recent history.
The abrogation of the law on use travels is not a solution, at least long-term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and at European internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to reduce the population's social level.
This trend is actually systemic.
The solution consists of sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen State capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital monopol in the society to the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos workshop.
"Nothing will come out of violence and never can" says Sting in the Fragile song whose main verse of refrain is "not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would not be there," said Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza's band, such as habitual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take the Israeli party, arguing his right to self-defense and puting the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, calling on the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I don't want to consider the question of knowing who is guilty and who is victim in his currencies of repeated murder; all of the current people of Israel, including those of the autonomous territory, have been born in this political situation and have not seen the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer to the readers a viewpoint "back the ride" on the one that mainly benefits from pressures that have been lost for more than 95 years (in 1917 from the Balfour statement) in a small part of the Middle-East country.
Some of these reflections are supported on historical facts available to the study, others are my own understanding of it, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of the modern history.
The story of mankind is first the story of a fight for power.
Each time, we can find an Alexandre the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is to know whether these individualities acted independently or whether they acted on the throne to someone who managed their acts in accordance with previous objectives defined.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world's riches are placed between the hands of some individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to do during a single generation.
Astronomy wealth is particularly different from the Rothschild family, which could be considered as the head of the skin (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
It's not written about them.
Of course.
Since the 90s of the 19th century, they have gained the first World Press Agency (Reʹs) to end the establishment of links between their names and serious acts of elsewhere to which they were misled and which had always signed for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their strength or both.
They have major participations in nearly the majority of the world's central banks and prepare or lead wars against countries where they have no such participations yet (before Afghanistan's invasion, the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after Kadhafi's distortion only 4, Russia placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the Russian Government).
Everyone who tried to stand against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln repeated the state of central bank at the Bank of America of the Rothschild and began to issue his own money during the civil war (governmental, I'm well) and was held in a teater in 1865.
JFK began to issue the own money and wanted to solve the FED, he was released in 1963, and Mr. Louis McFadden was empoisoned in 1936, while he wanted to try a trial against the FED for the great economic crisis of 1929.
In 1859 to 1871, their seat of world power led to the forming of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33th degree-making franc-making, which is the highest level.
The first war had a goal for the great statistical monarchies of Europe, the second had to remove the colonialism, including the British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (as such a number of servants is sufficient for their luxe and comfort), creating a unique universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing else than the start of such a solution) and finally obtaining an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschilds are to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chaos - the order followed by the chaos).
These solutions are fake and are always leading to an increase in the situation (see the creation of the FED to avoid that the crisis as they caused in 1907).
After succeeding the first world war by Sarajevo of Ferdinand, inheritant Habsbourg at the Austrian-Hungrian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by providing Bolchevic revolution.
The First World War ended brushfully with a German capital without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the Morcellisation of Austria-Hungria, the Central European power.
For a easier decline from the Second World War, the banks have allowed the politicians to create a Latvian conflict situation: they have, on the other hand, imposed to Germany of Pharamineus war reparations generating the conditions of radicalization of the applause mass (their then sufficed to put a sufficient powerful leader, showing the right of criminals, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they create a Czechoslovaquia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority that had to play the role (which actually holds) of the fifth column to put the fire to the pounds and decline a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of sionist movement, one of them reflected the creation of a Jewish state, of preferences in the history of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).
The above statement of Balfour placed the bases of a massive migration to Palestinian and the first fractions with the Arabic local population as they had.
Terrorist acts were made by part and else.
The Second World War was exclaimed; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international banks first had held it; or if everything he had done was planned, however, the fact is that the souffrances of Europe in concentration camps created the bases of the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; as the war reforms imposed in Germany were from the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel allocated an incidence home that could cause a third world war.
If the international banks come to run this war, the Jewish population will be like it during the Second World War, the first victim of fighting, this time as the Arabic or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a large labor, the source of discourse and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (he sufficed to see how people divide themselves closely between partisans and defenses of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a torture causes another torture, a circle of violence without end, and where, in the origin of all, the cupidity of some individuals and their desire to gain power over the world?
There is a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as we have, international banks offer people to elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascinating political, loyal to international banks, which makes everything to deal with war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Chinese, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) spread to become a global conflict and, since Iran controls the detriment of Ormuz through which it transites 20% of all the world oil (the naval corridor has only a wide range of two thousand) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
Under what light now appears the proposals made by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a pound of financing aristocrats is used by the rest of the population huma.
A world in which any newborn seems to be implanted at birth a electronic puzzle that makes it completely controlled.
"Let all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and servants be put on the hand or the front of a red iron mark, so that he cannot buy or sell the one who doesn't bring the name of this fever beast or the number of his name.
We need to understand: that he who has a good sense takes into account the numbers of this fever beast.
This number draws the man and it's six hundred sixty-six."
The Argo movie: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a multitude of islamist students was acquired of the American ambassade of Teheran and had 52 diplomates.
They should be released in exchange of Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration of positive results, but it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would have severely distorted the confidence of its aliens in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had risen on the establishment of a teocratic regime, it was not able to be released.
It was a hard course for the bridge of the United States, even later aggravated by the fiasco attempt to release the ottes by force.
The sequestrated diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
Their outcome leads to the United States a weight of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling.
The Iranian debt contributed strongly to Jimmy Carter's defeat towards Ronald Reagan to the 1980 presidential elections.
The Argo movie, of the actor and stagger in scene Ben Affleck, describes a episode of this story that offers a small winning in America.
Just before she was busy, six employees disappeared from the ambassade.
According to complex periods, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In the context of the Canadian authorities, the  Capulet made them out of Iran through a rocambolic cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tournament team to make repairs for the tourning of a film with a great science-fiction spectacle.
Genre Combination
The Tony Mendez exfiltration expert's plan requires Hollywood's employment.
In order to make the more reliable, specialized magazines have been reported on this project, press conferences were organized and a real officer production company.
The details of the operation remained secret, since the film was based on Tony Mendez's memories.
The Affleck movie is an insolite combination of several types.
It is a part of a political thrilling designed in realistic way but also a "copper movie", the story of a successful time, a trade - such as in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
Environments are successful: Sequences of Teheran de documentary (in subtitled sequences are presented in iconic photographs of the events and the way these photos have been translated into the movie, there are no large differences)
Moreover passports in Hollywood, treated with ironie and a little exageration,
And then scenes of the General Quarter of the ✔ and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in phones and phones...
Ben Affleck has succeeded to rename his career in a famous way.
A ridiculated actor, he became a respected scene player and his actor's game stopped to submit ironic comments.
Argo is its third long-meter after the "Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first film of Affleck who doesn't play in his city of origin, Boston.
The sense of a place's atmosphere is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also shows this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Teheran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are rolled in streets when rebuilding real facts; the initial sequence of the ambassade fall is impressive by its clearness, which also suggests confusion and invisibleness when soon, in a given place, is written a history page.
Affleck and its employers have an analogue effect on the fictivity scenes (the fake tourning team in the Teheran baser).
Too many actions too many places
The scene mechanism had to be satisfied with a subject that offered only a few palpitant scenes, in the meaning of the term.
It goes very well, he sometimes repeat some elements in reality and there, the result is not even electrically (the scene in which the crisis threat at the Teheran airport is separated by a phone shot in America, and the continuation on the trail of aterrist is sufficiently carried out by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lives in its dismissed character, must have shown too many events too different.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are really charming in their role of Hollywoodian partners, their persons would have deserved a larger place and they are not, far away, the only in this case.
The Affleck movie misses a little dramatic pressure, it leaves to see with a moderate interest, appreciating the performance and retraction of the 70s.
He brings the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of another story, in a certain way, unfinished at this day, and as an illustration of the exagated character of the representation of secret services as all-powerful and all scientists, he does the case.
Rules for balls, bananas and circles
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who is conducting an examining of the most absurd costs each year, has now decided to launch the concours of the regulation or ideas from the "EU-Atlier" most absurd.
"The fact that the EU intends to adopt a quota of 40 percent women for the direction of the large European undertakings was from the origin of our decision," said for the journal Pravo, Patrik Nader.
In the case of the absurdities mentioned, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to join insurance premiums for men and women.
However, until now, women were prejudiced to the tariffs of life insurance because they represented, objectively, a less risk for insurance companies.
People can signal until the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU atelier".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nader informed.
In the EU's controversed regulations, for example, the obligation to acquire bio components to fuel, which has damaged consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of use of the trustworthy thermometers to mercure, only because they contain a relatively low quantity of a dangerous substance or the Directive on the size of the powder chains, which caused the egg prices to be obtained.
Criticals have also been issued by the past against the prohibition of using the expression "buurry to tartin" or the return of the sale of classic ampoules.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 metres.
The European Administration often acts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defensed in Brussels by a State or a group of States (hereinafter the Czech Republic presents the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups, for example, are that bananas should not be under 14 cm or have a "anormal cover" in the Union.
The European Commission was defensed by argumenting that it was only to harmonize non-homogeneous national standards that comply with trade.
The standards regarding fruit and vegetables have been approved despite the opposition of certain States, which suggest that existing directives lead to food-building.
The first price can be determined in this investigation in the EU Regulation of the last year, which must contain a warning on the bulbs that indicates that children of less than 8 years should not fail without oversight of adults.
The EU has referred to an American investigation, which is the first cause of children's death by suicide among the games.
Similar restriction is applied to children less than 14 years of age for suffling in furniture trompets.
We also have wonderful ideas in our home.
The following rules on European staff themselves are absolutely absurd: due to the ability of this topic for Greece, any person who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedone" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia of 日a).
In terms of the "Laissez Faire" with liberal economy, the banko ́poplatky.com server named in this investigation, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the Czech Republic.
The EU had fixed maximum volumes for food reserves that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our access to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for the containing and risking campaigns.
The organisations of this investigation considered interestingly the idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of granting a subvention to request granting subventions.
However, these ideas are not originating in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we do not have a sea handicap.
We will ask the European Union for a refund." This was the Minister for Agriculture of the day Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
It claimed that, in fact, our production of vegetables, and after the purchases called "interventionists", the State was found with full stocks that he had to be exported afterward.
According to Palas, the EU should have payed millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far away from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a call for the purchase of food from countries without maritime access.
Subventions for obtaining subventions have been proposed to communs by the Minister for Local Development, managed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), those of which, concretely, serve to provide requests for subventions granted by Brussels.
The EU says, "The strange regulations are rare."
If regulations are often critical in the Member States, many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the field of its general development deserve awareness.
More serious, for example, experts are the problem of the use of EU subventions for projects that have nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States during budgetal negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, as in other countries of the Union, is due to the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which does not always be winners) in the Czech Republic in Brussels.
If at the end of six years of battle against Germans and Austrians, the Czech Republics had successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tarhaltky" for the call "Tuzemski rum" that came to us in the 19th century, our producers were forced to replace it by the name "Tuzemak".
Only products based on cancer sugar alcohol, and not based on betterave sugar, can have the name of rhum.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, it is now found in company of frageges globally known as la Feta or le Gorgonzola, le massepain de Lübeck or du jambon de Parme, les biscuits de Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské sauary"), les carpes de Pohorélice et de Tréboński capr and the houblon de Žatec.
The pain d'epice de Pardubice ("Pardubisk pernik") and the gateaux called "Cornets de Horíce" ("horische trubičky") can also be proud of their Community mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm only an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr Senator, how do we have the idea of presenting the presidential elections?
It's not to be a Senator or a president who accounts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I have no longer support to see how the country has been pilled since the last twenty years, that the volors are not under the locks and the taxes and the age of the department to the retraite increased.
I had no ambition to become political.
But when I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to bring a solution to change it.
And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present me to the presidential or secretary elections.
You have entered the Senat but you are quickly traveled to the Chateau (N.d.T.: Presidency Site).
Didn't you turn your back to those who chose you?
I've always said I'll start in the battle for the Chateau's results of the senatory elections
Then I stated that if I had been a Senator, I would be presented to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, this is only a instrument that allows me to perform my vision.
That is why I need the greatest and largest influence of the mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation we're looking at the bar or before our television station, but we also pitch all those who try to make changes.
This is the pressure that causes the reputation of people and confunds freedom of words with freedom to lie.
For example, it was stated that I understood the journalists or that I was the adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Castle with a battle horse the themes of the maternal and penal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations above twenty million [of CZK].
You have to change the law to this end.
As the President, you do not have such power and only the Senate in its own may offer laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as citizens, I pressed that tourist guide activities constitute a liberal profession, I gained causes.
The problem is political: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, this is nicely delayed and it takes the citizens away.
As independent, Member of no part, I have much more opportunities to support all Parliamentary parties.
I have the benefit of power, without category and partial dogma, to take from each party what is better for our country and implement it.
Instead, do you think you are a man of right or left?
From a Czech view, I have the impression that people put me on the left.
For me, if it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're going before.
What's account for me is not that people are left or right but to raise people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common well, even if it is proposed by the Partie of the Partie or the ODS, and I do also impartially against bad ideas.
Do you worry when someone says you are a popularist?
But doesn't it prove what you said?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and a view.
You're trying to get close to it.
Some can call this of popularism, but all the proposals I speak have been applied by the world and the renew experts have discussed it.
But without the support of the parliament, you remain only slogans.
You will not survive for a long time in politics with this.
Do you think if you're going to see people and talk to them, you'll, for example, succeed in imposing the maternal and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and opinions and try to raise them in my camp in order to impose it.
If I was elected by the President, it would not be a problem to directly translate my request to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to determine the maternal and penal responsibility of politicians, officers, judges and prosecutors.
They should then explain why they do not want it.
When there will be a strong personality to identify abuse, it will be possible to press on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the Chairman on the direct subsequence, was obtained by the pressure of the opinion.
I admit, without ambassadors, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find alias for my opinions and visions.
I have just started in politics and I'm trying to support the majority of my programme.
I'm trying to do things alone, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and return to the private sector.
It's a little like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a salvator.
I know that one person can't do the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves to the secretary elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he worked because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigation journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the frauds at the maoutout.
I'm present because people are really crazy but now I'm exciting.
Seventy percent of people have not voted and, mostly, they have given their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're only two independents.
People have chosen a Senate that could hardly make changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, the election of the direct suffrage of the lawyers and the prefects of the regions.
Are you thinking to fund your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is unfair and then I don't have the financial means.
I have no money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparency" account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I appreciate about 60 million the value of my personal goods.
I have an area of 25 million in Prague, a apartment of a 10 million value, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of art works of approximately 10 million, a Aston Martin, a value of 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb of a value of 1 million and some million on my account.
Or saying, I have a Aston Martin, because it was a dream of: I always loved James Bond, who was running in the car, was ugly with women and stood against evil and abuse.
You're running in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million inheritance and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but don't you want to invest your own money there?
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I hear me?
I've already invested 2 million and half in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsor shows that my program does not have a great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.
My campaign costs are globally covered by the reward I will receive as Senator.
But I couldn't live it, for example, pay the English oil of my son who costs 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to win money, I will not present any choice.
So you're going to continue your business activities to be able to live?
Didn't you say that you'd put your activities in surrine?
But this is not linked to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partly reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the leadership of the Travel Agency.
People want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I need something to live.
What was your normal monthly salary when you were undertaken?
I won and continued to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was the President, I would finish my business activities.
You will find this interview in the Saturday Edition of the Prava Journal.
The texts of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real aventures are not only imagination case. To convince it, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly editioned mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is marvelous, it makes it very futurely, finally something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a guardian at the bottom of the street.
Stefan Spermon, an informatic in a big neighborhood company, said to us, "Yes, he's actually very beautiful, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, a iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's going out of his full pleasure in one of these nice libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a village who doesn't have anything to get to Rotterdam's gates, has a very special record.
The Community of 80,000 shows the lowest education rates in the Netherlands.
In order to return some neurones to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fitting points on the euro billets in the form of small armed beton miniatures.
The success of the culture official has remained limited.
So the authorities of the city realized that there was only one way to repeat the hand on statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, of the Rotterdam MVRDV architects office, master of arrogant graphics and creator of full and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its habitual flegm and presented to the concours in 2003 with five books under the arm and a recycling on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at, discontinued and raising the emblems, Maas, the counterfeit, emphasised his choice books by order of size to make it a pyramide, and completed his exposed speech of the active arguments by one: "Common dear!"
This is my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as it is said, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has landed.
The building is included in a revitalisation project which also contains a subterrane parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few immobile houses and mitoyen houses for a total of 50 rooms.
In the beginning of November, the books mountain received the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Moreover, the project was selected for the National Wood Award 2012.
It is so that this small nearby bourgade, which had nothing to offer until now only a post-modern petroleum area and a mastery of a huge laid, whose white façades invited to think that they opened a lattery, was rich from a contemporary tecnological work.
The most important is that Spijkenisse has now the first public cultural building of his history.
The long path to reading
First Impression: Eldorado of the book under hole.
Of course, a assessor brings you into the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture is open to you when you blow the ground of the bathing to the covering of his topgraphy.
The whole inner is a glass and is low, the ground in Holandan breaches and the legitimate reverbs speak without equivalent to the language of municipal places.
The city atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public, dogs, and little boys and girls playing at the ball.
And everywhere of books, books and other books.
"Normally, library rayons are along the façade and in the middle of a large and shadow room, which is often inconscient and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We completely boiled the classic space configuration and opened the internal reading spaces to the outside.
The inside of the Mount of Books was directly adjusted: in the middle of the Offices, the Internet library, the crash club, the environmental centre and the technical centre of the building.
A special beauty lives in the black rayons of the library, which are soon the lambs, soon the balustrades, soon the scale ramps.
A new experience for seeing, touching it and hodorate.
Even the teachers and engineers of the endurance building do not want inconconact materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the Spijkenisse community, in a response to the Standard.
This is how we found one day in a fresh agricultural company a ad hoc decate from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane has been used for years from a millimeter of spacing as substrate in the swords and fields.
It's a good market, and we win time.
The membrane fin is used during one or two samples, then it can be removed.
For the library, the membrane was first compressed in such quantities in places of a four-meter spacing.
Under the effect of warmth and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and transforms into a shadow, homogene and resident material, with a new car and sport chaussures.
On the top of the 105 roads, the top of the mountain is located.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary coffee offers us an impressive view of the city, but also Hollandic croquets and powder figs.
These recently create an atmosphere, but especially contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new
"It's incredible, but despite all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in the field of Ethiopian," says Trouborst.
The building temperature is regulated by geothermia.
Although the mountain of books is located below a glass cloud, the sun is illure only a little time inside, even the beautiful days of time.
Powder wood-mounted woods in comparison to the glass fascination served as a solar, intercepting a large part of the rayons.
Environmental atmosphere is very pleasant.
The totally automated storages are loaded from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned sectical information, was already risked to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, traditional Chinese medical professor, describes even Boekenberg as "the finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to give a book issued from his personal library.
This measure allowed the empty library that was not yet completely garnie (for today, it accounts 70,000 books).
The concept is a successful.
Rayons are all over.
For the architect Winy Maas, "There is nothing worse than a half empty library."
"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the Master discipline that is called in the professional jargon "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new literary history page.
Even if she can look young and little educated.
Finally, it is a new department point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose the abstention when voted on the adoption of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the request of the Palestinians to observe the State status at the United Nations.
But she then chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not accept what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must prove to be decent because it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think she doesn't even support the American position.
Germany wanted to confirm its independence, however, without being too critical against Israel.
During the insurance in Libya of March 2011, Germany also chose the abstention in the vote on the establishment of a air exclusion area.
Finally, the NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany prove difficulties to adopt a strict position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to remove from a policy that is defined by the Americans and establishing a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of coherent and common policies within the Union complies with the situation.
The Germans therefore have a number of fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used there.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but they are on the way of a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Great Britain
What then specifically means the term of "normal" for the Germans?
It shows the will of adopting independent positions of the United States and European partners, including national cases.
I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, thus by exports and relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or Near East.
German economic interests are, in a certain way, different from those of the other major powers: therefore, Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position of Germany towards the conflict in the Near East and the abstention of the United Nations vote?
Germany has significant developments in the Near East, especially in the Golf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to consider the opinion, but also the elite of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt a determining element.
However, I would not give it too much importance, because it is not a unique relationship.
But this is, in any case, an element that determines the German strategic reflections.
Does Germany note its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestinian?
I think the Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That's why I think the fraction is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
In fact, Germany showed that it should be taken seriously as a international actor and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
However, the United States announced their veto of a vote.
Is the opinions different between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American internal policy scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly evident of a great understanding of the European position.
However, because of the political configuration of the country, the government cannot hear defense its position.
I think the real differences of opinions are not so big that they always look like it.
If you observe the relationships between Obama and the Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far off of enthusiasm in relation to the Netanyahou policy.
Does Germany experience difficulties to conciliate its close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the other hand, with the position of the large European partners, on the other hand?
I think this doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but this is not the case today.
They cannot therefore enter into a larger political line and have to confirm their single position.
This is what they do now in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will in the future be a lolomotive role and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicated.
But I am, the Germans are very conscious of the fact that they have to play a role that marks more their independence.
Is Germany seen to play a role of weight actors at the international scene, do Germany want only to play a key role?
Or does she always have difficulties to take priority roles?
Germany is not always used there, it is still inconscient to him and, for clear reasons, the country always experiences difficulties to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we note that every time Germany decides to make more, many anti-German feelings are hearing.
This doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be circumcised from enemy countries.
In this regard, Germany is more delicate than the United States.
It must compose with very different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European Policy only reduces, but at this moment, the EU does not combine this empty, then who remains?
The Germans will just have to play a more important role.
And even if it doesn't like them, even if it's unappreciable to them and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of Marks" in China: when Puma and Armani are soon become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known marks throughout the world.
Armani Polo... what's it really?
After that name, a officially placed mark is hidden in China, but it does not have anything to see with the original company.
The mark thus plays a protection such as the company that holds the name cannot be complained.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get guilty of cause.
"There is more difficult for foreigners to protect their marks in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the Taylor Wessing cabinet in violation of the right of property in Extreme-Orient.
Each week, a new dossier comes on my office.
The imitators only need some additional letters to be able to record their marks.
Thus, instead of Gua, we are recorded in Lu-Gu, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German enterprises are also copied in any way, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sport articles.
Pattloch opens a classifier in which the records made by the Pékin Marks office are found.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company repeated the mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by accepting a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the mode house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese became the champions of the world of the copy and violation of the intellectual property.
In the large towns, commercial centres are located at several stages that sold practically only contrasts.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his hands charged him to attack the fact that the Chinese mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name already protected in another country.
The Chinese talk about "Bang Mingpai", parent mark.
The term is from "Bang Dakuan".
This is what women are designed to marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say that they have nothing to do with themselves.
"It's bad for businesses, we need to fight this trend," requests Pattloch.
"The mark is edulcorated, the singularity disappears, the reputation losses are great."
Financial losses and strategy costs are determined in millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of cost-pair products.
According to the data of the CLSSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market of luxe products and the most rapidly developing.
However, it is not easy to radiate the doubtful records of the mark registration and these procedures cost closely.
The last can take up until nine years, and the output is never sure.
Pattloch has stated the proceedings in which the Court rejected the complaint, since after a long period, the criticized name became a "marketing reality".
Pattloch explains us that if the complaint doesn't have a chance, he may even be required to pay money to the plagier, because he would have been crazy to his mark in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Clean cases also relate to graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the Sany Chantier Machine Manufacturer, the same company who was just buying the Batton Putzmeister pump manufacturer.
That is why Chinese can use an emblem that doesn't belong to Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo acquisitor, used before a blue and white logo that reminded the BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely dut the.
The Lacoste mode house had lost against Hong Kong and Singapore plagiers who had reoriented the glorious crocodile view in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO Marks office in Pekin admits that there are some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of personal and space.
However, the office would have passed the last year of a "urgence situation in the deployment of work at a found normality".
Thus, the number of non-treated opposition procedures would have fallen by 22%.
Approximately 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the year.
However, 81.500 procedures remain in sufffrance at the office.
Repeat Cost
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1,4 million mark demands, almost one third of more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a record and that it means that China is for the tenth conseftively in the head of the classing for the number of new depths in the world.
This would also be worth the total number of brands, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration reported in average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, such as the illustration of the case of the German family company, joynberg.
Since more than seven years, the company struggled against a Chinese plagiar.
Certainly, Germans could have suspended the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the imitator could maintain its Chinese rights on the joynberg mark.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the Guide of Lucnberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Office of Marks had therefore rejected the objection of the Munichois.
Thanks to the following two instances, the side side continues to be done until today.
Watching is to be put
Today, the case is at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive issue of the process and benefits from the professionalism of the judges.
However, he says: "The procedure is long, testing and costs us much time and money."
It is also difficult to evaluate the internal costs. The archive service had even been revised in the past hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, gladnberg had even offered an "ground amount of EUR six digits" to regulate the litigation.
"This is what it represents for us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Extreme-East are even threatening to cross up to Europe.
That would be the case if the imitators of this region would ensure the exploitation of non-protested marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to put the name of gladnberg in Germany for a chaussure and milk production company.
The company has long abandoned this sector, but it has even been able to prevent the depth.
Wentzler 日e: "The supervisory is the place."
Pattloch and Pattloch advise the German companies to demonstrate a great density in their commercial relations with China.
It is not enough for them to trust in the international trade law, but foreigners should "record also in China all that is possible to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much more important than those of the registration.
In fact, if gladnberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the opposite party for the use of its own name, such as Wentzler explains.
Or then we would lose our place on the market segment.
World Day of War against AIDS: footstock, song, help
Imbongi's coral repeated in Heidelberg, and the Swaziland Sida Orphelins enjoy their arrival.
This is the story of a link that is far more than a distance of 8.733 km.
On the other hand, we're throwing the foot: the cowboy boats, the baskets, the scarpins for ladies and the mucassons for men looking for the rythme by shopping the ground of the foot. They're quickly, they're finding it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the songs are slow - high, lower, dark, and superno - they take up, send and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra leader, almost lost his toilet chaussures when he directs the orchestra with his gestes of a salvation supplies.
We're on Monday evening, the coral Imbongi repeat a new song in the Music Room of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute.
Fifty songs and songs from 23 to 69 years have come from genetic in hum medicals to humans at home.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple song, every chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the zolou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
You're helped to help
UNUSIDA, the United Nations Programme for AIDS, believes that 34 million people throughout the world are reached by disease.
23,5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland accounts of 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is serial.
180 orphelins from the Sida of the town of Esitdieni found parrying in Germany through the "Voices for Africa".
70 of them are often a secondary educational institution.
For at least 15 or 20 euros, we can become a park.
This sum guarantees the child's money for the oil, a school uniform and a warm hot food at the gogo centre.
Imbongi means "historic" or even "single of praise".
No one can hardly speak the bantuous language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
Since nearly 10 years, the coral repeated songs in this foreign language that she brought to Germany for now to bring it to her country: South Africa.
For 8.733 km from Heidelberg's oil flight in the Northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland is Esitanti, the village that depends on the voice of the German coral.
40% of people reached
The village has approximately 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modesty hairs or earthquake, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphelins, because HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitenti, we can observe the damage of Swaziland at a smaller scale: the highest HIV infection and the lowest life hope in the world.
The population has never accepted the masculine circonstance, a measure which, however, guarantees a reduction in the risk of half-infection.
More than 40% of the Swaziland population are used by immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to be in the middle of the 30th.
During a group traveling in Africa in the early 2005, the coral was able to discover the village. In particular, the Imbongis saw many children in the street to which he missed not only parental care, but also simply all: food, clothing, education.
In a poor, without school diploma, there is no good perspective.
At the beginning, it was only some persons who were personally committed to pay some euros each year so that they could send a child to the oil and offer him a warm food daily.
But almost a year later, the coral was based on "Voices for Africa", a career who has been busy from almost professionally from the Eisigenian Sida.
Sexually transmissible infections
What are the most coherent sexually transmissible diseases?
Among the ISTs, it is considered its ownlis, chlamidiates and white-orragia (or gonorrhee).
The core ISTs are the HIV, the human pailome virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis powder and gale belong to parasite ISTs.
What are the mainly concerned groups?
Syʹlis and blannorragi often appear in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Institute Robert-Koch believes that sex contacts between men are originated by at least four cases of syquelis on five statements in Germany.
In hetherosexual adults, infections related to chlamydiates, trichomonase, candidose (fongic), blennorragia and human pailome virus are core sexually transmissible diseases.
The rate of HIV propagation between hetherosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, about 20% of the new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In youths, a rate of infections related to chlamydiates is more sensitively higher than in other population groups.
According to European highlights, the three quarters of all infections relate to youths of 15 to 25 years old.
Moreover, in Germany, the human pavilome virus is covering among young people.
What is the development of the number of infections?
It is not obligatory to declare all sexually transmissible diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syquellis has been more than 10 years: the number has passed from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been reduced.
In 2011, about 2.700 cases were available.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the year.
What are the symptoms of sexual disease?
Infectional diseases may cause abcess to the level of genital organs, urinary pains, white losses, low-wind pains and the appearance of buttons and glasses.
However, they do not regularly treat any pain or other symptoms and thus remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect to 100%.
The reason is that patogenic agents of sexually transmissible diseases may also be transmitted by orphaning infection or by heavy body contacts.
Experts therefore recommend to every person who often changes sexual partners to regularly pass reviews.
Most of the rapidly depicted ISTs can be healthy and late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to the parkings, the gifts, but especially the funds collecting the chorists through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
"We have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitenti," explained Annette Lennartz, President of the Family.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman, who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphelins are well located with one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, so they are called old women in zollou, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them gather up to 14 orphelins, they offer them a toilet and ensure that they come each day at the oil in their uniforms.
The orphelin who has no more is accompanied in a secure place, with Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the rubber, as well as the two kitchens that prepare them for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" created a cooking school and allowed the building of two pools. With the concours of the American PSI Health Organization, the § organized a HIV depistage test for many people.
This doesn't happen to himself, for even if the disease is good in all the country, it remains a tabou subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"The AIDS is a real tabou," explains Annette Lennartz, "for it's a subject to sexuality."
It's pretty interesting, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his lifeless life.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These sanctions by the State, inter alia, are responsible for the rapid propagation of HIV in recent decades.
Migrating workers also displaced the virus throughout the country.
However, there are preservatives at each street corner, Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, Imbongi's chorists are traveling in each two or three years in South Africa, and they are playing songs used by nostalgia, courage, trust and identity that many inhabitants of the Black Continent are still familiar with the time of the apartment.
The bus filled with whites that sing in African language is a sign of deepness as it creates not only good humor and joy, but sometimes also draws a weapons to some remote-border guards.
The bus always brings them to Esitanti, where the chorists visit their daughters.
Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitenti is well known in the valley of E©veni.
"Go to Esitanti, you'll find light there," people say there.
And after a travel of 8.733 miles by flight, returning to Heidelberg, in front of those courists who put their feet in the Repetition Room of the Bergheimer Street, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA covers the ice presence on Mercure
The Sound Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the Mercure planet.
The ice lake could reach 20 meters of spaciousness.
The NASA Space Agency proved the existence of ice on the Mercure planet.
Although this planet is the nearest of the Soleil, it brings the yellow water, as it explains three studies this Thursday in the specialized "Science".
The Sound Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice covering in the region of the planet in the shadow.
This cover would have a depth of at least 30 metres that could go up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from cometes or maybe of asteroids who would have heated Mercure.
However, no one makes a connection between water covering and the hypothesis of a life present on the planet, explains the scientist leader of the Sond Messenger, Sean Solomon.
Mercure temperature can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The covering could help to understand how water and other essential elements have reached in other regions of the solar system.
Unexpectedly, the inhabitants of our planet, sonds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix explode the depths of the universe.
At the other time, they send pictures to the earth, such as small interstitions through which the infinity is observed.
The picture comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet of Cérès.
As Pluton, who orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered as a "planet", ­ the new definition of the term of the International Astronomy Union of 2006.
This details of an infrared photograph taken by the Telescope Spitzer shows a "Family portrait" of innumberable star generations: the oldest stars are blue and the more difficult rose points to identify are the "new-born" in the universe's accommodation room.
The Telescope Spitzer discovered the region where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6.500 years of light.
The NASA's telescope Spitzer photographed the flamboying flat of a star.
The circle in the form of bignet is consistent of elements that the star is designed when she dies.
In the Nebulous Trifide, at 5.400 Light Years of the Earth, gas and dust forms new stars.
Spitzer's telescope photographed this galactic accommodation room.
The Pleiades, stars loves, also called "the seven sisters", can be observed at the noon during the night.
However, the telescope makes the colors in value.
On this infrared photo, the helicopter's nebulous, like a red eye, looks directly at the spectator.
It is at 700 light years in the constellation of the Verse.
His similarities with a earthly continent have valued the title of North America.
Combination of normal photo and infraroad photos allows you to keep a spectacular tension.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope could capture a picture of the new star in all its beautifulness.
One of the biggest enigmes of the astronomy is on the creation of Saturne Anneals.
A theory is that the anneals are the rest of a month of Saturne that disappeared 4,5 billion years ago without left tracks.
One of the biggest and cleanest photos that the Hubble telescope has taken is the of the Tourbillon galaxie.
According to the tent, photographs of spirit galaxies can become real art works.
The photographed by the European Australian Observatory shows the Nebulous of the Trifid in the Sagitary constellation of several thousands of light years.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divised, divided in three), because three powder trees divide the heart from the place of birth of the stars.
The astronomes photographed the premies of a cosmic characteristic in the constellation of the Serpent: 400 million light years of the Earth, two fusion galaxies' novels are predicted one to another, and the inevitable is.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spirit galaxie.
If you don't love the technical abbreviations, you can use its "austral fire road".
The photo of the Spatial Telescope Hubble shows a detail of the Iris nebulous, in the Constellation of Cephea.
The nebulous is at 1.400 light years and is composed of powder grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the core domestic powder.
This photo was made from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
There you can see the surrounding circle of black trees that are at 430 million light years of the Earth.
The space telescope photographed the NASA group of baptized galaxies Arp 273.
Scientists called the largest spirit galaxie "GC 1810".
In this nebulous, the youngest star group of our milk road is located.
The heavenly beach always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are linked by the Nebulous of Roset, also create young stars at 5.000 light years of the Earth.
In this galaxie of rayons and black, there is no more powder, there is only gas.
Scientists think that he was born a little after bigbang, when the universe was composed in large part of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since the optical telescope mirrors have not stopped growing and through them, it was possible to see more far in the universe.
During 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Telescope Hale of the Watchtower of the Palomar Mountain near San Diego was the largest telescope of the world.
The look on this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Binocular Telescope is located in Arına in the United States.
It allows the universe to be observed through two mirrors with each a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The Grand Telescopio Canarias ventre in La Palma, Canaries, is large. The look at him only reaches a diameter of 10,4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to make economies.
The diameter reaches all the same about 11 meters.
The inconvenient economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle level.
His particularity involves its great ability to assemble light.
Despite a relatively small looking diameter, this ability approaches the largest telescopes at the sights of the world.
Scientists listen to the universe to search for extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Each owner of an employer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intellectuality") by contributing to the calculation power of its machine.
See the European Observatory of Australia (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a valid installation of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can light the average infrared spectrum.
The building of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also intended for the ESO site in Chile.
His main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of approximately 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés before 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Vulcan of Mauna Kea were considered as the biggest in the world.
They trepped two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the observatory of Mauna Kea watching the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IR.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to add it.
However, the most important images of the space are from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he delivered us from images from remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler looks for exoplanates, mainly those who are residents.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before launching the Space Telescope Kepler.
The spatial telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent to the space in 2018 at the border of Ariane 5.
The first looker of the infraroad spatial telescope has a diameter of 6,5 metres.
The telescope will, in particular, have a mission to find light designed by the first stars and galaxies after bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pool of Mercure also opens the ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, because the Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pool of Mercure.
Radar data have indicated the presence of ice on Mercure since decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger Sond in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercure, scientists now have the security.
Drink daily beer, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach the dignity of the Bible’s patriarchs.
There is even a museum of long-respect.
A question on a country, in which we are still relatively young to 97 years.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach the dignity of the Bible’s patriarchs.
There is even a museum of long-respect.
A question on a country, in which we are still relatively young to 97 years.
The travel in the Talysh mountains is of a disappeared romanticism.
About the many tourners of the road, the small bus cahots the long of drunk, torrental rivers and modesty closes.
Everything is green and vegetable, we would almost believe in the North Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles.
This is where the Kazakh ethnic group of the name of Talysh lives, about which we don't know greatly, if it's not that they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and they have a very large long-respect.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town of plastron with its too aggressive architecture in the Soviet times that does not agree with the pittoresc mountain landing.
European tourists are rare here, the travel from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too penalty.
There are eight hours to park the 323 miles, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the riches of the country to its oil reserves in the Caspienne Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist.
"Bakou became honest in May thanks to the Eurovision concours, and the next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
She's the leader of the long-respect museum, the only museum of this kind in the world.
There can be discovery of the life of about eight decades of Talysh in the region that has more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a photo of black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120.
Having another 136-year-old child
But the controversy star of the museum is Shirali Müslumov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth act.
And when we think the oldest person documented was 122 years old, the age of Müsluimov is more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have designed a girl.
Sherali Müslumov would have been missing for a few decades in calculating his age?
Âbrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, also heard of the man at the age of Central Asia.
"Everything old people live in some regions of China, Japan, or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "in Sardaigne also, there are men who live incredible."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence due to the existence of documents, unless there was no civil status register.
Each day, a dry drink drink
However, people in Lerik’s region often reach a valuable age of Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
What, then, is the reason for long-life in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
In contrast, Fatulayeva, the leader of the Museum, thinks that it is a question of food.
However, it is not pleasant, from a nutritional point, that the rich food in the calories of the Talysh, who loves meat, bread, and especially milk products, and whose many drink a dry drunk glass daily, are good for health.
Or is this the simple way of life that protects people’s youth? In Cengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, lives Ruba Mirzayeva.
In her 97 years, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest house of trees, as it is typical to see it throughout the Caucase region.
She's sitting on the ground at the side of a bart, whose content she's hit inlass.
Eight people live here under one shot, among them one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a girl, who have been adult for a long time.
Two small children are also in the house.
In the kitchen, the tee is prepared for invitations used in typical armed glass in the form of ventre.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under her foulard they hide long trees of a blond that his son shows us with anger.
I have always laid my hair with milk, and so I have never lost them and they have kept their color.
"I never used shampooing," Mirzayeva.
The monthly retraite is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own clothes: tomates, pomps of the earth and small fish.
From all my life, I never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she talks to us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of the propaganda is amazed in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the patriarch of the nation, a man who, however, directed his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaidian
He was at power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded afterward.
Anyway, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know distress.
Mirzayeva receives a monthly 230 hands (only the same amount as in euros) for its retraite, a sum which guarantees a good life train in the region.
And maybe the son of Mirzayeva's long-life has the right: "The elderly play a great respect in our culture."
They're the center of the large family, they're loved, healthy and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "man's rights" in the Constitution
The revolution is renewed to Cairo.
Rival manifestations show the deep fraction of the country.
The draft constitution based on the charia is violently controversed.
The Egyptian president is not aware of emotional words.
We must succeed in transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said to the State TV.
His speech was intended for the whole people, especially for the Christian Copters, Liberals, Muslims, Lights and Lakes.
Because all members of the confusion and disappointment of the opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocraty on the Nil in the hands of the mighty Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by excusing, to have temporarily restricted the competences of the Constitutional Court and extended its "to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what he wants to save this 61-year-old engineer, a doctorate of the American University of South California.
Will the Judicial power be reversed?
The 234 articles of the assembly, mostly islamic, constituting 100 people in a noctural force tour of 15 hours, are effectively concerned in a certain measure.
As in constitutions, the project provides that the jurisprudence is "the principles of the Islamic Right".
But what does the word "principes" really mean?
It was, and it was still a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal manages that are cool to apply a stricter interpretation of the charia.
In any case, it makes a newly introduced article stipulating that, as regards all the subjects affecting the charia, the university of Al-Azhar must be consulted. The institution is the most important islamic institution of the country and its eclate rayon over all the islamic world.
This may, but it does not necessarily mean that the church will monitor the islative apparatus, which would actually lead to the enforcement of the Judicial power.
Many points of the Constitution project are to be interpreted
Another issue is the maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the government of Moubarak, these courts were employed to repair the opposers.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11.000 civilians were arrested by military.
The State must also, in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its moral and values".
In a legal view, the formulation is so weak that States institutions could even control the contents of cinemagraphy art and literature.
Inside, he would just act in censure.
Furthermore, no article guarantees expressly the equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibited to open or spread the prophet Mahomet or his sent ones.
However, the article does not define what is an offence or how it should be punished.
It is even doubtful that the formulation allows to hear that it is prohibited to "open people".
Does it be enough for a carriage of the President or to tell a blague to the detriment of a lawman?
So many points are to be interpreted in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in its own words, will soon make the object of a reference to the Egyptians.
"The Renew Revolution"
The opposition has been moved for weeks against the digital surrounding of islamists.
Thursday evening, tens of thousands of manifestants gathered together in an agreement on the place of Tahrir in Caire, promised to fall in the charia before it entered into force.
"The revolution renews and we will win," lance Hamdin Sabbahi, reached the third of the presidential elections.
The Nobel price of the peace and ex-chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the Constitution project is "to throw into the pools of the history".
On Twitter, the instantaneous mailing service, he accused Morsi's parties to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we'll go to his palace and reverse it," Jasser Said, an opposite.
"We are not yet weak, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
Moreover, several judges announced that they would not want to watch the referencendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Coran is our Constitution"
On his side, the Muslim, well-organised conference, called to an anti-manifestation not on the Tahrir place by a measure of precaution, but on the other side of the Nil, where a great prayer was organized before the Caire University.
"The people call on the application of God's law."
"Clear our country!" they asked Morsi, saying "the Coran was their Constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty on the symbolic place of Tharir, where everything started, would soon have caused a situation similar to the civil war.
Of course, that's what Morsi's partners wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opposers to the Constitution project, as well as its parties, were expressed high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the urnes of the direction that the country must take.
The project of islamists will certainly have the majority.
"The human rights are not once mentioned"
Hafez Abu Saeda is in anger against this imposed constitutional process that should have been extended until February and integrate all social forces.
This 48-year human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts under Moubarak.
He did not because he shared their conception of the world, but because human rights are indigenous for him.
That's why he was shot, judged and prisoned.
"And now, the term is not even spoken once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his entertainment with the World am Sonntag.
The extent of the powers of Morsi to the three powers decorated the lawyer.
These measures are claiming to the democracy rules, and they will create a new dictature in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President rejects all its powers," Saeda said.
However, a democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels delayed, including the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideas on the border of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A manifestant on the location of Tharir observes: "You'll get a monster that it's not able to control you anymore."
Norway's rakfish: is it the most obscure fish in the world?
The five million people who people Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of locals for a extremely wounding fish?
Take advanced sands.
Place them in the middle of a pile of foot-foot-foot-foot-foot-shales.
Wait a week.
And you're getting the detrimental dust of the rakfish, one of the most pregnant places in Norway.
I'm in the small city of Fagernes, about 3 hours in Oslo.
He snows, the landing is spectacular - and this hot, all presently, imprisons the air.
The rakfish is consistent of salt-suped and fermented in the water for a long time - − the hair that you want to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness is installed and is cold, the Norwegians raise themselves in mass to attend a festival here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat faith, then you eat a aquavit glass," explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local pumpy that is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the administration of the festival.
Along with us, people wallow out of small fishing songs and get a great amount of drinks.
"Some people prefer the aquavit to rakfisk," Havard.
The drink kills the wool.
I'm trying some songs.
If you can avoid doing it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent a long hour in a bus.
The rakfish returns to a time when Norway was poor, before the infringement of the refrigeration, the fish was cut into air-water barries, and then salted in automne.
Then, during the winter, when well fermented, the fish went out and - without doubt with the senses of amoindris by the alcohol - eating.
In the gender, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work, mainly immigrating to the United States.
Now the population is quickly developed - more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high salaries and a full health system.
The Swedish, their old staff whose country was, there is no longer richer than Norway, crossing the border to come to work.
The rakfish is considered as something important, a vital element, even though obedient, of the past of Norway.
This is part of the lovers places.
But everything is dear - a little bird pint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often speak about her in the international events, which is not to deplete her.
Here, people are not ready to talk about Anders Breivik, the extreme right racist that has cut 77 people, among whom women and children.
When they call this murder, they speak of "the accident of 22 July".
The Norwegians have difficulty to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could do such a barbary act.
Since the beginning of the 70s, Norway has to have its riches to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important worldwide.
"But the oil is not the only reason to justify our success," explains our servant, to the blonde hair and to the eyes of a blue transparent, the image of the northern welfare, with a rakfish plate at hand.
We are - how you say - people who are able.
His own, as the one of most people who live here is perfect.
We're discrete, we don't like to notice.
Norway has managed its oil riches with many density - all, except a low percentage of money issued from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries cast money through the windows during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cordons of her very closed bowl.
"When we can shier in winter and make the randoned in the east, we are happy," says.
"Not forget the rakfish," she's in an insultant laugh.
I'm standing under snow and doing the kitchen to buy me something to eat - I got my cancer dose.
In the menu, a hamburger composed of elan, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the fish's hair is everywhere.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where we use the craft for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most loud of them.
There is a television emission where the presentator brings a node-papillon, surrounded by rakfisk asylums.
We would believe in Eurovision's concours.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"This is our points, Havard."
We hear ridicules and appreciations.
A man falls out of his chair, perhaps because of aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult department.
While the President entered Enrique Pena Nieto is prepared to take his functions in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, interested in the difficulties that expect him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Traveling to Mexico is particularly bad at the present time.
In a city where the embouteilages are normally, a security bargage has been placed since Monday, blocking several key routes in the capital and providing a real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from turning to their work, but to prevent demonstrants from reaching the Parliament.
The next Samedi, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential appeal to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A completed task of the at.
Mexico's economy is good, the results to the President of Felipe Calderon, but the country is promised to a war of drugs that has already costed life about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has taken the commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto said to the American President Barack Obama in the Ovale Bureau a little before this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this purpose.
Before covering the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the Mexico State.
A very popular and temptated state that includes the capital. On its prediling land, the opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
For example, in Valle del Bravo's bookical community, it is included in the memory of all.
Locals attribute to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To join the city, you can take one of the new authors of Mr. Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been brought to these roads, sometimes bosseled and full of creves.
Arboring boards of his name are crossed outside of a new sports complex and of an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to make sustainable changes," said his friend and political covenant Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In particular, in terms of security and economy, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without failure to power, the Price was developed by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many attendants within the Party on Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of the opposers who reject the new president to lack of charism.
He's a whole, very engaged man with a fine view of the country.
He's a great State man and, above all, he can listen.
However, this is not always the image that people of their former Governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the australies, it is, in many ways, a campaign of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and citizens.
More early in the year, military soldiers were called for the rescue to fight drug gangs in the quarters, and women's violence is particularly serious.
In a kicked area, tens of women in the past two years have been found in the decharge border.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was ruler, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a tristly glorious place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that he was in the best way not able to deal with the problem of perpetrated murders against women when he was in force.
In the worst, they accuse his administration to see the reality in the face.
In a beton house, typical of this deployed quarter, Irinea Buendia fights to keep her lamps when she shows me photos of her devastated daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version states a suicide made by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came to her, he seemed to me that her body had been weakened," said Mrs.a Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been embarrassed, and the heat of the body was already amorized.
While his mother rathers the story, a photo of Mariana embraces the wall, next to a cross where the word is: Justice.
However, that's exactly what the family saw.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old boyfriend, a fate of trouble, a pleasant.
They want us to accept what they say and get quick.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and offences," she said.
When President Pena Nieto will receive its shop, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Decades of thousands of families were affected by criminality in Mexico during the last six years, and the new president promised that he would make its priority during his mandate.
"I hope it will be as well as the President as when he was Governor," Olvera said in Valle del Bravo, member of the Congrès.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about bad treatments, the prosecutors say.
The prosecutors are trying to cope with the maltraining claims that Bradley Manning would have been victim during the detention.
The proceedings on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defense wants to classify the case with the reason that Manning's sequestration has been done in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having taken thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate, Friday, that the Bradley Manning soldier -- accused of being in the origin of the greatest confidential information refuge in the history of the American Army -- had missed many opportunities to plan evil treatments that he predicted during his military detention.
During an anti-interrogatory audience with Manning, during a preliminary audience in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor. Ashden Fein claimed that weekly visit records made to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, were not complained about its treatment.
The opposite -- during a audience, the defense requested that the Manning case be classified by the reason that the sequestration had been made in very difficult conditions and constituted a pretty severe penalty -- occurred one day after Manning witnessed his desire to suicide during his detention.
This military information analysis, arrested in June 2010, is accused of having drawn out thousands of confidential documents during its service in Iraq.
The documents were then held online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During the Friday audience, Fein with Manning examined the forms that the officers had filled after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning and replied his answers.
When Fein recalled the forms, Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment that he reserved for his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in the prison was globally "very professional".
The formulaes do not state any claim for bad treatment, although the officers directly asked him about his prison treatment, Fein stated.
Maning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visit officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would take care of it, but they did not refer to the issues of the issues.
"They wrote "no problem" (after being inquired), and this did not mean that I had no problem," said Manning.
The Military Court Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not claim his treatment during a meeting in January 2011 with the Special Committee, which had been gathered to address the selfish thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months ago.
Maning replied that his intention during the meeting was to make its restrictive status indicating a "rash risk".
The soldiers said that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level under self-sufficiency risk -- for the protection and security of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was good, and I wanted to take away this status... to benefit from a better quality of life from my view," said Manning.
Maning witnessed on Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Koweit, where he was arrested for nearly two months before he was transferred to the military prison from the Corps des Marines to Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had planned to suicide himself when he was in Koweit and had been disappeared once because of calamity.
He said that the fact that it hadn't been read at the core of what he was going to happen to him or what happened in the rest of the world was very anxious.
"My world was decreased in Camp Arafjon, at this bed," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I'd be able to keep in that box.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had passed the most time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Maning also said that the only objects he had was a mathematical, covering, tongs, clothes, and his cups.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or staying longer during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Maning also explained that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, allocated outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he returned the night, they would wake him up to see his face.
The lawyer of Manning has made a formal complaint for the treatment of Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leaven日th, Kansas, April 2011.
Thursday also, the judge asked Manning about an attachment reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after he had been forced to sleep a whole night in Quantico cell, he was forced to keep noise before the guards and other prisoners on the morning during the call.
Maning proved that at any time, he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
The questions of the judge, Friday, Manning said that he had deceived the order of his guard that he had to leave his cover that could hide his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to leave it.
Manning witnessed Thursday that he had been forced to sleep no night, because he would have tried to prove to a officer that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning would have told him that he could have used the elastic of his slip or tongs to hurt, but he hadn't done it.
That night, Manning proved that his sub-cloths, his tongs, and his lamps were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiences he has made during his detention and that he will decrease his judgment if he should be recognised in the presence of a court of the court, which should be held in the beginning of the next year.
The defense stated that Manning intends to commit the less serious crimes and to deal with other too extreme charges.
The audience should repeat this weekend, with prosecutors who should claim that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagone confirmed that Manning was incarcered in the regulation which regulates the conditions of detention of all prisoners in Quantico.
Chiefs of accusation against Manning include the flight of goods or public documents, the enemy's enemy, which provides illegal information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all accusations leaders are maintained, he will be able to conclude forever.
My Mexico-American identity crisis
He said that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexican people have tend to blame those who have gone; they remind Mexican the difficult periods, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexico-Americans are taken between two worlds.
In a recent journey to Mexico, when I arrived in the hall, before customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
The panels indicate two ways: one for the "Mexico" ("Mexico"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Extrangers").
I stayed inmobile for several seconds, not knowing what file to lead me.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the "Mexico" all my life.
It's a ethnic qualities, in the same title as the one that my friends of Boston use when they say "Ireland", or my friends in New York when they say "Italians".
Then I became the "Mexico-American".
But here, it was Mexico.
And on the earth that has seen my grandfather's birth, there is no need for special quality or union treatment.
I was just a American.
I speak Spanish, adequately well to manage an entrepreneur in one or other language.
But I don't have the dictionary of an orbital, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passenger and led me to the "Extrangers" row.
I thought at this week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, the Maison-Blanche.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their pre-division themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexico economy, which is one of the reasons for mexican people to stay in Mexico instead of risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to go to the United States and Canada and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto commits to continue war against drug cards in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with amertum.
Most Americans have probably never considered that in 1848, the United States invade Mexico and forced its leaders to cease by writing half of their territory at the point of the street.
But for the Mexico, who think for centuries, and not for minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, since a U.S. officer forms the least critical about Mexico, you start to hear -- in the Mexico press and among the elite -- complaints on how the Americans are attained to the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the bathroom.
Yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country treats with more than 35 million of Mexico and Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to handle the subject of amertum?
There's a lot.
The Mexico has its winners and perpetuals, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer it.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexico ancients in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a time, in our genealogic tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, had no opportunity to go to Mexico and had to go to North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type of profile -- a foolish, little educated, out of a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not the Mexico.
And even if we live now the American dream that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose the view that it is the American dream we live, not the Mexico.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is evident.
We agree with the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexico elite among the leader class does not love us.
The feeling is recycling.
We remind them of a humiliating defect and they hurt us as if we were individuals of lower souch and not enough Mexico.
Our Spanish will never be enough good, our connections with Mexico will never be enough strong.
For them, our existence is a failure.
If our family failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never go.
And we will not find us coincidence from the good side of the barrier, living comfortable in the United States, but as lost.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who was emmigrated in the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are fractions between the Mexico and the Mexico and the Americans, because Mexico are more closely returning their identity and the Mexico-Americans are contrary.
Although it is a American citizen, she feels to be part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexico-American who I know have no impression to be part of a country or other.
We love the music of the Mexico group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of the two worlds, but we are not inracinated in any of the two.
In Mexico, we are viewed as Americans.
And in the United States, we are mexican.
And now, to comply a little more about the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexico leaders and a part of the intellectuality want to draw close to Diaspora.
They want Mexico and America to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should explain to our American partners that Mexico is a great country that is absolutely needed to visit and press political leaders to strengthen connections with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
That wouldn't happen.
There's too much fear.
And if we consider the inequalities of salaries, corruption and violence related to drugs that are almost present, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to break yourself alone, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexico people are not still ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico age and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-American have always seen them in the way their family members have been treated there is not so long.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexico" than I thought.
Old lovers, new Middle-Orient
The fire stops between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there never be a sustainable peace between the Arabs and the Mediterranean?
Another blood efusion indicates that such a hope is false.
As they persist in the same futil arguments to know who started, tens of battles were reduced in powder; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were citizens, and six Israelites were killed; and for the first time, Gaza's rockets came near Tel-A', Israel's Mexico, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelites and the Palestinians are locked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full mutation.
The Arab Premium has always stealed in scrabs, and the Palestinians and the Israelites are disrupted by this regional disturbance.
Maybe their fight will be more intensified.
However, there are all reasons to think that this could help them out of this mortal impasse.
A war that doesn't make any per - or winner
Firstly, it is difficult to demonstrate optimism.
Even if the fire was granted on 21 November, the fights of this week strengthened the force partys on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the islamist movement that leads Gaza since 2007, will have forced the Israelites to leave, even if Gaza has tried a race.
Having killed some of his leaders and revolted the 1,7 million Gaza's residents in one of the most mischief and superpopulated corners of the planet, Israel did not succeed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins the land on the West Daily, the other part of the Palestinian currently in their hands of Fatah's hands, the other more moderate Palestinian factor.
Moreover, Hamas leaders could say that time is their covenant.
The influence of the islamists in the Arab world is much stronger, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional powerful power, sometimes the nearest Muslim alliance of Israel, took and caused Hamas; as the Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic states of Golf.
The members of Hamas rejoice and say that the growing Islamist runs around Israel, from Lebanon, north, where the mile of Hezbollah exercises its domination, holding through the Âe, where the Islamist rebellion can reverse Bashar El Assad, and up to Jordan, where the Hamas covenants threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern flat of Israel, the mount of the Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, has changed the equality of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to dedicate to Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim brothers are Hamas' council, and their leaders easierly move them to the opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can be a major actor that will not be able to be excluded by Israel and America.
During that time, the parties of the hard line of Israel will take the inverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was made in box.
The Iron Dome intercept system of baptized missiles has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a certain time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renewed its indefective support, and many European countries claimed Hamas to be originating in the last wave of violence.
In particular, Israel promoted, in particular under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who totally ignored peace process.
Although Gaza's rockets have killed about 30 Israelites since 2004, Israel has been spared by selfish attitudes, especially by the separate barry on the West Division, the main song of what could be a Palestinian state, which protects the Jewish colonies who continue to spread up despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party was combined with a more belistic party, the leader of Avigdor Lieberman at the next time of the election of January 22, has the beautiful part.
Why do you dolote these Palestinian fishers by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Division, wouldn't they lay rockets, as their companions did to Gaza?
It is preferred to keep them behind this wall and hit them after they get out of the head.
Perhaps the hard line partys will carry it out; but it may be that the Arab pre-empty changes the donation.
Although the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsely appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to attack problems in their own countries.
The budget of Israel's defence is more important than the four of its four Arab neighbors gathered.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economy.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama for a fire stop what's good -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is dedicated to exploit a day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-A in this week.
The repression has already affected the democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exhausts this problem as the Arab population grows.
Blood missions against Gaza will have a diplomatic price for both two or three years to call Hamas.
The two sides need to be moved by those outside.
The answer remains the reasonable persons that are found on each side, and most of the outer world, and by this journal: two states, with a cease of territory by Israel in exchange of security.
A small and short-term hope is that the fire stops the opportunity for foreign people to defend this cause.
The Egyptian, who now has to have to finish the ability of weapons to Gaza, in the same title as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state at the borders of 1967 with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the foreign countries should also be pressured on Hamas and Fatah to join them.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than to the next proposal of a Pseudo state in the United Nations.
Mr Obama is also interested in what Israel accepts to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own peace plan.
From return to the Blue Maison, he still requires to establish one.
It's a very stressed vision.
The Middle East stability is a vital game for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packages are entered into force
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the shadow green packages that are all the same, whether the mark
This law entry into force is a first worldwide, the logos and colours have been replaced by a shadow and horrible photograph of sick bodies and representations of children and children whose diseases have been caused by their parents' tobacco.
Outside of the various health pictures and warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Sunday, is the name of the mark, printed in small characters on all packages.
It is the most strict system in the world in the area of tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government stated that the goal was to refuse young people to smoke by eliminating any representation of glamour.
Studies showed that if people haven't started smoking before 26 years of age, 99% of the chances they never start.
"But when they are very young, children understand the message that the tobacco manufacturers carry out through their brand," said the Federal Ministry of Health, Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that, for example, showed that the children associated with a logo to a princess."
Even if Australia records the lowest tobacco rates in the world and if these changes only have little impact on the benefits of the multinationals, other countries consider an analogue approach.
The tobacco industry pressed this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would repeat the trade in the black market, which will easierly give access to less dear cigarettes.
"The negative consequences of this legislation will be removed," said Scott McIntyre, from the British American Tobacco.
China and Indonesia's faussers will sell much more cigarettes in Australia's streets.
Others said that this law had dynamised their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, stated that the request for cigarettes, in particular in silicone to hide horrible packagings, has increased strongly two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have contested the law and lost before the high court of Australia.
He said Zico sold 6,000 to grossists and expected renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only eunuch, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the target of population.
According to a series of Australian laws prohibiting publicities on TV, sports sponsoring and the obligation for returners to dissimulate cigarettes, the marketing of the tobacco is now available online.
Australia prohibited the publicity on the Internet by companies and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites.
"If you work in the marketing of the tabac and you have only a small vitrine to promote your products, the Internet is the inconvertable place by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens in favour of the marks on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask if this is a simple citizen who worships the cigarettes of Marlboro and who has been able to make a video, or is it a marketing campaign orchest by an agency?
British American Tobacco appealed that the industry is on the new regulation in force instead of on the marketing.
The industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new justice decisions - these countries have said to the WHO that trade is unjustly dismissed, although no of these countries had significant trade trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the period of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had discussed with other countries on similar package laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More serious laws are currently in the study in the territory, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers remain insensitive to these photos.
Photos don't hurt me.
I ignore them.
"You're taking a cigarette and breaking the package," Victor El Hage said when you buy a package on which there is a picture of the tuberculosis of the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the Centre of Sydney, stated that the uniformity of the packages was difficult to arrange packages on the stage.
"Before, I needed a hour to download a cool, now I need four hours," said Yu.
"The Government had only a good time to prohibit them for everyone and we would have said OK, it's good, it's stopped and put the key under the door," he said, "was up arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to renew himself.
I spent five hours in a airport during the time of thanksgiving, because our airplane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another aircraft.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the subject of annuity.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
To pass a half day in a airport to wait for a flight, it is quite anxious, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones for you (without forgotten duty-free boots).
Moreover, some universities and experts specialised in the development of the child are aware of the concern.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to enjoy time in time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to eat creativity.
And as we are, for most, constantly before several types of irrans, we do not know the benefits of the neighborhood.
So, should we take the open arms care?
Yeah.
And not.
But I'll be back there.
On the other hand, in the way of many people, I thought it was a phenomenon too recently, especially since we had more time free.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, a Greek history professor at the University of Calgary, Canada, and the author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale日 Press, 2011).
"The neighbor comes very far," he said.
On Pompei's walls, there are latin graphfites that evoke the ship, they ascend in the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to this.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, a agreed psychology teacher in York in Ontario, Canada.
Following a number of publications and submitting the idea of a group of approximately 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his students defined the announcement as an experience that consists of "the desire to do something, but not to be able to start in a satisfactory activity."
What is different from the appetite, he says, is that no one is doing a job well she wants.
He said, there's no desire to do something.
What is in the heart of anxiety, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a mad humor and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
Injury can be strongly depressed.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both of them can be connected, people who refused to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes, we believe that we are disappointed when it is actually a problem of concentration.
In the context of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was included in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and its clusters made evidence of an ancient experience in which the participants listened on the cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups, from the neighborhood, heard the sound of a television emission that had no report, others just heard the TV emission, and the third group did not hear the sound band.
Those who heard the TV at a low sound level said that they were more disappointed than the other two groups - they had difficult to get out, but they didn't know why, and allocated this problem of concentration to the neighbourhood.
When you're trying to take you on a difficult or interesting task, an interruption of attention can lead to the wedding, Mark J. Fenske, a accepted neuroscience teacher in Ontario and one of the students of the study.
On the contrary, when you do a worrying job, "as looking at objects on a mount chain, music can help you not be disappointed."
In fact, he says, now, we know that when we are tortillad or hit, these gestes, often considered as signs of anxiety, are actually a good way to remain more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are authorised to gigoter learn more and have more information than those who are forced to stay without moving," Professor Fenska said.
We're all wearing on one day or the other -- the rest of my flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly anxious movie.
But some people are more likely to renew themselves than others.
In order to measure this, researchers developed a "pre-disposition scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "For the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interest centers that I don't have time to do everything."
By using such a scale, researchers discovered that boys have the trend to be more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology teacher at West Florida, and in particular need many and different stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blamed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a individual and Community development teacher at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a beeper.
He discovered that 32 percent of the teenagers claimed to be invoked in the oil and during their tasks at the house, while 23 per cent declared to be renewed when they were not at the oil.
On the contrary, 3 percent of parents said to renew themselves.
Professor Larson stated that he didn't know whether the percentage of today's concerns would be higher or lower than 21 years later.
But he said that he knew that "adultness is a period in which the prize reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control on what they want to do.
If I answer my question, is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd risks, to make up or to abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show it.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers have called a link between annuity and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for over two decades.
"The neighbor is the way the brain found to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology teacher at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you worry and use this energy to play guitar and kiss it will make you happy.
But if you look at the TV, it will make you happy at short time, but not long-term.
So if your child is concerned and you give him a iPad, he will no longer be denied, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or to do it, says Professor Fenske.
"This automatically passes from a situation to another," he says.
Your child does not only learn to divertise himself, but it gets more control from himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify it.
Just as I don't think we should criticize it.
It feels outside the constant boiling that generates activities and it is the goal to which we should have.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to wear us more often, but the neighbor wakes an agu and frantic desire to be connected to something that has sense," he said.
According to him, what people seek is a way to disconnect and appreciate the stop time.
"In a environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he said, "It's hard to find ways to start in something when the voice stops."
In Colorado, no new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, student at a university and foot player in Colorado, is invoked for something that will soon become in his state: the possession of marijuana bullets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends found themselves at the border of a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with the Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quotation to compare for drugs and maternal possessions that could serve for its consumption - small crimes, each accompanied by an estimate of $100 - and a comparison date.
"We're treated as õels," Mr. Orozco said.
But is that one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to analyze the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for its personal use, the response made to hundreds of business involved in low use of drugs depends more than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, who adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involved in the use of marijuana have been classified immediately.
Police services have stopped accusing adults of 21 years and more for minor marijuana possessions, since the law will enter into force in the next weeks.
But the prosecutors in Colorado's most conservative circonscriptions called to accelerate existing marijuana cases and continue to accommodate those who possess it.
Similarly, several cities of Denver's campaigns to the west mountains are voting to prevent the opening of marijuana sales markets approved by the State in their quarters.
"The things grow so quickly that I don't know what the future reserves us," said Daniel J. Oates, the head of the police of Aurora, on the east of Denver.
The regulatory agencies of the Washington State also do not have any questions.
They are searching for directives on how to install a licence system, allowing to produce, produce, distribute and sell - before the date of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, whether or not, is on the majority of the states of regulation on marijuana, in the context of the use for therapeutic purposes and now on personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E.
But no place or system, recognizing Mrs. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"There is no reality on which we could be based," he said.
The Law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a empty legal year, during which the licence system will not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be adequate.
During this time, practical issues remain in suspension: how to balance the status mandate that guarantees adequate access to the approved marijuana and prohibit the installation of cannabis sales in a 30 km range around a school, a park, a game area or a crochet.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas for a accepted sale of cannabis, including in the Metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a portfolio of the Cannabisalisation Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the police leader, Oates, to Aurora, sent a mail to his officers announceing that the "City atorney" (the representative of the Public Ministry) would no longer continue the 21-year-old people who had small quantities of marijuana and that the police had to stop accusing people for this type of crime "in immediate effect".
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new justice decisions that regulate the activities of those developing marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to continue drug traffickers and dealers.
At Weld County, north of Colorado, the "district attorney" (Republical Procuror), Ken Buck, is a more strict vision.
After voting, he stated that his office would continue to take care of marijuana possessions, mainly in order to press the users to desintoxic.
Currently, 119 people are invoked in possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, but many of them are subject to other inculpations.
"Our office has the obligation to enter into persecution against those who have committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognised crime," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were even complicated in rural places such as Mesa County, where the voters rejected the initiative for the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the comté, has no longer compared adults with restricted quantities.
The Representative of the Public Ministry of the Committee, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all cases of marijuana detention.
"I have no impression to lose my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters supported the measure, a legal and government framework for marijuana personal consumption is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions observed in various United States cities show the deep ambivalence among local officers in relation to marijuana's marijuanaalisation.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the Public Ministry, Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver, who represents the people accused of marijuana consumption and expresss it as a local portfolio of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Laws Law Reform Organization).
"They have passed a lot of their lives to continue in justice for people consuming marijuana, also have they difficult to accept that it is possible," he said.
As the first states to treat the restricted marijuana consumption at the same level as the alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are being a case of justice for drugalisation.
While defenses and representatives of the State provide a new border of ventures, they are concerned about the directives of the Federal Government, which always conceal the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defensors of Marijuana's allocation hope that the Ministry of Justice will cede.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marihuana and sellers, the Federal Government has especially allowed marijuana sales markets for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police will probably not bind the doors to take small drugs, it is hard to say that it is opposed to the authorised marijuana sales to personal use authorised by the new laws, Kevin A. Sabet, an ancient political adviser of Obama.
Many towns in Colorado have not expected the federal authorities to act.
Before voting, some local administrations have approved moratorys on the creation of new marijuana sales markets, even if it is only a year report.
Last week, the city of Montrose has received a 6-month moratory, and it should impose this prohibition in the next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find us confronted with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community instead of the state's vote.
Many questions are asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was malmened and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservatory).
These are not only students today who are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I always dreamed to enter the University of Oxford.
My father and my older brother studied in what was an eminent place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphithatheatra of modern times that stimulates the two piliers of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to study the story, I decided to do my values, providing my first scandale.
My father cried out and began to cry.
My friends were discouraged.
The Evening Standard journal suggested that I had left this university because I had objected that students in the first cycle had sexual relations in the room near my room.
The author A. N. Wilson told me that I was departed after I had been forced to drink in broken tasses.
The truth was less funny.
I'm running.
Yeah, I fled because I had been victim of intimidations and made the object of brimade constants.
Not because of my name, rather, is the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persuaded for one and only reason, and in this beach of myself-demanding, I was victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my deceased father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influent adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservative Party.
Why do you call this today, tell me.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-right students is the same type of perseverance.
The growing and institutionalised hatred of Tory students in Oxford is like last week, some of them have required protection of their rights, as well as gays, handicaped persons and ethnic minorities.
Conserving members of the Student Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christ College said that they were "isolated, personally attacked and felt innocent" because of their political opinions.
They want a representative in the University Committee for Equality of chances to be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary distributed on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of wonders: Young, Intelligents and Droite"), dedicated to the policy among students, which deployed the "Tories" as excentric and neonacists.
In particular, the student Joe Cooke, the former president of the "Oxford日 Conservative Family (OUCA)", who moves to Rolls-Royce, trees a completely silvered and moves with a chrome head-count.
In other universities, conserving students say that they are treated as emissionary boxes of the creation of school costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, president of the "Nottingham » Conservative holding," stated to a Sunday journal "you have a left part growing in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, studying in history in the Corpus Christ, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "inconscient", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, President of the OCA, said that there was a detection of the attitude of the JCR members in relation to people from the right centre.
"There is an entrance to the freedom of intellectual debates and to the welfare of members," she said.
I was the only one to think about this in my first weeks in Oxford.
I came in September 1986, then I was 18 years old and a paralyzing timidity.
The hatred of the conservator party was very virtual.
In the year, the university voted to grant Margaret Thatcher - an ancient student - a honourable title due to the reduction of the financing of higher studies.
The atmosphere was loaded by stalinary vibrations.
Since the first days of the week of receipt, when new students met others and teachers, I had a pre-go > what would happen afterward.
I discovered that the teachers did not only participate in sarcasms to Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was like that the political policy on miners, privatization and opposition of the Government to sanctions against apartment in South Africa was recorded in the wood of class rooms.
The first sarcasm I was victim was a translation to the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared there.
"Ms. Wyatt," Professor Harry Pitt said (continuing to be determined), "see translation of the first paragraph"
I lost my feet.
Pitt, a little guy at the poetry face, was easily getting up.
"Is that the Thatcherists learn the French or are they just stupid?" asked he.
The other students ried.
The lamps burned my eyes.
"I suggest you to take French courses during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy to make your friends," he started from your harassment.
I'm back to my room, inconscious.
At the dinner tonight, I seated alone, and I felt a fucking tape on my shoulder.
He was a student in second year of studies called James, who was present as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," he said, gentlely.
I'm so afraid he's like that.
Each person sosped of being a Tory (conserver) is taken for target.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be more hard for you.
Most of the youths of Tory appear to be Labors (worklists).
Later, at the local pub, I was quite trying to hide.
I insisted on the fact that I did not agree with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
This strategy failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironicly, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist sugar."
You're contaminated.
Other students have recovered the refrain.
I was perverted, sweetheart.
"How do the Tories love?" asked one of them.
They strike each other, isn't it?"
I felt like homosexuals before liberal legislation for seventy years.
Could I just have brought a normal life to Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same viewpoints only after the night's fall?
Should I be Labour and renew my opinions?
In the next three years, a cleaning of isolicism and isolation would be made.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, modern history teacher, who teached at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservator, but also because he was adviser in the foreign policy of Thatcher and one of his speakers.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its accession to the marxist-determinist view of the history.
In 1997, he accepted a teacher post at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started to make the ship between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends more openly.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was incredible.
In Oxford, all political points were accepted in Oxford in the 40s.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the town with dreams.
Even my friends had inappropriate ways.
He had the lamps in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tackle you.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
By my frequency traveling to London, my emotional resistance progressively deceived.
A friend, Tory, also, was pressured and rejected his convictions.
At the next week of a travel session, when another historian teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, which I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
Innerly sorrowing, I admitted to be a victim of my parents' brain lavage and the treating of "good fools".
The repeat was short-term.
That's my father who hit the last cloud of my oxford circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my followers left.
When they left, I made my wallet and I took the first train for London.
I never came back there.
You can treat me with a milk of pleurnicharde.
But no 18-year-old children should be victim of such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which did not only produce 14 Prime Ministers Tory but also benefits from an inevitable reputation of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers the delegation to notority "
In the context of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of la Couture", which was invoked this week in London, the ABC asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian couturer clients.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place of the British capital worth receiving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognised it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of la Couture", a prestigious retrospective that gathers more than 130 high couture models created for his couture house during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his enemiesable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the horrible point of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but who could not be written without his own customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and other than the nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, open to the next 3 March, there is a impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocratic creme, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, holding by princess Marie-Chantal de Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino expresses his personal memories such as the trophes of its social ascension: the modesty couturier of Voghera, north of Italy, at the idol of the international jet-seven.
There's nothing wrong to love the kingdom.
"But, they don't screw their cigarette megots on your wonderful butt like some stars of the pop music," says the Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza barone.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alpes and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives generosity and legacy.
"We all love to be invited in Gstaad's chalet," explains the former woman of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of beauty of the past time like Marella Ag日i or Eugeni Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the delegation to notority.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza with a Valentino model
The argentin mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not yet forgotten the charism of the couturier.
A few years ago, after a shot on the Spanish Place, in Rome, we went to his apartment.
We were a twenty-third of people, among whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"Along with him, each invitation felt important and appreciated," reminds the "all model", which began working with him during the week of the High Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass by mode, because his creation is art works," she ends.
Nobless Line Scrolled
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves well-heighted people and with the largest titles and loves them too.
One of the Gallerys of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium of seventy meters wide which proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and needs to add a "public " of dream with Valentino's main creatures, such as the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristote Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti was brought in "La Notte", or a lake and hot mantel that belonged to the Farah Diba emperor.
Within this public of mannequins, names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or So日 de Habsbourg are found.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first garments of Valentino are like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a butter, a chemistry, a gileth of "gillet" and a clothing of the winter collection 1971-1972.
"This is a gift he had done to me," said Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the couturier.
"I prefer to all others for his femaleness, his great love for women, and because he highlights our beauty," the former Fear's leadership.
I love the colors he uses, they're fair and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and modesty Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can also forget the first time she brought a Valentino model.
When she was teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed that she had age and the opportunity to take one of her dreams of night...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a festival in my cousin's castle, prince Edouard de Line.
It was a red night clothes, with a fucking jupe, a shocked shot and a cocktail to fall.
"It was a dream of reality," said the widow of Rodrigue of Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to the mode, is obsessed by the intellectual," explains the Italian aristocratic who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Arenberg's princess keeps the couturier's clothes with "the biggest care, because a clothes of night is not just a robe, it is also the memory of her vehicle".
Mode Kings
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller married in 1995 with Paul de Greece.
It was needed four months of work and 25 "raga" (the couturier calls his couturs) to perform this ivoire stole with perles incrossings, twelve different teeth and a tragedy of four meters and half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the Supreme Authority of the Specialized Press, this robe represents a historical fact of the high couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of the High Society".
For years, obnubilated by the "save-being" of the nobless, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of l'Ordre des Arts and des Letters, discovered from the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani comes too much honor than any of his customers.
"It's raffination, his calm, his healthy and perfect aspects have always shot me in the eyes," Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago a gala dinner at Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of the Jacqueline committee of Ribes, one of my big friends.
"He was impecable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The worst center of the world: the mules hum’s of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcan ports risk their lives and health through 70 kg of suffrage through the streets of stones.
There are people for whom work is a fire and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who win their lives by taking the softer of the Kawah Ijen Volcan, on the East of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas flowing from the ground is solidized in air contact.
After collecting big softer rocks, which have a total of about 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo pairs that he carries on his beaches through the shooted roads.
There are only 250 metres up to the volcan circle that covers 2,386 meters of height, but the evaporated porters put more than 40 minutes to burn this distance, at a torture time, keeping the balance and measureing their steps to not buy and fall in the precipient.
They know that a false step could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a dead fall in the Kawah Ijen Volcan several years ago.
Kawah Ijen minors win 5 centimeters of EUR for each kilo of extrated softer.
Once on top, it scares a road between the tourists who photographed them as if they were circle beasts, and with penitently the worst pairs, they walk 3 km up to the balance that a miner company has installed a little contrast to 1,850 meters of height.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbia, a company operating volcan since 1960, and it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupies (5 centimeters) per kilogram of suffrage.
It then sells it to 10,000 robps (83 centimetres of euro) to petrochemical industry because this mineral is very present in the daily life and is used to manufacture bugs, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamites and even white sugar.
"So as we transport about 70 kg, we win about 46,000 ropes (3,8 euros) at each travel," Anto explains, which generally performs three journeys per day.
Everyone takes 3 hours and finishes off, but it allows him to win 138,000 robps (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misfortune for such a sure human effort, it is the triple of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid 15,000 rupies per day and where the average monthly salary is of two million rupies (167 euros)," says the portor who worked at the Bali tourist island.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupies (6,20 euros) per day, and the job was not so difficult, but Anto returned near his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village of the volcan, for a reason that, in Indonesia, it is also indiscutable as he suspects: "I married a young girl of Bali, where they are hindouests, and I brought her back to Java to convert it to Islam."
Anto suffering of astm, breathing with difficulty, all constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
At 27 years, he spent three of his life to defeat the danger of Kawah ljen, but the pain already began to pay the fact that he covered his face with a mask and carrying special pans.
Anto suffering of astm, breathing with difficulty, everything and his eyes are constantly irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the vulcan.
It's the price he must pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work for two years, because I want to open a buck or study the Spanish or French," he promises in a more acceptable than acceptable.
Malmened by life, this sympathic and smart young man could be tourist, server or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
He divides a mass of insaulable trees with other porters, rises every day at two hours of the morning, because the suffure doesn't stop jailing the night, when its yellow color becomes blue and slow in the middle of darkness.
By defeating the darkness, Anto descends into the cratery with a small lamp fixed at his cask, which he bought himself with his own money.
Approximately 400 porters carry the paintings of suffrage on their shoes from the bottom of the cratter.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extract of the pain to economise costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work at their account and are paid to weight.
Moreover, they do not touch one of the 30,000 rupses (2,50 euros) of a photo-making device, in addition to the income of 15,000 rupies (1,20 euros), which the guards of this natural park make to tourists coming to photograph the volcan and its humous mules.
"This work has been made for animals, not for humans," protests Madrisin, a 42-year-old portor who works in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he has left the garden.
He is able to carry up up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "when he can" because he needs money to lift up his 3 sons, between 10 and 18 years old.
I'm not going to take my backtrace, I'll die here because the volcan is my whole life.
Though the pain hurts the grass and hurts the eyes when the wind turns and puts the minors in the smoke columns that come out of the volcan, they are so endured that no one claims to suffer serious diseases... which evidently have their habitual respiratory, arthrosy problems, pain in the genes and wheels, deformed by the weight of the pains.
By equilibring the bottle on his back, Uninik, age of 53, can only load 50 kg.
Each day, his companions and his 15 tonnes of vulcan suffrage, which three trucks transport to Tamansari's hall, 18 km from there by a road of bowls invasive by the bad herbs.
"I'm not going to take my turn, I'll die here because the volcan is my whole life," said Uninik, opening the mouth well, devoting several missing teeth.
The age of his five children, age of 30, works also as a suffrage portor.
The time passes, but the perpetuous mistake of generation in generation is one of the most difficult meters in the world: the one who makes the hum mules of the Vulcan Kawah len.
Singapore search for children to save the economy
The Singapore are responsible for this absent of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriote, you are my wife and a patriote, let's fill our civil duty and give life!
It may appear to be incredible that these words come from a publicity for mysteries, but despite that, or maybe by this, the video was spread as a powder train on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polykine in the shooting" to moving from Singapore's birthday rate.
BBH, the publicity agency originating in the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a wonderful way through this publicity.
His Creative Director, Douglas Hamilton, stated that he wanted to use music power to fill people "their national debt".
It is only intended for the Internet, so we could make it funny and funny.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we had to overcome.
We knew that the Government had tried several things such as launching parfs to the pheromones or organizing speed-dating nights.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we have said the following thing: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 Children
The Government of Singapore does not take it too much.
It costs $1,300 per year in policy to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of government for marriages and fathers grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends maternity conges and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effects.
Singapore is a rich and highest state of Southeast Asia, known as the conservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The rate of birth in Singapore, at its national distribution of population, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, it was considered as the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapore have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage policies and family of the National Division of the Population, states that it is due to a "better education" and "a larger choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a larger number of options in terms of life and priorities, beyond marriage and family constitution," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the employment of the number of wedding and loss of marriage and birth, which resulted in a decreasing rate of birth in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a immigration policy aimed at radically increased immigration to contrary the decrease of the population has developed a feeling within the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that acquire a geneophobie of penalty injured against new immigrants, especially for Chinese who are accused to take the salaries down and not to integrate themselves.
The immigration is also considered as one of the reasons for which the party in Singapore has known its worst electoral results since independence in the last year.
Since elections, they tried to correct the problem with the establishment of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the loss of birth rate has effect on the economic growth of a country, tax income, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The Government is trying to avoid building many small houses.
For example, this began to touch the immobile sector.
The urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, with the name of "caussus box", which could be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned about the fact that they can promote a wedding life and decure the promotors who want to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobiliary Society EL 日ers, states that his "cow boats" are selling much faster than larger apartments.
They are more popular, in the sense where these apartments are building much faster than those of greater size.
For this reason, it is much more rentable for our treasure.
However, he admits that the new standards give more guidelines to promotors, which were put before, if they wanted to offer too small apartments in a project.
Too Stress
Singapore is a state.
If these new regulations may be a step towards the national birth rate, discussing with the Singapore who work in the financial quarter of the center, it would be that they would not have much effect.
"The people are very stressed, the houses are dear, just as education, that is why people leave it later," says a young frame.
Others may have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time," says another young man of a twenty-year.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education, such as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the Government is trying to convince his citizens to have children, when it is to do children, they are the Singapore themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the dictionary of the Spanish Royale Academy, it is the quality of the private area or "the area of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the matter of the private area for less than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he expose by distributing on the Internet events that he would certainly not share offline?
The journal ElPeriodico asked five young boys, age between 10 and 15, often users from the toilet.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "what's very personal" on personal level and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not devote my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, 10 years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has a account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On the FB, I'm putting beautiful images or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I'm not going to share one of my photos or someone who would make the imbecil," he said.
The young boy recognized that it is bad to face obscenous photos, people denied, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on the FB and his nine subscribed to Twitter.
Most of them are family.
Her mother is part, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting Twitters.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just put them," he said.
"The social networks are funny, I can talk to remote parents or my friends quickly," he said.
He states that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He won't even trust someone who would recommend a foreigner.
Joseph's case, 14 years old, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, admits that he does not know 20 of the people recorded in his list of friends.
"I don't worry about it because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made her advances or asked her address or phone number.
"If they pressed me or requested it, I would just remove them from my account," he admits.
Joseph subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences today known under the name of cyberharcation are not strangers to the young boy.
One of my friends was packed on a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
"He never knew who he was," he assured him.
The victim, José, didn't close his account.
"He just passed it in private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
At the Difference of Jorge, this young man would put photos of knowledge in inconfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would do it if I was hurt or injured.
"Although I know that it's of cyberharcement," he said.
Keys
Marielos Porras, professor of education and license in Education and Learning, considers that, to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the objective of social networks is to inform.
"Internet has come as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed," she mentions.
Porras signals that the Academy Marc Prensky, who has a pedagogy master of Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomena.
Digital natives, these are they, children and youths who are born with the face.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
It recalls that the theme is complex, "for we ask them to have a criteria defined on what it is appropriate to be interpreted or not to say to an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do it."
"We also ask them to be selective, while the most important of them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences" she says.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"They say not to do it doesn't serve anything," she said.
Then, Porras tells some examples: There are things you wouldn't make to a foreigner, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would that like you to make a photo of you like the friend you've made?
Do you know what the others do about you?
When you identify the photos of the festival, do you ask others to identify them?
And also, do everyone need to know what you're doing at every instinct?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do it offline.
That's the same rules.
"When the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitor
Estuardo Guardia, university teacher, primary institution and educational adviser, says that it is essential that parents read consciously the conditions for the use of social networks.
Including each of the terms, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children about the implications of the opening of a account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or hold," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind the children that it is not necessary to speak to foreigners.
The sum of the Unasur has been completed without the declaration of Lima
The VIe Supreme President of the Union of the South Americas (Unasur) has been completed today in Peru without being rendered the Lima Declaration, although it has been announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 present mandaters.
Efe tried to accept the document signed at the VIe Orderary Meeting of the Government of the States and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported that it would be divulged after the closure of the Supreme, and then claimed that it would be held on the Internet of the Peruan Government.
When they were asked about the text, they reported that its content was exposed by the President of Peru, Olante Humala, during short statements at the press.
The access of journalists to summit information has been continuously limited.
Today, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio" was distributed in the press room.
The little information between journalists was given by the press attachments of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, except the Peruan portfolio.
The only document published during the day was the list of present presidents, which caused a certain disease in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media that claimed more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an electronic court to the media with the "final declaration" of the Supreme, but it was the talk of President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
In October last, Peru was the guest of the 3th Supreme America of South Africa (ASPA) and, at this occasion, although it was requested by the press, he did not even distribute the statement called Lima Declaration, as it had been announced.
On the official site of the ASPA, the document has been performed last March.
At the two international meetings, the Peruan authorities tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited at least information.
The summet also concluded with the Joint Agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a court of the Court of Haye which has a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala and Chili, Sebastián Piñera, gathered themselves at the regional meeting and said that they would respect the decision of the CIJ to hear the complaints of both parties in the proceeding that Lima tried against Santiago and who began Monday in La Haye.
"We will respect and exhaust the verdict that will resolve the differences we have today before this international court," said President Humala, on the side of its Chilean approval.
"Chili has always been, and will continue to be a respectful country of international law, peaceful resolution of conflicts, treaties and international courts," President Piñera gave a handful to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the CIJ has occurred after the Colombian stated that this week the Bogota's halt was accepted to submit to the decisions of this international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious error.
The summet was held without the presence of Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
The Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged to open the debates on the morning and clore the top shortly after midnight in Lima.
The mandatary read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 project action lines were fixed between South America countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the adopted agreements he mentioned that the Unasur countries would place "important approaches to achieve the purpose of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits".
He informed that action would be made to improve the "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and internationally organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, Internet access to low prices throughout South America, and to evaluate the risks of natural disasters together and effectively".
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triomphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to enhance a better future for our populations", concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 embryo projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said Peruviene President during a talk.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were involved in Peru and found it on the cross-border axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two viewed a more important connection with the Equator, although he did not give more details.
The final document also refers to the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration within the United Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need that Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors is another topic on the top.
In this regard, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, stated, before starting the regional meeting, that he would hope to meet his approval from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the next Sunday in Mexico, to discuss quietly the maritime difference through a judgement of the CIA requested by Bogota.
"It is possible tomorrow (sedi), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will revise all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua who will ask for a discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to say to President Ortega that we will regulate this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
The Presidents of Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to assist the enforcement of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the Defense Ministers of the Bloc will meet before-award to approve the Action Plan of 2013, which is trying to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Equator, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although this last country is suspended.
The Peru shall ensure the presidency for the period of the regional block.
"South America must have Europe's way to integrate a citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of the Equator, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, had to take examples on Europe".
The President Corree, who participated in the VIe Supreme of the United Nations of South America (Unasur) in Lima, stated to the State TV, Peru TV, that the Europeans were "treated in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they now were almost a country".
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the Member States of the Unasur.
"The freedom of citizens and workers in any South America country is to be reached, as it is already the case for the members of the Andine Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to do in the past," he warned.
Furthermore, the Equatorian President has demonstrated the reconstitution of the United States Organization (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatures of the San José Pacte on Human Rights.
Those who fight our ears never compromise anything, in contrast, we, the South Americas, have signed it all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, by allocating the political asylum granted by the Equator to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not deliver his principles, but he respected his "democracy deep values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, " there were fundamental suspicions which Assange would be brought to a third country and that its proceedings would not be respected."
Moreover, it criticizes the Swedish justice, which requested to submit on its territory a questionnaire about a sexual crime assumed, while "the Swedish law allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done since the Equator's ambassade in London".
Correa claimed that there was a risk that the mental and mental health of Assange detained.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our ambassade, but the ambassador told me that he had a little pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," said the Equatorian President.
Its health and mental health is possible to be deceived by being exercised in a small space without being able to exercise free air.
"This acts on the health of anybody," he concludes.
Correa notes that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since June in the Equatorial Ambassade of London, which would be the assignment of a non-conduct that would allow him to become Ecuador, is between the hands of the Great-Bretagne, Sweden and the European Judician authorities and highlights that he had discussed in London to find a solution to the closing of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European Judicial authorities because the Advocate of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures at various European institutions," he mentioned.
And he thinks that if the Great-Bretagne had granted the non-conduct tomorrow, it would be done.
And if Sweden, as it actually allows her legislation, and as it already did in other cases, would ask Mr Assange in the Equator Ambassade in London, or would ask it by Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa benefited to reaffirm as a defense of the freedom of press, and he indicated that what he would not tolerate was "the mediacrite, the bad faith and the lies that divorced the freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of press are not the wicked or perverse political men, but the bad journalists at the soldier of affection, singing and extortion," he said.
Under this angle, he welcomed that this is not the type of journalists "not the bans or the hegemonic and bourgian countries dominating in Ecuador" and, rather than put in front of his election, "the revolution would be extended to continue the way and track the right path."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the vito on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, argumenting that "the need was to be locked and not to be tolerated by the opportunism and tentatives of deguised State," because it actually destroyed the ability of Paraguay Democracy.
Moreover, the Equatorian President considers the desire of its Colombian approval, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Haye, which will strengthen the sovereign maritimeness of Nicaragua.
For this time, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South America and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be exceeded by the will of advancement.
We need to solve them in their ability to overcome them and go forward.
At the same time, he said trusting in the good resolution of the litigation on maritime borders that oppose Peru and Chile within the same court and said that it is "building that Latin America enters the international institutions if both countries agree to accept a so close judgement as it is."
With regard to the possibility of its presentation as candidate to the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to deal with a third consefficient mandate, he noted that he saw this option "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes too difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the primaries of February 2013, he would leave from life.
At personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations like those of Ecuador, this social and economic poverty can only be resolved by political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this eventual victory but we must accept that responsibility," he said.
If I wined, it would be my last presidential mandate, and then I will get away from the political life.
If we never lose us, I'll do it too.
"This is my decision," he said.
Correa also refered to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to Cuba.
I just discussed with the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that a routine treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This doesn't mean a recurrence of the health status of President Chavez," he commented.
The Equatorian State Chairman has now participated in Lima in the VIe, and the Government of the United Nations of South America (Unasur), which has ended with a call for a better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
The deaths related to AIDS are now due to a late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when it was confirmed the result of the test: serio.
"It's like the sky fell on my head," he said referring to it at the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "minus penalty", in vain.
The young man hid him to his family.
He decided to carry himself alone of his disease and began to inform about it and his appreciation was like he had just celebrated his 43th anniversary.
There is no doubt one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the civil hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio lived with the immunodeficiency virus hum (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choices of treatment and more stigmates.
So even the manager of an ISS Clinic prevented him from saying "for he was without voice."
At that time, the SIDA was sinonymous of death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "reduced" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the survival of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the leader of the HCG VIH unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he refers to the validation of this information in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infection and experts, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that the AIDS was no more mortal disease, but that the number of years of survival and life quality depended on the level of immune system affectation that patients had at the time of the bbc, with better prospects for those who do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
To simply speak, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV at 25 years, "when he remains under control, he can live without problems up to 75 years," explained the scientist.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that mexican life hope is today of 76 years in average.
If it is true that mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of persons died from the sequences of the AIDS has passed from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (unless UNUSIDA's annual report), but it is also true that 60% of the patients who are calculated on the national database are dead.
Nothing only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May this year; however, we are sure that access to antiretroviral medicines has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not from the access to the treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years, we have never missed medicines, the problem is that patients reach very advanced stages because they don't know that they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of disease.
It gives us an indispensable fact "new patients in ten come, while they already have an opportunist infection, what is needed to have greater impact on the global mortality, it is to perform more recently, and therefore, it is necessary to offer massive depisting tests to all who ask it."
The specialists and members of the State Council of Prevention of the AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who had to test his depistage in a private labor, just because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a portor of the AIDS and suffered from the Sarcome of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the coherent complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have the AIDS.
Some think they're going and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to do, it's better than I'm going three times a week," they say, "it's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I do the exercise, I take my medicines.
Today, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anybody else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have a active sexual life, but coherent, I take attention to me and to the other person," ra ́ Fabrizio, who accepted to share his intimity with MILENIO JALISCO to help those who are afraid today in the way of the World Day against the AIDS.
If they do the test, if they have taken risks, more they will know if they are serious and better, and if they already have it, they need to know that we can live like everyone, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Preservations on account
There are many footnotes between health programmes and civilians, supporting Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara, who took the cause of HIV.
And the biggest lives in prevention.
In all the places that are devoted to this, "We have actually increased the distribution of preservatives, before we were given one or two, now we are given a hundred packages, it is very well, but it results that some have no access to preservatives today," he says.
Among the most vulnerable new infections, teenagers are found.
The question, "What are you going to do?", put by social workers, guidelines, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, ensure the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that preservatives are not sold only to accounts, but that they are located in the distributors of the toilet and in the places that youths are frequently.
It is not to encourage promiscuity.
It is not even to pay them the girls and the motel, as the Governor Emilio González had answered when it was asked if there would be a preservative distribution within its administration.
"This is not the way sexuality works, but the best is to provide preservatives to people already actively," he stressed.
The numbers in Jalisco
13.435 compulsory cases are reviewed (12.158 of the AIDS and 1.317 of HIV).
The State is the fourth State of the country in number of new cases and cases of AIDS and 13e for the number of HIV diseases.
92% of the contamination are sexually, 6% by blood and 2% per perimeter.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each case recorded, there are 4 or 5 people who don't know it.
A judgement called by a court of the United States ignores the debt of the Vitro-Gruppe through a commercial failure in Mexico. The scenario causes a disaster for all national companies in the neighbouring countries and has problems with solvency.
It would therefore appear that the procedures for survival of companies authorised by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the stared bander, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the sentence to the judgment made on 15 June by judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Facilities for the North District of Texas leaves Mexico companies without defense against the possibility of embarging their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer of Mexico to take the Supreme Court of the United States based on three incoherences.
On the other hand, while the Court of Justice indicates that the creditors must register the United States failure law, the Fifth Call Court, sitting in New Orleans, states that the main procedure is the commercial failure formalized in Mexico.
The first point would involve denied international procedure cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Uniformity Model Law was made to this end by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrary.
Secondly, the judge states that without the interconnected vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial failure, the debts contracted by Vitro's branches to the mother society, the majority required for the approval of the replacement could not be obtained.
However, Mexico laws have this opportunity.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first thing to use this plan.
There is a half-two examples here, among which Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whom the Federal Institute of Commercial Failities had guaranteed debt.
Moreover, it is true that, since the votes of the branches remained in all ways, Vitro's creditors who faced it in the United States Courts, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have gained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes against 37.
A data missed by the Call Court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he faced since 2008 without stoping the serious economic crisis against the United States, reflecting the costs in the country.
Instead, the González Sada's family society will intercept the call before the same calling court so that the vote would take place in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, because only three had voted.
The insurance requiring will recall the non-processity and require the review of the procedure by a higher instance, in that case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the Court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the "amicus of the Court" in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the law on trade failures was detailed, indicating that it would be free of conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as the paragraph 15 of the United States Law on the failures.
Moreover, he notes that the country has agreed with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Commerce, such as the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolization of two parties: they deceive Vitro and disobey the country.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The globe-trotator of the "Hetin" Reyes' basketball has passed over 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, has traveled throughout the world.
A few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral hemorragies condemned him in 2008, Reyes was insulted in this sport for more than 60 years, that it was as a player of the national basket team, manager and manager of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamon, or as a president of the basket-ball Federation.
"I have brought several caskets in the basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was the president of the BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation for the 1990s," Reyes recalls at the visit of Primera Hora at Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn't exhaust when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all out of photos and memories that remind his travel without standards, testify them.
Bayamon in the heart
From all his memories, those he loves mostly are those who remind him of his passport as player in the Vaqueros team in the middle of the 50s to 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"This was my best years, those I had most benefited because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as manager, manager or manager.
This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships discussed from 1971 to 1975.
Then I went back at the campionship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a big administrator, took the team's head," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Albabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a busud player for you, he measures two meters.
You want it?"
It's just like this to start Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended me, Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best treasures.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to get a championnate, Gausse would help us to try to get another.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only a distance since 1988 he was already the large mantuo of the Federation.
At that time, he would prefer to benefit from his charges and Mincy's charges in the national team.
I remember when we first received it to the United States during the pre-olympical tour of Mexico in 1989.
Then, there was the World of 1990, where we arrived 4th and where we should have had to get the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us enjoy the last match, Reyes said.
Is the world team of 1990 the best national team you have seen?
It is part of the best, just as the Dream Team in the Olympics Games of 2004.
But my preferred is the of the Panama American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we took the gold and put a race in the United States team, which was quite similar to the one who had received the bronze during the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend the world of 90 because of a genocide problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individus, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy in the pre-olympic tournoi of Neuquen in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the imbroglio of the Panamerican Games of Mar del Plata, we have received the gold against all the pronostics.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
No doubt, it's Piculin Ortiz.
His statistics at the level of international tours are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different links for which he played.
Who was the best Portuguese leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team from Julio Toro, Flor Melléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armmandito Torres.
In young people, I love the job Leo Arrill.
For you, what is your biggest success in the Federation?
It was the most glorious part of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of 1990 BSN was up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you still do?
There are things I would like to put in place, such as regionalization of small categories.
For example, Ponce's boys are playing only in their area and only face the teams of the other corners of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people are traveling and playing too much while this is probably not necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of the obligation certification and courses for leaders, the staff of the field and the arbitries.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I hear of music, I look at clips of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my kids and, at times, I assist basketball matches.
And, of course, I benefit from the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been at my side.
Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became globally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known under the name of J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnated a man of business without scrupules, redoutable and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role of oilless oilless J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" has become a symbol of avaric in the 1980s, was dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who was returned this year in the role of J.R in a new "Dallas" session, was decided on Thursday night of a cancer complications, a family member sent to The associated Press for Warner Bros., "Dallas".
"Larry was returning to Dallas's loved city, playing again the ironic role he loved most," said the family.
Larry's family and her neighbors were with him in Dallas on that day of gratitude.
Linda Gray, who interfered with the role of his wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, declared his press attack, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, amazing, emotional and talentuous, and he's going to miss me very much.
"It was an exceptional person and he lived in the foundation," said Gray in a chairman.
The doctors had made a hepatic surgeon in Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had been a lot of years of drink.
In 1995, he had detected a bleeding tumor in the fire and he had a grave.
A few years before "Dallas", Hagman was informed on TV in the role of a type of dreams in the "Jinny of my dreams" series distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interviewed the role of Captain Tony Nelson, a astronaute whose life was transformed when he discovered a seduous gene, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought it back to him.
He also played in two committees that remained a little time at the antina, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in the cinema, the roles of the criticism are found in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his magistrate's interpretation of the delicately hatable J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The dramatic series of CBS chain on Ewing clan and their neighbors was distributed from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?" invented to maintain the suspension around a fully emotional episode in which Hagman's personality is almost appealed, generated speculations throughout the world and millions of dollars played in Paris.
Thanks to this, inter alia, the series has reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million television inspectors were in the middle of their Burnfran and made "Dallas" the second worldwideest divertising programme, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million televisors.
It was the beautiful sister of J.R., Christin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had made it disappointed and then threatened her to accusate her of prostitution if she didn't leave the city, but others had also reasons to aggress it.
Hagman played Ewing's role as a corrupt and insatisfactor but in charismatic smile: an ungodly undertaking and a faithful wife who tried to enter his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it should be as a epipaphus for J.R." Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "With the honest citoyen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman and a great man, both on the small and in life.
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans throughout the world, and in the heart of each of us, who had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new "Dallas" edition were distributed a few months ago with a great success on the TNT string.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, has informed the chain.
For the instant, the Warner or TNT chain did not have the way Hagman's death will be integrated in the series.
Fort Worth's original in Texas, he is the son of the actor and song Mary Martin, who knows the collectivity with classic works such as "Suthificatif" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 when she was married to a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenes of the New York theaters at the beginning of 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in the territory.
It's where he met the young Swedish internal discoratory, Axelsson, and he married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and had many years in the California city of Malibu, where there are many collections.
In 2001, he entitled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and absolutely true) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect it anyway," he said to the press at that moment.
According to his secret of the fee, he became an active military of the donation of organs and worked as voluntary in a hospital to assist inquired patients.
"I advise them, I trust them, I come with them when they come to operate and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a little comfort, as "Do not be afraid, it's not easy for a little while, but it's going to go."
He was also military against the tabac and participated in several campaigns.
A traitor course of the "The Fine of the World" has just started
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germes, and climate destruction.
This semester, when the Professor of Religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he launched there an irresistible hametion: the end of the "great decount" of the calendar of Maya on 21 December, which refers to many people as the evidence of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charme had no idea of what it was attracted during the following months: the Katastrophic Uragan Sandy, a tax goffre that some men called "The Armageddon of the Debt" and a growing conflict involved in Israel, the place where the Christian theories at the end of the time thought that the apocalypse would be declined.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I never knew," said Professor Charmé this week to his students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good period.
And we need to remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of the story.
In Temple, the assistant teacher Barry Vacker dismiss the course "Mediums, cultures and ends of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germes, and climate destruction.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate with time," he said, and how they offer hypothetic scenarios guide a certain hum's conduct.
If the nuclear armament falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could strike.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic theme and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
"I've tried to inform my students of what was possible, believed, and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, the professor of historic Latine Matthew Re日 and its Amara Solari, an adjoint professor of the History of the Art and Anthropology, made a team to give a course, just titled "The End of the World".
"We are "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world wouldn't disappear," said Professor Re®.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students have to study, create projects and pass their final examinations.
In the Pennsylvania State, the final exam will pass through the Guard of Apocalypse, which does not allow students to do other choices than to work "to the even night of the end of the present world," Re§ said.
The courses have been very popular.
"It was completely in two hours," Re > said about its course for high level students, composed of 35 students.
We received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the seventh, from people who asked if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"This makes me see what people can do to comfort," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and social student, originating in Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of Apocalypse, whether she is secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or no comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and infimery student, states that all apocalyptic films have been viewed.
"I never heard of a course that teached this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students asked, and at least one teacher said to believe at the end date of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project was about the Maya prophecy, and in a certain way we have discredited it," says Julie zegle, student of the last year in Temple, 21 years old and originating in West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Re日.
But I believe that there is anxiety related to the Apocalypse in Western culture, which has a number of centuries, which makes people respond to the changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a resort of these speculations.
"In other places of the world, people don't think about it," he assured.
It's most of the anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a teacher of the University of the University, who gives schools to the Philippines this year, answered quickly when we asked him if he knew that we were given courses on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines don't participate at the end of the world," he answered us, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace of Daddy.
Re > notes that in the past years, there were many dates supplied by the last judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will start to think on the next date" or to philosopher about the fact that on 21 December, the beginning of a 7-year period to the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date at the ère.
Many told us that they thought to go to "the end of the world" festivals.
"Parfous, I call friends, and we're regaining it," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student.
