Parliament does not support the amendment of the freedom of Timoschenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the attempt to reject the article sentenced by the opposition leader, Julia Timoschenko.
The amendment that would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister was rejected during the second reading of the legislative draft on the reduction of economic offences.
In October, Timochenko was sentenced to seven years for the signature of a gas transaction with Russia, which was recognized inappropriately.
The sentence is still unfair; the court will consider the appointment of Timoschenko in December.
Timoschenko states that the sentence is a political regime; the process was also undertaken in the west.
The proposal to reject Article 365 of the Code of the Code of Procedure, which was condemned by the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 members of the Parliament.
226 votes would be required for his war.
Libya's Victory
In the history of freedom, or resurrect, Libya is already lost.
Muammar Kaddafi was buried somewhere in the wilderness without him.
It was time to determine the winners.
Normally, the islamists win in the country; the question is, they are measured or radical.
The transitional Government announced himself as the follower of the ordinary Law of Shariat, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the punishment of the steel is the depth of hands.
Women may forget emmansion; the potential of religious rebels will be punished; etc.
Instead of the dictator society of co-ordinators, the Coran will be united.
Libya will have a order that we can't do, and we would like to want ourselves.
Anyway, our life is not the only one in his nature, nor the best, nor the most of us would, for example, reach the population of Libya.
In fact, surprisingly, the Islamic fighters have accepted assistance from them.
Their only decree is that the NATO was not the American General, but Allah, whom they glorified after every attack.
And if we are looking for winners in Libya, the West is not in their number.
We participated in shots, served Islam, and our policies were released from the dictator, their political union, without any guarantee of benefit.
In view of the recent common experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to refuse the military occupation of Libya.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the exemption of "christian".
Although without employment, do petroleum companys receive the black gold of Libya practically for unvaluation?
And then the West will be able to get out of the unusual protection of civil rights.
If only Sheriat's followers do not end this.
Starting a new wallet of Crisis
France and the rest of the situation are currently in the centre of the investors' attention.
The statistical storm went on on Thursday.
Where the country was found in the 3st quarter of the BDP.
In comparison with the previous quarter, the Czech Economy was in the state of stand, Germany and France demonstrated growth.
Yet, the long market is running records today.
Investors have not only looked at Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
Statistics of countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have found their preventions in the third quarter of economic development.
Germany has increased to 0.5% expected; France is 0.4%.
Both countries also corrected data on the second quarter, where cases were better than expected in Germany (increasing 0.3 per cent of 0.1 per cent). France reported a small reduction to 0.1 per cent (detailed information suggested a stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech Economy on preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, in comparison with the previous CVP quarter, it was in the state of stand, which, according to the Czech Statistics of the Office, confirmed the trend to graduate economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysis predict.
Key Events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech Economy on a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent, but it was in a position compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, German economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy and the areas and the Union's demonstrator has increased in comparison with the previous quarter to 0.2 per cent, which corresponds to the analysis forecasts.
Greece's economy is a preliminary decrease of 5.2 per cent.
Its 10-year obligations are 28.45 per cent.
The existence of both Italian and Spanish commitments is critical.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., begin to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is decreased, the income of the Czech 1-year commitments remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech Republic has passed the Euro team.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and celebrated an unexpected daily premium of 200 million.
The National Team has succeeded with the most complex task of the season!
Thanks to the beautiful Chech and the beautiful neck of Peter Iraq, they won with account 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech Team was pleased to maintain a significant benefit after the household responsible mate, and it will again participate in the campaign.
IHNED.cz observed the detailed report.
Nevertheless, there is nothing noticeable in the first time and great success in the second.
The Czech National Collection, partly because of the disorder of the team at the end; the Great Czech; and the Herotic Iraque; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the outcome of Championat.
The overwhelming defense of the Czech team has allowed the Team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovich and Schoolic became the most unfortunate couple of mads after two wonderful opportunities were lost.
The Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Collection will not pass the Championat in the year, and the Czech football is about 200 million Czech Crowns.
The game was very stressed since the first minute.
Both teams tried difficulties with combinations; most of the time played in the field center.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the host team in the first time, and further defence attacks were accurately overtaken by the Czech Protectors.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shot.
A few hundred university students have created a living shot around the atomic electricity in Iran.
Thus, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear programme before a possible attack from Israel.
On Thursday, the students had followed the request for loss and loss, as well as Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred universities students have created a living shot around the Isfahanian Uranian Richezza.
Thus, they demonstrated the preparation to protect their country's nuclear programme for their own lives.
In its last report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (MAGAT) showed that everything witnessed that Iran did not have the attempts to get nuclear weapons.
A powerful attack on nuclear objects in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Monday, the students before the entrance of the Isfahanian Uranian Employment District followed the Uranian demand for loss and loss as well as Israel.
In the case of an attack on a small paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press, the establishment of the isfahane and the Natanze, where the Uranian riches are.
Question of children suffering from breastfeeding: No morning and dinner colbs
More than 9 to 13 years of age, children have more standards; while 9 per cent of schoolers are weakened, 5 per cent suffer from heat.
According to the latest study, children who suffer from heat are usually experienced from families leading to an unhealthy life.
We see again the importance of the environment and the patterns of behaviour of a person, for him or her healthy development.
For example, the colobase appears at the tables of children suffering from breathing, nearly twice more than in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from breast-feeding, eating a cartoffle for a dinner of a question related to educational activities referred to in Azerbailand, it is not a accident.
Moreover, children who suffer from breathing are not employed, but most of the families of modern schools have only 15 per cent of children said that their parents have time for employment at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the past school year, and there were nearly 900 students of the beginning classes throughout the Bohemia.
Agriculture is not an accident in the second year of the field, with the support of the Insurance Company General Health Insurance and Unilever.
At present, more than 12 thousand students of 4 to 8 classes were attended to the project.
The proper food and the sufficient low load of me are the main factors that determine the number of children that suffer from exhaust weight or of fertility.
"For example, only half of the recruited said they eat five times a day, on the scheme of the morning-lamp-lanch-precus-sheet, and it is one of the unchanged feeds of the right food," states one of the results of the investigation.
None of the lanches and the cups in the evening
Experts warn that even such details are important for health development, such as permanent family morning.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school families are working together.
In most families, everyone is stumbled.
The worst opened was that in each tenth family people are not injured.
Yet, the morning is the basis of the right daily ration.
The study showed that fresh food is often used in families with children suffering from fertility.
Almost every day, independent of the wheat, drink sweet drinks every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly occupied, this number is decreased by more than two - to 15 per cent - when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In the other part of the investigation of the 13-school boys (204 boys and 172 girls) were proposed to compose their own menu, from the proposed products, and based on their cuss and preferenties.
"The preferences for food in the Czech Children at age 12 to 15 were far from the idea that there was a healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large number of painful, fleshly and sweet foods.
"Personal concern is a major population of sweet cold drinks," says the final part of the investigation.
As a primary patrol of the past, the bird has won a small wheat.
However, children have not shown interest in bovine, fishing and fruitful foods.
Encouragement to the healthy way of life
The study also showed that children are ready to change their habits in food when they will provide the relevant information.
"Most participants of the investigation group have demonstrated a significant reduction in preferences for health food when they have completed the check after the explanation of Agriration is not a accident," says the project.
This was especially noteworthy, for example, in the case of sweet cold drinks -- more children were to prefer only water.
The additive as a primary food of children have often observed birds and fish, with the number of sweet foods and profits.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, appealing professionals
In the first article of the training for stylists, I visited information on input businesses.
I didn't understand what was going on.
Lessons of three experts in this area; advice on the selection of clothing for non-standard figures; and the seminar on how all of this works in real life.
There's more.
As far as we are closer to the final examination, more information and practical tasks are expected.
Training passes every Sunday and Sunday, but he's really saturated by the inequation.
This time with Allenka, director, we discussed how to clothe a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One short hair, another little shape without appropriate forms, another weighs more standards.
The stylist needs to know how to decrease the width of the rows, cut off the hair or add the lack of volumes.
We have advised how to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, which is the equipment of a more intense grass and poverty and the weaker of the talents, and not to cloth them too excitingly.
For example, if the difference in the range of talents and beverages is so big that it should have at least one thing in order.
You don't seem to be deceived for the mediums, because the perfectly seated clothes are unvaluable.
In the yube you'll feel much better than in the one who keeps going, you'll be injured, and you'll get too much better.
The devices of small figures, on the other hand, may carry clothes with rubber, application, exhibition or stocks.
Taking into account the abundance of such information and types of figures, I'm glad that I have a whole week to understand all of this.
Yet, I'm afraid it's too much, taking into account the house we got.
Each party had to make two orders for any interest: daily and evening.
We must share their modern external aspects, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I'm supposed to dress Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secrets.
I'm glad for myself because it's much easier to clothe her than, as we say, Britney Spears, Christina Agiler, who has recently been corrected to a ton (see, please, I'm overwhelming) or a very young Selene Gomes.
We need to cut out of the magazines or find it on the Internet, print and process it with graphical programmes.
Mudboard is the result of work - then reflects our own style and respect for the image.
It is important to maintain a graphical composing style.
The stylist is not simply clothing real people, but creates product pages in the magazines (based on guidelines, such as modest boxes, pools, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Camenic told us.
But it was just on Sunday.
The stylist needs common knowledge
The Sabbath Lection on Figure Types has been raised by three specialists in this area.
Stilist, Hanza Pocorney; modern designer, Jacob Polanka; and modern graph Ben Rench.
Jacob told us that the mode is an illusion and a stylist must use this fact.
A good stylist knows one object of clothing and uses different.
In this case, the difference is the key to success.
For example, the pool-tranch can be weared usually, the surface of gens and footballs like a powder; but it can also be weakened on the hot body, without a steam like a flat.
Another possibility is to cut the hand or up the door, and all the pictures are completely changed.
"Play with him," he highlighted.
Anyway, I am most appreciated the advice, "For your work, you must know the rules."
Then you can start to hurt them," Jacob said to us.
Here I finally understood why we are to drop all definitions and rules, and why and why, while in modern magazines, we often see something fully different.
Don't talk about modes.
From Ben, the graph, I learned that the preparation stylist must have more options than the number of graphs he needs to do.
Yes, for a moderate review of ten pages (equivalent to ten sets) I should be ready to create at least fifty images.
Now I also know that the object of clothes often looks and works in comparison with others is not as real.
We need to mean that when we create an image.
Hunza Pocorney confirmed that the image and style often are half success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a vulnerable box, but her image and marketing have converted her into a world star.
The relation to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cold.
Even the people often think that it's unclean (and they believe that it's enough to be a specialist in something, and how they look, it's secondary).
And if somebody finally allows us to create their style, we should expect that they will call us another (small) size than that they are really wearing.
Then we turn to Google and see if the tabloids have not written anything about something that was somewhat famous of the poultry, etc.
On Sunday, Hungza and Mario were accused of the fact that the stylist was insufficient to be considered in the mode and to be able to take advantage.
Our work is mainly from communicating with people we are clothing; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To understand people, not to build them and to keep their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to watch her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw out all her guard, saying to her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can thank, and advise that you can bring together with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that it should be strictly placed in the robbery.
It's the cup you're connecting around the hall to wear all that is necessary.
Besides obvious things, such as knifes, nice rubbers or English clusters, there must be a neulone knife (stylists use it for the summary of some objects, such as cups or sticks), special clips for strengthening the weapons in case the clothes are too large (bottles and similar objects are prohibited, as they put their clothes) or a set of shirts.
To get some practical experience from lessons and get some practical experience, we learned to make the correct instructions on the underground tuff.
Even in the study, where half hungry, the wounds can get hurt - not talking about the gate.
And here we're taking a shot.
You don't have to cut a fuckin' knife so that you don't get them out.
This requires real mastership.
I was glad that Mary had praised.
I've not been able to do what I was doing.
It's just a part of what we heard during the second part of the course of the outcome day.
I'm starting to understand that being a professional stylist isn't so easy to say whatever they say.
V Need for Speed: Refuge occurs in America.
View
What must have been uninterrupted has been converted into a routine morning to a series of incompatible and irregular errors.
Ambitions were satisfied to a certain degree, but it is not important because no one was clearly wanted to do the last.
Before the new version with the "Flug" subtitle, there were great hopes.
It was expected that it would break the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions were witnessed that the game would take a valuable place in the genre of games.
We were interested in seeing parts of the game where the main hero gets out of the car and runs.
As it is often with NFS, then, many different from what we expected.
The game is a lot of bad arcade, but the general impression has caused some unnecessary errors that have been present in this series of games a few years.
And it's actually not a mistake, but a manifestation of an unexplainable line of times.
The accommodation starts very well.
You are a part of the story, the main held, Jack, decides to resolve some different problems with the participation in illegal trail through America.
You're a garden in a car on the western, in San Francisco, and your task is to come to New York first.
This is a number of interesting features.
The road consists of ten steps divided by more than fifty trailers.
This means that every trick is going on its road, where this is going in a different and interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no feeling that the same thing happens at the same time.
Although the graphics are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is pleased to look at some tracks.
Yet, the game doesn't cause strong emotions.
Although it is very pleasant to drive a car through the wilderness, it is in the low mountains.
Furthermore, the gain of time survives too common.
For example, in the wilderness you fall into a rain storm that is significantly decreasing.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful so that they do not fall under the lavine.
Where's the tracks quite well arranged.
There's just a few differences, but it's enough.
Sometimes you are trying to deal with a number of co-operators (even by ordinary trial); then you are trying to improve the time (default with a secondary) or you are with one opposer.
Despite all other things, you are currently attacking the field, which makes your task more difficult.
The components of the car's outside are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack is running from someone and you must help him by pressing the needed buttons at the time.
Nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be precise).
In fact, it is good for the game because it doesn't have the property; taking into account all the above, it's one of the things that make the game more busy.
Node model and tracks of previous models.
This means that it doesn't mean anything special anymore, but it is to be considered to be insufficient.
If you are looking for real life, you need to find another.
However, this model of management is very suitable for dynamic traces, although the market can be found better options.
Not until it's fine.
However, sometimes the problems begin.
In contrast with the driving model, the model of driving is not so good.
You don't expect complex conversions and conversions, but if you don't understand the object, how your car's going to be, something's wrong.
Usually, by shaking or walking out of the cars in the floor, you sometimes slightly cuts a different machine, and sometimes, in practically similar situation, your car begins to be disappointed.
Or the kids were disrupted.
This is not so important by the restarting system, but it's enough to enjoy pleasure.
Restarts are built so if you break or get away from the trace, the game returns you to the point where it has been interrupted.
Nevertheless, only five steps are available for each track.
If you're using them all, you'll have to start the fuck from the beginning.
It's if something doesn't get, but you can't completely trust it.
Sometimes it is not enough, and you have to learn about the naissance of the part of the track.
The important deficiency of the game is that the same things are often happening in the same places.
For example, some turns have to go through a certain way, Otherwise you will not just write.
In other cases, you meet civil machines in the same construction in one and the same configuration, whether you come first, five, for five seconds before or for a minute later.
This particularly disturbs situations when you see how your companion easily moves between the two cars that move in the opposite direction, while when you appear there, the cars are already placed in such a way that you need to move them or to quit the speed.
It is not important when you show them near; all are designed so that the situation always happens before your nose.
There are other advantages.
During the game, you find a few of them, where, independently from time, one of the same companioners is going to blame you on the same.
This is particularly evident at the end of the game, on the long pool, where you eat in the opposite direction.
Of course, your companion must stand before you despite anything.
The fact is that when he is before you, he disturbs you to consider that it leads to one or more events on this party.
You may understand the trial to make a game more interesting and filled with adrenali, but this is so clearly that it begins quickly to be distracted.
Sorry, despite a simple model of conduct, the game is busy and sometimes so saturated by events that you don't have time to take attention to what is happening around you.
It doesn't matter that you don't give up -- a concept of fifty unilateral traces, a follow-up of trace or something else.
The idea of the change of cars during the shopping is unusual.
You need to follow the changes on the road because your car can be changed in them, despite the most of the cases you have, it is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sporting cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for famous shoes; and exotic super-sporters for technical management, for example, on the outbreaked mountain traces.
The main story mode intensely with the challenge mode; it is a trace for individual parts you will learn about the game.
Here you enjoy your personal business, both medals and eyes, common for challenges and stories regimes.
Many opportunities are available to get a higher level of conduct: starting from machines and finishing the data profile.
Moreover, the profile with the Autolog online function, which, above all, compares you with the results of other players, and provides connections with the public.
There is another failure that is difficult to understand; it is an example of the last trial in the success.
You and your car fall into a metro tonne (we will think so), where you are mixed by the rels in the darkness (we will think so).
Your spodmeter shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (will be considered so), when the metro moves back on you, turning your car into the metal brush.
Over a few days, our editor discussed whether we really were not able to see any seconds in the creation of the game, or that its creators really viewed us as such a boldness.
The technical composer of games does not represent anything special; but the general impression of the video range is most often pleasant, sometimes even by it.
Despite some critical moments, the quality of the record is sometimes quickly decreased.
This is especially the case of events with a large number of participants where the good record would not help you too.
The sound is okay; the sundtree is on the lovers.
In order to please the larger youth auditorium, "incoming compositions from different styles" in soundtrec; but whether many people are buying a game because of it.
Common impression of Need for Speed: Got a lot of freedom.
If the game had disappeared clearly unnecessary errors, we could sincerely say that the Flight is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the rest of the game will feel incomplete.
Of course, this is a good time, but prepare for the failure of you as a airport projector.

Work in the EU Vicenova:
Czech reputation has no desirers and skeptics to.
"The Lisbon Treaty expressed the meaning of discrimination between the Lithuanians."
"I didn't expect to be such a violent war."
"Fem or six years ago, before the situation is stabilised, it will be quiet and all players will be used to their new roles," the EU Milena Vicenna has hardly started his lesson on the jury.
It is before it, as far as it holds its "Only and openly about" division in the first part of its lesson, where she described the EU institutions and between them so simple and understanding that many readers from the CU's jurisdiction would be given.
Moreover, Vicena thanked the new permanent Chairman of the Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"Sna," the critics said that he was a usual serial office mouse, which could not play any role; I should say, they were all hurt how well he did his role."
"The person who can listen to twenty-seven countries at the same time to communicate with them and has a clear presentation on which side the EU should develop."
She explained her new position to the representative of security and security issues as a response to the question, "Who is the Union, and what number should I call?", which is the important step in the direction of the Union and the more transparent policies in relation to countries such as China or India.
Nobody's going to prohibit our shirts
It continued to focus on the EU's key programme in the past, the present and closer future.
She called the successful Chairman of the Czech Republic in the last year.
The Czech had an issue of overall financial crisis; they overcome this crisis and the body of the East Partnership.
She said that the distortion of the Government at that time was a negative manifestation that caused a weak damage to the Czech Republic.
Today, the representatives of the Czech Republic are very busy in the EU.
As the employee said, and the presidentship, and the following financial crisis has caused the continuing breakdown.
Moreover, a new seven-year budget of the EU must be adopted, which is very difficult to take into account the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be strict and economical to which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and less; all these issues are in the future programme.
The work on the key lozings that she brought to Brussels: "O §, understanding language."
"I really don't like decreasing, foreign words, and gargons that no one understands.
As citizens, people can understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell → or round wheels, bananas of different sizes, or that someone will prohibit our sugar types."
It will also make use of the EU environment more effective and more cheques in Peace organizations.
Very valuable is our future
The staff claims that cheques are considered as skeptics, as well as people who notice the negative and not the sides of the matter.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be held in the Peace organizations.
It believes that there are several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their failure to write motivation writings; at the same time with a small support from the Czech Republic.
In addition to the successful Presidency of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Vice-Group.
"Create that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we have a word here, the French says, "Hey, what way of the congregation, the Vice-Group?" and he doesn't like it."
In the future, the Union of Vice-President is expected in the mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of States parties.
In comparison with the new Federation, it considers the idea of two potential, if not much more ability.
"We have both countries inside and outside the areas."
"We have Shanghagen's area, and we've already got a strong cooperation institution."
"For the first time, the countries who wanted should be united, while those who did not want can stay on the side."
"The number of such agencies will grow; it will actually be the two potential," expects Vicenava.
In this regard, it stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in the implementation of the rules, with which all issues that are addressed by the EU should be discussed by all parties countries, not only in the area.
Board history:
The IBM newspaper comes into its second century.
If someone wants to find a word that is best expressed by IMB, the most close, probably, will be "long."
For IBM's large public, it is a symbol of technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was more than hundred years ago.
The duration of the company was assigned to her first boss, Mr. Thomas J. Watson's older.
He believed in his neighborhood, in which many world problems could be easily resolved if people would think.
His "D'yes" launch is thus the stamp, around which the life of the future gigant was developed (as well as the name of its internal journal, which IMB began to be issued in 1935).
Moreover, this was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson had exhibited.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement to the future.
The IBM survived and flowed hundred years because she remained faithful to her unique values, even though she was not afraid to change everything around herself.
In our first hundred years, this allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to reach even greater," says the current companion's rubber of the Company, J. Palmizano, in Jubilee.
Complicated System
In the 1930 ’ s, Watson approached the concerns of employees as Batia in the Czech Republic - IMB was one of the first American servants with a payable department, a assurance from the robotic, an elegant uniform and a complex bonus system for the best exhibitors and undertakers.
The same is the long-term IBM with consumers.
Since the beginning, the company found a broader application of talenting people, which was one of the first world companys who had eliminated the whole discrimination, which was a great choice for her.
It is agreed with the anti-discrimination and the current plan, with which the woman, Virginia Rommetti, will change Palmisano in the year.
She worked in IBM for thirty years; now she is a sales, marketing and development director.
The last few years the IBM organized meetings, the online brain shoes, where many future innovations occur.
It's not surprised that a lot of ideas work about half million people in the company.
Organization with good reputation
The strong position of the company in business is provided by a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, the concept of IBM was an organization, not a technology company," said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the IBM Rosabeet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technological company, it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology," adds Jodge Coloni from the Forrester Research Consulting Company.
As they say in the company, there is a difference between the way to get out of the market and create it.
In hundred years of IBM, or "Golubai gigant", as it is called in the United States because of his logope, he became one of the major world companys.
It seems that this is the most universal technological company that develops equipment and software; infrastructure; hosting and consular services from servers to nanotechnology.
It possesses the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of them received the Nobel Premium.
Its exemptions include, for example, bankomate, bank card, financial supper, strike code and diskette.
With 220 billion dollars, according to the market capitalisation, IBM has been the second of the Technical Company (the first place of Apple) in 1996.
Look forward
Not all of her products came on the purchases and entered in the epoch. For example, IBM failed with its operating system OS/2; the Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by a movement forward, you can't be emotionally related to the past," says S.J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM is easily based on several -- if they do not work, it refuses.
This is different, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, which is based and concerned about the falling on Windows, its operating system.
Per-protection technology
IBM's basic income is received from services, which is about one five in each case from computer programmes and equipment.
While in 1990, with the two less capital, she was the best equipment manufacturer company.
Since 2000, the IBM sold a lower amount of $15 billion, which included $58 billion in the purchase of per-technology.
She continued investment even after 2008, when the current economic crisis was first affected by the world.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the year of great depression.
Goodbye, IBM hasn't caused the current crisis.
Since 2008, IBM's price has grown up to 120 per cent record; it is pure for the company to grow.
Corporative IBM girl is to change everything other than its own prices.
It is therefore expected that even if another crisis occurs, this swimming gigant will face the situation.
History of IBM: from the white knife to the space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was a hundred years ago in New York; its original name "Calculation, Tabulation, recording" was sufficiently complex.
It took the name of IBM in 1924, which was the name of the Brand, which was designed for the company in Canada and South America.
The funds of the future IBM were based on four companies beginning in 1880.
They possessed technologies such as the "days of hours" for you, i.e. hours that make time when they come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was businessman of Ranlet Flint, who also headed the company's winners before 1930.
Flint took a competitive company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The IBM founder then rejected in the darkness - Watson's ideas are based on the insufficient corporate culture and individuality.
Watson appointed a company until 1952.
IBM, as clear from the name, began from the production and sale of different business equipment - from grassed legs and meat to cash equipment.
In the first four years, Watson's leadership was doubled up to nine million dollars, and the large expansion of the company was started for all continents.
Watson is so important for the company that nearly forty years later his place in the chair of the director took his son, Thomas Watson's younger.
Under its leading IBM, it began to develop research intellectual technologies and created the first programming language.
In 1960, both IBM computers helped NASA to control space flights - to Mercurie, Saturn, and in 1969 - a human flight on Monday.
In 1964, IBM was the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of that time, named IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
After twenty years, IBM sold the production of Chinese computers from Lenovo, at the same time buying the Consultation of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus completely concluded on consulting and services with highly added value.
In the last three years, the IBM has gained great success with its concept of Smarter Planet.
It aims to use technologies in areas where this is not planned yet, and to improve the road situation and the urban management.
IBM has recently made the Smarter Commerce form, which helps businessmen to control the whole trade.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czech Slovakia, the IBM was based on its employment in 1932 as the first country of Central and East.
Today, IBM CZ is also managed by the British Autorsing Centre in Brenno.
The State of Central and Eastern State is located in Prague, where the World Level Group also works for research, which is recognised.
Records about his unbelieving man:
Iveta, leave yourself stupid, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtaržov (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richtarg (53) was a bodyguarder and lover of Evethy Bartosh (45), Darina still hoped that he would start and return home.
Yet, she doesn't want to wait anymore, and she set out clear rules for her future life.
"Papa can come home, but not as my partner," said Richtarg.
When Darina Richtarge's blood was in her home, she probably had no smaller idea of what happened to her marriage.
Although she was for Eveth to get out of Christmas 30 days later, Pepa didn't leave the song.
Moreover, he approved publicly that he loved her.
There was some time that Darin had seen that she was humble with her husband, and now she was forgiving with him.
I'm still riding with who his wife's sleeping.
Even if Richtarg and Bartosh will ever get away, his wife will not accept him with spread range.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to carry out his last days in our house, no one's going to escape him."
"The same time he ends his days, not as my favorite, lost and found old stupid, but the person with whom I am connected," said Richtarg, adding that she has already been released from her husband and is just on both occasions.
Until Joseph has nothing against his wife.
"I mean my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Evethy, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave a wedding on the boy, and I mean that decision."
"Our union continues to work; I'm responsible for the reparation, the garden, the house and the shopping."
"Darina and I communicate totally normally, but we don't share the bed anymore," said Richtarg to Blesk.
He claims that if Richtarga's most new love, he's not going to dismiss her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care about where she goes with who she has a friend.
I know that it's my fault, I loved Iveth and I've got full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst women's habits: Do they hurt you?
When you ask men to call some typical bad women's habits, they usually calculate them all.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in lines described by a few women's habits that make men hurt?
Shopping
Your second half is regreted that you're always on the stores?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to buy big sales?
If so, your shopping can be a foolish habit.
Women have recognized that they need to control their ability to shopping.
Yet, who of you will refuse to switch on clothes in search for perfectly sitting clothes and its examples (in different color options) in examples?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hair.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait for you outside...
Everlasting Deliverance
"I'm too crazy?"
"I need to get back at least five pounds -- maybe I'm starting to make a gimnasty?"
"You still get me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you enter into a group of women mixed in your outer form.
Not so that you should stop monitoring yourself, but many men have literally allergies to constant complaints of partners for their external nature.
The strong field is also aware of the fact that such complaints often occur, more women disturb them.
The most important order and cleanness
It's like an infinite story.
Moscow glass, covering with a ≥ 2 times a week.
Are you criticising your partner because he's putting a clean coffee in the crazy bottles; children's grass in pure cargo and printing fingerprints on a glass in the hotel that was so difficult to clean?
If you suffer from this "rejection", try to realize that it is not good for you to fall, and that your family doesn't have to stand in the first place.
An unusual effort to cleanness can threaten your own and the whole family.
Running to command
"Bring the white in the waste."
"You're going to put the knifes tomorrow?"
"The mocked bottle for the vessel should not be on the ground."
If you notice your partner several times a day, he can count it very pleasant.
Of course, you're good, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understand that, women wouldn't have to order them so often...
Splits
Some women like to stumble, devote and strike intrigues against others.
Women are focused on the ships, so they like to discuss who, with whom, as well as why.
A time of time, we're probably getting out of the ships.
Let's be clear, like the nature of all women.
Anyway, there are more severe sponsors, women who are often spending and disturbing others, particularly in the female slave collectives, represent a great danger for their surroundings.
Resultative Transfers of Game and Woračeca helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL Mother on Monday, two resulting transmissions of the Hockey attacker Jaromi Yagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on Carolina's ice, and he repeated the most resulting Czech Mother.
In both cases, Claude Giro was experiencing a 30-year-old star; he added another transmission and was declared by the best catch player.
Two outcome transfers were also belonging to the player in one team with Jagrom Jacob Woraček.
After Jager's mother, he told foreign journalists that he had predicted Gira a beautiful night.
"I told him before his mother, he's gonna kill heat-trick."
"I felt that."
"It's sometimes you feel like that," explained Jager, who after which Giro's killed the goal at the first occasion that Floyers gave.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "Check Track".
Harricinz Worachek, who was stumbled, had a shabby and transferred it to Talbota, who killed between the circles.
In a second before the first interruption of the home player, Patrick Duyer reduced the breakdown in a number of advantages, but at the beginning of the second and again, the Floyers.
Especially Giro.
After Jogra's resulting advice, he killed the third hole; in the next time, his attack was transformed into the fourth hole of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player of the ligue, but he's exactly entered into the three of the best," Jagger said, thanking his center.
"I'm never going to play with a shocking player like him at the end of my career."
"This makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my team companions tried to help me, and now my order has come," added Jager.
Carolina made a more drama with the Tumo Rutu and the Dwayer tools, reducing the breakdown to one hole.
The next complication prevented Me ́ Rid, which increased the breaking to two points.
"Ponger was great in our area."
"He struck the shibe, I got out, and Rid went to the long end."
"I was glad that it had been with him," he described his impression from the last hole of the bullet.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the East Conference.
The Protector of the Monreal team of Jaroslav Spachek did not end the catch with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period because of the traumatism of the body.
However, with the experienced protector of Canadians, they lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after the penalty series.
Tomash Plecanic didn't get killed during one of their attacks.
More than lost eyes, the household trainer was worried by a large quantity of trauma in the back row, since the rock was completed with five protectors.
"Situation is bad."
"We've completed the math with only one experienced player, the rest of the young people."
"Whatever, we can't do anything with this, we just need to be quiet with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Substitution by replacement, it was incredible and we couldn't resist."
"We had to ease the game, move a shib out of our area."
"What was our side," added Protector P.K.Subban
After the thirty attacks of the Czech holkiper Onjay Paulic helped Vinnipegz win Tampa Bay 5:2.
The heads of Jets, who stopped the fifth series of hurt, were killed by five different players.
Travel price dynamic since 1989
Before 1989 only five public tourist agencies could work in the former Czech Slovakia: Chedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since traveling to Western was heavy, the tourists at that time sold tourists to the country of the socialist block.
Thus, the Czech tourists were moved to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crym on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (two countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was between 1962 and 1972 when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which took the meaning of the traveling of the Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The larger paradox of the socialist was that the citizens of the block socialism (i.e. the Czech Slovakia) had not been allowed to enter into the socialist countries.
If the citizen of the Czech Slovakia wanted to move himself, for example to the Council Union or Poland, it was necessary to make a letter invitation from this country; otherwise, the individual travel was not able.
At that time, the tourist agencies had traveled to West, but they had to stand all night, with a sleeping camp, or having "good friends" to the agency.
And it wasn't everything yet.
It was necessary to move towards the West, and it was not issued to political unexpected people who had not been allowed to travel.
The Czech Slovak currency was not freely converted; without any allowance, it was not allowed to obtain money (western currency) for the west.
The most severe Czechs conducted their leaves of homes, which led to a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit is maintained today.
After 1989, the tourism in Czechland survived the actual revolution.
During 1989, the department of GDR or Bulgaria was a collection of our journeys, the last year, the Czech Republic has conducted 4.5 million departments throughout the world.
The big paradox that we do not know now is that we could not be free to visit the most popular population of Croatia until 1989, since it was part of former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for visa to the Neighbourhood of the Western country was canceled, which was the beginning of a huge wave of short traveling mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't be able to travel on the West, all wanted to go there at least for a minute.
For example, in Paris, the Czech tourists slept in parkings, because their incomes at that time were not enough for a hotel or a pension.
The typical characteristic of the Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring their own food (conserves, sales, etc.) to calculate money.
Another important moment is the introduction of freely converted Czech crown, and after decades, our tourists can buy the west currency.
Our lives and average income increased that led to another important situation in 1997.
Since 1997, a growing question allowed tourists to prepare the rule of transmissions carried out by cartridge aircrafts, compared to the past, the airports have now become unbelievable in the possibility of offering optical crashes.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czech has not needed a visa to visit almost all developed world countries, but the United States, which has made our travels further.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000, which has led to historically the first direct trip from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
With these couples, the primary cartridge is enough for the Czech tourists in warm exotic countries, which will be sent to 12 exotic directions from the Czech Republic.
Currently, about 100 thousand cheques visit exotic countries each year!
Another important event of this period, which symbolizes our development after revolution, occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States rejected the need for visits for the Czech tourists, so our country has always joined the most developed world countries.
The first in the history in 2008, more than half of their releases had been carried out out (50.3 per cent); and the first in the history, they had spent more than 15.000 crowns for humans during the release of the road, including the costs of their assignment.
The common assembly must choose the President, the threat of the pata is returned
In about five months, there was no President in the Czech football, and there is a risk that Ivan Gashak, Chapter of the Czech Football Association (FACHR) will not be called even after another extraordinary general collection in Nimburg on Thursday.
There is still no agreement on the rules of election to follow.
Without this vote, one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrich Richl, Miroslav Pelt and Thomas Paclic want to raise the Czech football.
Gashak went out from his station in June, and he invited his colleagues to join and find a person that would have a football in the future.
Nevertheless, the ear of Gashaka has reloaded the football between two association palats that cannot choose one candidate.
This was obviously on 16 September when the new president had to choose.
The delegates of the General Assembly had failed to enter the National House in Prague, Smich, since negotiations remained locked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement on the conduct of a person who had the right to vote at the general meeting - only legal representatives or officers who were granted authority.
This time was partly regulated by the Recommendation of the Government and the Rights Institute, which is not a representative of the powers granted.
The election rules are, however, continued.
The Executive Board also does not have too much help, despite its meetings, both indirect and indirect, it is mainly addressed to this issue.
The views of the ways of vote have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how to go to the 3th round and escape the path?
"The proposal is to follow the standards set out or find another model," says one of the Vice-Presidents of the FAČR Dushan Freedom, representing a professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the models provided by the statute, the winner of the 3th round is a candidate who has received great support for the hall from which he is a candidate.
As it is stated, Moravia Âna to compromise is to be the winner of the candidate elections with a maximum number of general votes in both the palats.
The Czech Party insists that at least two thirds of the votes should be made in total.
"Instead, two previous rounds would lose their meaning; that would completely reject the concept of two palats," Freedom is with the evidence of Moravia. He says that it would be better not to change rules and to vote in terms of regulations.
A few unexpectedly agreed Tomash Paclic with its opinion, although, according to the rules of choice set by, Peltu is more than other candidates.
"I would like the choices to pass by the statute."
"I want to escape all the representative's stupidity as at the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria P.P.A., who is first a candidate, and in his statements he mainly opposed Pelte.
Pelta remains optimist.
He believes that the new president will be held in Nimburg; he also hopes that the candidates will cooperate in the future.
"All emotional fractions will be satisfied after today's expected outcome of the national collection in Championato."
"Futball will be again on a happy village, people will cooperate more about," says the representative of Jablonec, which has most experiences in football management and at professional and regional levels.
Richl's more detained.
"I hope to agree, but the situation is very inequality."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but is an attempt to adjust the rules of understanding."
"It can call another broadcast of the general assembly."
"I hope a healthy sense will win," said Richle.
There was not so much time to reach agreements.
According to some information, the negotiations have passed directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether the football unit is going to be before the mob.
The additional road, which was to be delivered, besides otherwise, by the Vice-President of Dalbor Kucher and Richla to the Subborough, did not fly from Prague on the morning because of technical injustice; they wanted an alternative to provide a part of the Executive Committee to the execution of the playing catch.
Finally, the meeting at the level of the Ministry, which is expected in the environment, may be a decision.
The Ministry of Education, Young and Family, Joseph Dobesh, would like that the opposers in the country would have come to an agreement.
There are many: Governing subsidies; football creditability; and the planned common assembly of CSTV with the new Czech Directive after the financial issues of Sazki.
Paclic enters the presidential fight because he does not see the appropriate candidate
If, before the general meeting, the Chapter of Fútbolists, Tomash Pazlic had seen a strong candidate that would comply with all his requests to the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACHR), he would not even be held at a high post.
"If I had been a worth candidate, I would have seen him and I wouldn't be involved in fighting myself."
"But such a man hasn't been found," said the CZK Pacl.
Paclic's motive to fight Miroslav Pelto and Hindrich Richle is to try to resist Pelte, the preferred election fabric, to enter the FACHR.
Moreover, Paclic highlights that, in the case of winning, he remains president only until 2013, when the general assembly was planned.
In the future, he would like this post to take a experienced top manager, not too much with football life.
"I've spoken to several people that could be mentioned."
"I was worse to hear how some of them said that they wouldn't even want to have regard to the Czech football at this time."
"I would like to change this opinion," he said.
The main distortion of Paclic with Pelta is now with the recent relations with Roman Berbro, the President of the Regional Football Association in Pulzene.
As a result, Paclic is considered unacceptable to be the President of Pelta.
"If he wins the current situation will remain without change and the football will not move forward."
"Berbra's support, a potential businessman, would be even more harder for the football," Pazlic said.
He claims that the name of Pelty was recorded a few years ago when listening to the phones in the investigation of corruption; Pelte was able to escape the proceedings.
"I don't know what Pelta's victory would bring to the football."
"And how we would look in the eyes of the EUFA and the FIFA," Pazlic said, "and he now does not mention his previous statement that he will "sell the P'yen club if Pelta becomes the President."
If Paclic wins Thursday, he could continue to cooperate with Pelta in the future.
This opinion divides another candidate, Ryan, whom Pazlic supported before the universal congregation in September, which ended fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would turn."
"He's very powerful."
"I can put it in the head of the collection."
"But he can't manage association."
"I don't also have my nose in what I don't understand," said Pazlic, which brought a large number of attention to himself in September, when he supported the elimination of the courtyard's brigade, headed by the Mandec Macelo, who changed Dagmar Damkov.
Paclic admits that he will risk the management of the association.
He has been responsible for his experience of the management of private companies; since the past year, he has managed the PIAYIN team, which has led its first triumph to the ligue.
"I have power to make the football environment changing, supporting its changes to the best."
"To limit the impact of some groups of persons who are able to affect the disciplinary and applause advice that leads to distorting situations," Pazlic said, "he does not hide his antipathia, for example, to the director of the Sparta Daniel Crjettinski.
One of its priorities will strengthen relations between the FACHR and the Czech Olympics Committee, with which it will help it to cover a higher political level of money for sports from lottery collections.
"This is one of the key moments that the new president should take place."
"If taxes are charged by azart games, as political partys are approved, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly declare where money will go," he said.
Paclic does not consider its relationship with the P'yen Club as a burden, although he claims that President FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's with the Jablonic, and Rail with the Prague Duckloy.
"It's not a perfect option."
"And yet I don't see the meaning of my hypocrisy transmission of the P's club's action to someone else, when I'm going to go back there for six months," says Pazlic.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that allow the Election Path to escape
In two days before the general football association meeting, one of the candidates in the president, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if it was chosen, he would follow the new rules of the FACHR to avoid the election rules in the future.
Before negotiations on Thursday in Nimburg, Jablonez's officer remains optimist and believes that the attention to the pre-experimental fight will be felt of today's expected success of our football collection.
Before prejudiced elections in September, Pelta promised that if he wins, he is focused on the representation and the receipt of financial funds.
He decided to participate in the elections at the last time before the last common assembly, so a dual-month delay could be for him to maintain his ideas of football in a larger context.
"The people at all levels have been in the football for a long time, and they expect the President to be held on Thursday."
"They feel that it is the same time for a person to take up a partner," said a person, mainly with the Jablonian club; but he has spent a lot of years in Sparta and the Executive Association Committee.
This gives him the ability to assume that he is sufficiently experienced to manage the Czech football.
He believes that the current issues are caused by the Ephory, which was ruled in the time of Ivan Gashek.
"The rules that were not so complied as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If the various ways of representation were not adopted, we would have been presidents since September," Pelta said.
It refered to the rescription of the key document of civil association as a false objective for delegations.
"If I become the President, I will consider this my personal task, and I will take my own responsibility if this trial is insufficient."
"This is the fundamental question we can't be able without," says Pelt.
Besides, he says he doesn't try to put himself on the background of the opposers.
In the past, he had already stated that he could have been able to cooperate with Yindrich Richle, whom he appreciated for the educational law; he fully realized that his candidate should be his first vice-president.
For a long time, he had not attacked Thomas Paclic, who continued to criticize Pelt.
"He's in the football more than a year and has been successful."
"Whatever, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people surprised the methods of his pre-election campaign."
"And therefore, some of them are now doubting about his true identity," Pelt said about his competitor, and he himself says that he is faithful to the declarations that he declared in September.
It considers its main arm of the knowledge of the football from the lowest level to the national collection.
The national collection must represent the whole football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the cases of persons or the consequences of the last year corruption scandal."
"Instead, I would focus on negotiations and private and public sectors to guarantee sufficient amount of money for all football," said the CTC two months ago.
Then he promised that his election to the post of the football head would not be able to release the staff.
"I will need to know the Offices and Actions of the Departments." It was his sentence to the Strach, where the intergovernmental period has made sense of nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophe scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not come to Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only question is how to make elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"Futball needs confidence that he can receive, only from the end of his leader," says Pelt, who remains optimist in two days before his worker's key day.
Richle promises that the FACHR will start actively working on its leadership
If the Vice-President of the Czech Football Association is held on Thursday, many people in the Association will be inappropriate.
Ryan promises that if they choose him, it's gonna be time for hard work.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the area of the football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the ́emers; to improve the EUFA and the FIFA; more money to football; and to continue with the previous President Ivan Gashak.
"As the President, I would like to focus on the football at all."
"From contact with EUFA and FIFA, to national collection, professional football and football activities for young people."
"I don't want to say that I'm going to do everything myself," said Richle in his interview for the CTK.
"I am a commander, and I want to determine the powers in the Executive Committee so that each member of the focus may be in a specific area."
"I'll determine the tasks so that the football will make great steps in each of these segments."
"It is probably not like many people, because it will mean a difficult person, not just a criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of the criticism in the football movement is supposed to be doubted of its candidate.
"I think I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know whether there is any meaning in this; and that I will not be circumcised by people who put me in the wheel and put my doubt every step," he explained his own doubts.
"Now, many people told me that I shouldn't think, else they'll come."
"This confidence I can't reject," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue what he started with Gashake.
"The smaller number of works has been done for the two years, and I don't want to remark all of this."
"The processes that could result in several years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be chosen, the situation in the Association could return to the situation that was to Gashak.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and this is what the Mirek Pelt's competence is."
"He is surrounded by people who would work with football so that he could only be accessible for the chosen."
"I can be accused of much, but it is not exactly in subsidiarity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football available to everyone, because then everyone will take a good time, not just a chosen minority," said Ryan.
Moreover, he rejects the accusation that he is only the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to confirm the contrary, I'm planning to make a Ma'am for Moravia."
"For example, it was time to deal with the second line in the Czech and the More Sections that the winners would continue to fight in the first League."
"This will prevent the present situation when there are only three moral teams that are a problem for young players in Moravia," said Ryan.
While the Officer of the P's Club of Thomas Pazlic has entered in the Presidency Conflict, Rayhl does not have any reason to appreciate its chances of winning.
"Instead, I still feel the support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen my vice-president, and I see that I have reached some clear success," said Ryan. For his success he will make the economy of decades of millions of crowns on unusual contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he is partly guilty of the unity in association.
Acknowledging that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning the Czech football credit," he considers another partner, Paclic, a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he was greatly in Plzena this year."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashak has started, without ambiguous changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't delay the facts for his benefit," said Richl about his companion.
The most beautiful bases
Get in the water
Julia Stanek
Children with universal volcano optical and statutory bases in Budapest, and travelers can test out of the incredible waters, and injury the body in jacuz after the town's excursion or in the crossing.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder couldn't work during his investigations in the last half year: without his purchasing costume.
It is on the waters, she looks up on the top of the cocktails of the cow, flew to the marmorous cherubs waiting for it at the end of the basin, and loved the highly restored blue basens in the ar-nuvo style.
It was to add each favorite basen to its block, with important details about the building and history of the translation.
The story of the Mediterranean review of more than 200 flat baseners - and now he collected impressions in its recent book of Badefreuden (Badefreuden) where all came from public basens in Munich to historical shopping courts in the Black Forest and "functional betons" in Taunus.
Her "traveling in the most important bathrooms in the Central Area" has been carried through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited a bathroom in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and in one town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old author is a real enthusiasm of purchasing culture.
She's experienced very little enthusiasm, says Meder, but it's different in water.
The only deficiency is that flowers must be peaceable with the blue coffee and chloride, while the flights can breathe with a swimming deepness of the forests or listen to the joyful birds in the park.
"At the time I asked myself why the bassians should always be so terrible," says Vene Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful bases."
When the surrounding is depressed
The flashing in the bassin and searched oil in the saun is a raw factor in the bathroom because the Meder views that all feelings are stimulated.
And the basin can be a real pleasure for the eye if the builders take such work on themselves. "You have the surface of water in the base."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beautifulness of the whole term."
Everything is clearly reflected: high pools, coloured fibres and tramps.
The 190 pages illustrated in the Building Rate contain a valuable information on the →Ecttural and Cultural Health History - and you want to get into water.
The Meder water collector discovered several exemplary issues during the investigation in Hungary.
She discovered the rich nitrates of water in the cart (Mishkolz-Tapolce) and the terminal bathroom, filled with hedge water, in the building built in the form of bottle (Városi Termal Kundö in Jasʹne), as well as beautiful therapeutic bags, such as 100-year-old sequences in Budapest.
Many open basens in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, are opened by a species. You can see the whole Cyrch from the bathroom on the coast or look at the destructed Arlberg from the open base in Sankt Antone. And there is a window in the park that allows you to see what happens on the league.
The most normal design is expected to buyers in Langenfeld, which looks like NLOs, just the landscape in Alpha.
The winter is raised up by a couple of three open cancers, which seems to be very small at the Ectal Mountains' background.
Albamber in Svartzwalde
The basener Meder's college has not met the chlorides in each base.
Many terms of building will be thrown up to severe. The purchase names of Arpad in Bequessabe are so broken up with oil that you may be difficult to believe that you are in a healthy source.
The water is nearly black from the skin, as you are threatening to the bassin, and the water is nearly black from the skin.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at a certain moment in her search for nice characters for buying, and when she tried to visit the open Czech Building Bassin in Lugaczovica, she discovered that the territory was printed.
Building projected by Dushan Jurkovich in 1902 was closed.
When Meder looked in the species of a red-white-black window in the style of ar-nuvo, she saw the rubbers between the coffee fibres.
One of the areas where the disruption was stopped on warming tracks, a wonderful floating bassin in Svartzwald, a Bad Wildbad Termwater County.
The Bassians have already passed through three stages of building, and you will find not only the non-Roman elements of the period after building in 1844, but also the Mauritanian Hall in the Algabra style, approximately 1900.
After the deep river in 1995, the Termal County is a favorite floating bassin of Iris Meder basin, not only because it is a generation from Svartzwald.
"This is a real achievement, so masterly to compute such different →tectural styles," says Meder.
It is evidently a second-speed employment to the terminal basen in such a court.
Speculation of agricultural production
Doce Bank investigates the trade of agricultural production.
Christian Tyves
Will Doyce Bank stop trade in agricultural production?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann’s slaves group for the investigation of the consequences of the speculation for the poor people around the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For the German citizens, the situation is clear, and 84 per cent of Germans believe that the banks are not acceptable for agricultural production, such as birds and sugar.
Two thirds are required to stop trade in agricultural production by Doyce Bank and other banks, since the trade has lost the problems that stand before the poorest people worldwide.
The conclusions were carried out in the investigation carried out by the Forsa Institute and the Statistics of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in the middle of October.
The report author, Garald Schuman, demonstrates that the world-wide prices and banks are so involved in the world's hunger.
The Consumer's interest protection campaign directly addresses Doyce Bank Joseph Akkerman, although major banking houses such as Godman Sax and Morgan Stanley are traded in the same way.
In particular, the taxes on the goods were considered as a means for the protection of trademakers from the price covering.
Anyway, most experts are now that players have rejected the rules of proposal and question and are used for the most poor.
In contrast with competitors in the United States, Akkerman responded to criticism, promised to investigate complaints and stated that no trade was worth to risk the good reputation of Doyce Bank.
In SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international slave group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed until the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Doyce Bank, with recommendations for the implementation.
The Chapter of the Bank then plans to announce changes followed by the investigation at the end of January.
The trade of goods may be reduced or completely interrupted.
Ackerman works on his imagination.
The President of Foodwatch Tylo Bode welcomed the newspapers underlined its claim to the financial sector. "Financial price rates are an example of how the banks are currently against general interests."
As the main bank lobby at Akkerman, there is a certain responsibility, according to Bode's opinion.
"Bank's grandmother must remove all investments that make money taxes for food prices from the portfolio," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter, and whether to say about hungry people or Reputation of Doyce Bank."
Ackerman's quick reaction to sleep, but the director would like to have an unprecedented bill for a few months before his stay in the office.
Doce Bank announced on Monday that the president would not enter into the supervisory Council as planned.
The refusal of an emergency dispute on the product market could improve its immigration.
He must also be able to forget the expenditure - the consequences of his deputy.
Each second would refuse investment in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet operators have joined the organization's campaign today.
Bode reported the study on Thursday, investigation was carried out for the Forsa Institute and the analysis statistics on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that investments that make a price of the product are acceptable for Doyce Bank.
Many banking clients would also take specific steps to find out that their bank is in such trade, and each other would, according to the investigation, reject the contributions that finally result in the speculation of goods.
43 per cent would recommend to leave the bank, 49 per cent said that the conclusion of the account and transition to another bank.
Home of the 21th century in Vienna
Pavilion on the New Family
Ingeborg Vinsovski
The architectural story with appeals, falls and happy ends. The Pavilon of Austria for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels was injured, a museum in Vienna was destroyed and disrupted.
Now they open it again as an exhibition center.
The Pavilon of Austria, designed by Carl Swanzer for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels, is an example of modern follow-up-up forms of his simple forms, steady halls, who have expressed faith in technical progress.
Pavilon Swanzer was charged by Gran-Pri on the Ectature in 1958 for his chair and steel cup.
The C.E. is considered to be a vicious in the modern ecstasy.
This has made the Ombudsman such as he also built an Austrian pavilion on the World Exhibition.
Finally, he celebrated the whole world in 1973 with its four-cylinder BMW and her sister in the form of the coast.
Pavilon, who was transferred to the Swiss garden around the South Venezuela, was transformed and opened as Museum in 1962 - and often mentioned as the "Home of the 20th century" for this reason.
Anyway, there were no walls in which there could be experience and bad air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until the modern experience in Vienna has received a new home.
The house was devastated since 2001, and it became worse and worse.
architect Adolf Crishanitz at the present repository of Pavilion, called "Home of the 21th century" and will be used as a Museum of modern experience.
This Museum is the Balveder Museum, which will open the first issue on Thursday evening, in all senses the joyful event.
Agnes Husslain-Arco, who became a new director of the Austrian Gallery of Belveder in 2007, contributed to a new beginning.
Husslain-Arko, a student of the history of experiences with a brilliant career of youth figures that worked in Sotheby's, the Guggenha Museum, and then became the founder and the Museum Modernity Museum in Zalzburg, convinced politicians and conservators to continue recycling, attached public funds and private funds and decided how it would be used.
The new museum had to include a continuous exhibition of the Freez Watruba Foundation, coffee and booking magazine in accordance with modern experience, and it had to be built officerly from.
Strengthening & budgetary control
Crishanitz was then an ideal candidate to implement the project.
He was seemed to be able to restore and expand the Venice Session of Joseph Olbrich and wins a competition, but he also learned at the Swander at the Venice University of Technology, and Pavilon was "essentially important place" for him, where he visited the exhibitions "may every week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that were standing before, with a part of its easilyness and easilyness, when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that occurred at the last restructuring were far more serious, and there was a "Energy Energy Energy Forest", says Crishanitz.
Eye profiles on the steel phase were replaced, inserted with a strengthened steel-secure glass, and the steel glass was replaced by a high-speaking steel.
The translation of the heavy pool was strengthened or replaced, and the asbest was removed from the pools.
Two below stages have created a space for new use of the conference, a flaming light cow between the Property and the street provides for the Property - practically new, but still the eating pavilion of Swanzer.
The origin of the external doors were stored, and it was cut off in an old red-corn color of the protection of the corrosion.
Holly cinemateater is the same as it was before.
All of this is in a close control of the musical management and with the budget.
"We often had to find material that was a good, deep, and would be approved by the Music Management," said the Crishanitz, indicating the nervous injury in the bathroom.
Although problems, problems and conversions remained in the area of the world, it remained increasing and increasing.
Crishanitz recently noted that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a crub -- a typical story of "capley in the town".
Such a "not always on its own" entity, however, wants to " stimulate the actual knowledge".
The house of the 21th century is in a very proper manner, since in the planning of the city an unexpected success has occurred.
The 21th century's house may be completed in the second place with the Christianity, the French Collectionary of the Gabsburg's Temporary Exhibition Room of Berlin, and, as it is reported, negotiations with the city on its neighborhood in the Switzerland Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion winter anticrisis package
Deutsche Bahn discovered an anticrisis plan to escape the refusal of the winter.
The number of persons should be increased both.
The losses are millions.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will have more than 70 million in this year to escape winter refuses and late feeds.
By submitting to the Deutsche Bahn internal anticrisis plan, the newspaper Bill reports that investments were planned by about 300 million by 2015.
Investments are intended to increase the ability of locomotives and railway networks even in extreme conditions.
The number of own and accessible holdings of snow with roads and forms will be increased to 16,000.
It is intended to clean the forms from snow and ice until the start of work and 90 per cent of the arrows for four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, chapter Deutsche Bahn, warned about the possibility of refusing and lacking the winter's feed at meeting with Government and Industrie members two months ago.
The last winter Deutsche Bahn experienced the meaning of the difficulties with passports, since she had no reserves at the time of the deterioration.
Many new regional feeds in the year were expected to be approved by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays with ICE feeding.
Deutsche Bahn also had been more frequently checking the ICE's axes after one of the ICE's trains was broken at the main box in Kelne.
Docce Bank will pay a lot of million dollars in the United States.
The new challenges were followed by the challenges around Joseph Akkerman, Director-General Doyce Bank: Doyce Bank is increasing in the United States for millions of sterling pounds.
According to Doyce Bank, there was a little problem in the family, the past industrial gigant in the United States has now distorted it. Doyce Bank with a quarter stab in Frankfurt will pay 145 million dollars (106 million) to rejoice on the complaints coming after bankroot during the financial crisis of five major credit unions.
The problem has occurred around the sale of hypothecological obligations.
The national credit union management (CUA), the financial market regulator, claims a number of larger banks that they have concluded false promises in order to engage credit unions to buy their financial products.
The valuation of obligations was strictly fallen during the financial crisis and decreased the credit unions.
"We are glad that we have resolved this problem without taking parts into court," said the representative of Doyce Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not recognize his fault.
The same is the same for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the operational reaction of both banks.
The national credit union management (CUA) is responsible for the United States credit unions and is involved in the bankroad processes in order to protect consumers' contributions.
The NCUA fights for the compensation of the income from the billion.
It's the first agreement of such a kind.
The regulator also focused on other largest banks and was aware of JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suppose of hypothetic obligations are the so-called prices of papers guaranteed by the poultry of hypothetic credits.
They are supported by the internal.
This has decided to judge a number of financial companies when the market of insecurity was thrown in the United States in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered to live long in September 2008 on the grave of financial crisis.
A few years later, the banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims, needed to pay or pay compensations.
The Federal Agency for the Construction of Area (FHFA) has the most important claims.
It accuses 18 major banks that they have been acquired by the American credit organisations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Doyce Bank also stands before the threat of the consequences of the FHFA under many agreements on a total value of 14,2 billion dollars held between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the stab-quarters bank in Frankfurt take a responsibility for "the losses" but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
Douce Bank rejected the claims as unbased and reported that they would be deprived.
Warren Baffet contributes 10 billion to IBM
The Financial Guru Baffet is actively invested in the IBM IT company.
Since March he bought shares for over 10 billion dollars.
Before these, the major American investor Warren Baffet has always stated that he does not invest in computers and IT companies, since their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the annual IBM report changed its opinion on investments in this growth.
According to Baffet, he had to have been very earlier to understand that the IBM would first carry out services and buy computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
Warren Baffet's investment in the financial world was considered as a ricer.
IBM, a veteran IT-research, has now received the title "Sir IBM".
The CNBC Baffet interview reported that since March he received IBM action for $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest holders of IBM action under 5.5 per cent.
Boffet said that even IBM had not known anything about his participation.
He praised the manager that could be reached even during the financial crisis.
"They made great," said Baffet, meaning the manager.
The IBM's significant time was focused on IT-services such as date.
A computer-based growth, who has been more than 100 years of age, is to provide programming and consultation services, as well as powerful business computers.
By this time, the Baffet has avoided technology companies.
He said he was investing only in the company whose business he understands.
and investment, for example, in carriage, in the production of wheel materials and in machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway has parts in a long list of largest companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (ex-Münchener Back) and about 80 of its own daughters.
81-year-old Berkshire Hathaway received a small textile company in the 1960s and built one of the lovers of the world.
His form of life, however, remained humiliated,
By making it a cool figure for an innumerable investor throughout the world.
It's almost an unfortunate instinct in making money brought him the "Oracula from Omai".
The IBM action price increased to one per cent before the markets were opened after the Baffet investment announcement.
"Golubay gigant", as IBM is still called, is over 220 billion dollars on the foundation, which makes it one of the lovers of the highest technological companies of the world according to Apple and Microsoft.
But Baffet said he wouldn't invest in Microsoft.
She's the foundation of Bill Gates, his close friend.
Unsupported danger
The Turkish SMEs were doubted at the law of Germany after the "Cells in Chuckau".
One of the newspapers refers to "the blood ideology", which is now up to the surface.
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek business between 2000 and 2006 was the result of the right extremist idea.
Furthermore, fear and empathy have become a response to this message in Turkey and in Germany and Turkey community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has long forgotten fears.
There was no doubt that xenofobie in Germany existed.
However, the right-extreme network now found has a scale that is not yet completely comprehensive.
"Firmation of blood ideology?" was the title of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah Gazeta, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informed of secret services, and expresses concern that German authorities could be in the right-extremist pain.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) repairs quietly by mixing the victims of racial hatred with silent pickets against the Brandenburg gates in these outcomes.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at the ceremony with the participation of German and Turkish policies has rejected the fifty-year-year-old German and Turkish bilateral agreement on the most powerful servants.
The cooperation between two countries was presented in the light - as a success story.
"The gift from Germany to the fifty-year" was the name of one of the articles on the Turkish Portal of Haber X, the commenting situation of a series of murder.
The German issue of Hürriyet also did not lose the case of this parallel.
"It's starting bad" is the name of Ahmath Kulahji.
He notes that people who have been killed and contributed to Germany ' s conversion.
Police behavior and successful areas have been criticized by the German and Turkish forums.
The authors questioned why the German authorities did not think before to follow the suspicious areas in the right-streaming circles.
The authors have reached a long term of ritoric. "If they will continue to do the same inevitable, the migrants will have no other choice except the armed self-defense."
"This will be the best self-defense."
"The peace in Germany is very dependent on how the whole network will be hidden and from the right of punishment," says Selen.
The crimes in Melna and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the world in Germany under threat.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply impressed in the memory of Germans and Turkish.
No other events showed the Turks that there is a danger to them, but the Germans that uncertainty and equality can be in real violence.
However, these crimes increased the feeling of the unity of Turkey.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press in that period was primarily condemned by the German police failure after attacks. Helmut Cole refused to visit the overseer in Melne.
He sent a telegram of disturbance to the President of Turkey after subcutaneous consumption in Zolingen, but the participation in the memory ceremonie in Kelne accepted his Minister for Foreign Affairs Claus Kinkel-Kinkel, in his case, recalled taxes which Turkey had made in Germany,
as he determined the value of man by taxes he would.
Today, the Turkish SMEs have shown again how many German Turkish Turks were deceived from that point to the current German State.
It clearly showed that it was necessary to do now, outside the efforts to detect and re-evaluate the right-extreme terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bankovski scandal on the Siurich Lake
Most risked bank policies are not in France or in Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS’s food has not been distorted during the financial crisis, and it is unexpectedly fighting with the other, then with the other crisis.
Now the German must be returned to the faithful course.
Alex Veber must have not doubted that he would have this role.
In July, after his effective outcome from Chapter Chapter of the Federal Bank, it was declared that it would begin in 2013 at least effective post - the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS of the Greatest Switzer Bank; an unexpected and achieved carrier trip.
Alex Webber was clearly in a spectacular way, praised Switzerland for her beautifulness, UBS for the renewable reading and made a few friendly comments in the address of his future colleagues.
"UBS has been changed to best."
"I'm with patience waiting for the opportunity to meet Casper Phileger and Oswald Grubel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would be different.
Traider UBS in Londres enhanced the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswald Grubel, a bankier not only in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the Board of Directors of UBS is considered sick, and everyone wants to know: When will Alex Veber finally enter his post?
Weber should consult the bank from February 2012.
And, as the bank stated on Monday, the President of the Council will take it already in May, not in 2013.
It's not easy for Alex Veber.
He is a Professor of the Economy and the Centre Bank's Specialist, not a traditional bankier, and he will certainly need time for adaptation.
In time, he was responsible for a bank, which again proved that he had deserved the call "the greatest bank scandal in the Property".
The UBS, on the one hand, has been very large - until recently - and he has been managed by the most important assets in the world - and he is not out of the scandal for years.
It seems that a fierce Swiss bank doesn't hurt anything.
Everything started during financial crisis.
Before 2007, UBS had a reputation.
The bank agreed with the image of a hidden and sustainable, but at the same time, the fishing assets manager with ambassador objectives and the desire to become the greatest player in the investment banking.
In 2007, the UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more customers than any other bank in the world,
and as a investment bank entered the largest world banks.
That was a impression.
Hans Gayger, an ex-banker and a banking professional, who has long been trained at the Institute of the Banking Affairs of the University of Zurich, explains: "I have always brought UBS students as a model of a good bank."
"You know what we know now, you can ask me how I could be wrong."
He really wronged.
Only in 2007, it was clear that something was wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, the Executive Director Peter Woffley, who was considered a publishing intellectual, and at the same level the banking, was unexpectedly out of his staff.
A few months later, we were able to imagine why he went away.
The bank's investment department tried to play on substantive value papers and had to write a billion.
You want to believe that you want not, but UBS reported the increase of capital to 13 billion Swiss French to resist the crisis.
Bank actually found investors - but investors from which many bankers would have rejected recently - one very untransparent Asian Sovereign Fund from Singapore and one Arab Sovereign Fund, hidden so much that his name was not reported.
It was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it became much worse.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, and the President of the Board of Directors of Marsel Ospel, the second on the payment level of the president of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, in 2006, was rejected.
In October 2008, the UBS was a disaster, because of the lack of investments during the financial crisis, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank purchased the UBS price papers for the untitled quantity of billion, and the Swiss Conference paid six billion Swiss French for the conversion of the commitment to be a owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was in shock: the country recognized the dramatic consequences of that large banks were based in a small country.
Finally, the UBS final balance in 2007 was five times more than all Switzerland production (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says the bank analytical Gayger.
The second catastrophe was in the first place.
A few months later, UBS chapters of the US tax and stated that he was ready to transfer data from stated customers, which may be using the bank from taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay 780 million dollars from the refund of unfair income from business and staff.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was a instrument for derogation from taxes.
At the same time, the UBS lost that it had always been the privilege of combating rich customers, a secret degree.
After that, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairperson of the Board of Directors were afterwards rejected, and
It started the outcome of customers' money.
In several months, the bank lost confidence in both main directions of its activities - in investing for failure speculations and the management of assets in the way of assisting and promoting the derogation of taxes.
And it was just quiet, and it seemed that UBS could overcome the situation of this disaster with an agency-treeder, and the single treader sent 1,7 billion before the bank noted something wrong.
Clearly, the management of risks in investment is not yet working.
"The incident with Ahaboly clearly showed that risk control was insufficient," said Martin Jansen, Professor of Economy and Finance in the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The Financial Director of one of the largest German banks also doubts: "The UBS problem is that he has no instrument to control risks."
Exactly warning has been made by Swiss banks for a long time by keepers of the world's greatest assets - not for a risk, but for the security of money, unless the world was devastated by the Alpian Republic.
The Swiss bank seats have become a symbol of uncertain confidence, such as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolizes a depressed cuss in the chocolate.
The UBS apartment in Zürich to this point corresponds to the image of a Swiss private bank, but it's a little more.
It's a classic place.
The Chief Bank office is located in Zurich in Banghofstrass, which is from the main box directly to the Turkish Lake, around the snows of the Swiss mountains.
The views are fair, and the rate of the bills for the stores is one of the highest of the Property.
In the middle of the traditional Swiss magazines of the type Confiserie Sprüngli here, you can find youths such as Tiffany's.
The Swiss banks were available here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Crade Suis court, and of the Elite private banks, such as Julius Ber.
The hard door is in the UBS newsbook.
The walls covered by the walls are a large skin whispers.
UBS knows what his clients need, is confidence.
But both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some time refused the Swiss understanding of the banking - or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks, they had delivered them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper -- like all Swiss banks, he also works with two major banks.
He believes UBS is too large, particularly in the investment banking, where very active anglosexes are.
His opinion, the Swissers have nothing to add here.
"And if there is something, they have been adapted to English habits for a long time."
The UBS has actually changed the UBS investment banking, brought him the first large arrival - and then fiasco - and no other financial institution has lost so much money in substantive assets jungles as the major Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became obvious on 15 October 2008.
"In that environment, the coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people has undertaken a major salvation of oper in the history of the country," wrote Lucas Hassig in his book UBS.
Politicals approved 68 billion Swiss French (environmental 45 billion) to save banks from bankroot.
How could it be?
If the Swiss banks ask, they will say that the problem is mainly in the size of UBS.
Two of the three major Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
The bank was created, which was too large for the small Switzerland at the time of the smoking, and the bank that continued to grow.
This helped also that two banks, UBS, were added to each other, one was a rich but gradual bank specialised in Zurich for the management of assets; another was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers immediately received access to the large number of money they could use to cross the highest road.
Two names with UBS growth: Peter Wolfley, the Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, president of the Board of Directors.
"I always believed that Wolfley and Ospel were a mention team," says the bank analytical Hans Gayger.
"Wolffley, who has been published intelligently, humble and deeply understanding models and statistics, and Ospell with his internal instinct, who has passed all the way over, starting with the stage in the bank."
But the Spell finally became Wolfley.
And Wolfley could make a critical error. "He thought his models were real," says Gayger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragical.
Holyness is before the hurt.
The UBS are well remembering the meetings of members of the Government where Wolfley has always repeated the same louzing - to promote Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he named the "turn table" where the banks were successful.
UBS wanted to go to the most of this table.
He's got to make part of this way.
UBS was the greatest player in the trade of monetary and public valuable papers.
The authorised advisers on management issues, however, indicated to the place of holding, and then the parameter called "constant income" in bank terms was far behind the most major banks.
UBS had fallen in American hypothetic products.
To shut up the cup, UBS joined the avanture that the food was not worth his life.
As a result of growth, their own banks and the had fund invested in American substantive prices.
This has been developed in a large mechanism that united the price papers on American hypothectic credits and sold them further - continued to carry out risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to get out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS buyed up until 2007 when the American insurance market was already in the fire," says the bank analytical Gayger.
As far as it grows, the deepest fall.
One manager had to go as soon as an effort to bring the bank into order was more difficult than seemed to be dreamed.
Posts to UBS have been converted into a staff game and remain unexpected until this day.
Anyone who is in charge of this great bank is almost unnecessary.
He has to find a position for a bank who returned to all business models.
The Bank Analysis of Gayger has already a idea - to refuse the investment banking, to focus on the management of assets and to forget its Swiss roots.
Bank, but it's not ready to go so far.
However, it is obvious that investment activities must be completely consumed.
The new chapter of Sergio Ermotti's bank plans to make its future on Thursday.
The 51-year-old Italian bankier was actually considered as a temporary decision when the bank was unexpectedly dismissed with his former Grubel.
In the past, he had been able to show the character and now, as the Tyrish bank stated on Thursday, UBS is on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to the status in which he was in the middle of the 1990s.
He reduces 3500 slaves.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How is he planning to work money?
These questions are probably giving him Axel Weber.

Thinking walls fill cities
The players are considered difficult for birds in many places, and experts today say that these whole smart birds will not be able to get out of towns.
They loved birds, others wanted to be released as soon as possible.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, is far away.
At the first symposium of the dedicated bodies, experts in Lear in East Frisie claimed that the Greeks would not have been able to get out of towns.
Specialists throughout Germany discussed decisions.
Searching for alternatives in towns
Conservationists claimed that the root of the problems in the towns was in migration of the protected players, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was more disrupted by the traditional residence areas.
Ohota, extending the building and exhaustion of traditional trees, has complicated the lives of birds.
The walls are under protection.
In the city of West in Westphalia and northwest in Jere, Dipholce, Achim under Bremen and Lere, there are large initiatives that contain more than 600 parents.
The unexpected draft shooting in Lere expressed the incompatible titles of the newspaper in 2005.
The critics described the fishing of birds in the cattle and the loss of their hairs as an agency.
"The general movement and disappointment don't give anything." said the Developer and the Landscape Designer Verner Clever from Lera.
The rain of water flows or trees often have recent consequences, said an expert on the environmental protection of Manfred Caiser from Lara, Baden-Würtemberg.
"The lives are divided, and large areas are divided and spread into other areas."
Anxiety is possible only in the form of exception with hospitals, older and school houses.
"We have to live with them, not a warrant."
The problem in the cities will not be solved in the areas of the surrounding areas, says Mr. Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The summary of fearing birds from the need to protect resident areas and encourage them to return to other areas could be an outcome.
"It's walls instead of benzopile" was a louzing proposed by psychology and the etnology of Utho Maria Yurgens, which is a completely different approach to birds. "We must be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the foundations of the educational railway road in Asherberg in Shleswig Golstein, where there is information on the instruction scenes on the life of all thoughts.
The project is already interested in tourists.
Jurgens also has his opinion on the claims of a wheel produced by birds. "They have to tell each other much."
The wheat and the smile of these birds have been entered into the engines, and the players often use not only the orbits to be able to acquire those who are stumbled, but also make orudies themselves.
The conduct researchers at the Cambridge University recently protested the measure of birds at four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they had to go through the dog to get a person in prayer.
Without training, they recognized the size and form of stone that was necessary to cut down the rain.
In another experiment, comparative players had to resolve a more complex task.
The researchers made a small wheel with personal prayer in a vertical cycle.
The birds couldn't get a kitchen.
But the investigators gave them a kitchen.
All four birds were used with a wheel to make rubbers and ispose, so that they would be thrown out of the cyclindra.

Mass killings - A measurement
The pressed and very good new book of Peter Anglound: The personal history of the First World War, begins with a long whisper of persons from whom the heart dies.
This is the advice to read further: Close this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will know these people very closely as Mr. Englond's order, and this list of persons will be your GPS, your mother at the moment when, like one of these men and women, you will go from the road and lose in the war tuman.
Mr. Anglend is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new continuous Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which is the Nobel Prince for Literature.
The book he wrote now, is unusual, he describes it, sufficiently exactly as "Anti History".
It contains little names, important treaties or battles; there is almost no jobs, journalists or discussions of taktics and fighting techniques.
It is not so much about what it was - he explains how much "the book of what it seemed to be" is about " feelings, impressions, anxieties and the status of the spirit."
The book "Crasota and bbb" with the only military experience of 20 years of military experience, more or less notable men and women, both sides of the front, from schools and scientists to alpinists, doctors, leaders of quick assistance and servants.
These people will become heroes.
Someone's going to fall into the wheat, lose his hand or his leg, or die.
They live here as church lights: news are added to the ability of others, and some are at the same time.
Mr. Anglound's book is the outcome of the standard of historical books.
This is the amendment to imagine that the First World War was only a heavy armed war on the Western front.
"Crasota and rub" are wisely given to other military theaters: Alp, Balkan, Eastern Franth, Opotomia, East.
The soldiers in this book are understood by the birds; one of them meetings the Birthday in Egypt under pyramides; the unsolved problem is the mosque.
It's a worrying book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such as the Uranian Katrina, who is inspired by an immortal distress.
When the canon is nearly heard, and you are a woman and you are home with children, you stay on or you're going to escape?
So or else, who's that?
Almost no one understands what's happening and why to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," notes Mr. Anglend, "is fulfilled by opinions, suggestions, hopes, fears, relating ideas, theories of negotiations, mysteries, coasts and listeners."
"Crasota and bbb" is the judgement of people such as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German Float Sea.
Their history is primarily taken from memorandums, letters and other materials already listed.
The stories of their lives may be able or capable, but they are at the highest level alive in the small moments and detailed details of Mr. Englond.
Many of them are about the independences and how to cope with them.
He tells the history of the German school, he says, "Erzaz, every tears."
"Substitute coffee, subdivisional aluminium, unusual raw, paper connections, wooden powder."
He's still talking about the beach-beach in Germany.
It describes "meat of the grassed wheat, covered in the wheat (and covered by the fake bone made of the tree); the tape made of dry roots and dry cartoffle skin; the bowls of the tree."
He notes that "837 registered meat replacements authorised in the production of colba, 511 registered coffee replacements."
History reports honesty and honesty.
One American observes the weight of violence and says about the war, "You feel that, finally, it is what men have been created, not to sit in good chairs with cigarettes and whiskys, even a newspaper or a besteller, and say that this show is civilization, and that there is no warfare under your screened rubber."
In contrast, the British soldier notes that he will die, and no one will not notice it or grieve.
"When a person humbles with the thought of self-deduction, he would like to think that it was happening before p," he wrote.
But it's in contrast, it's like a "promised person who is secret."
Other comments are given to the old, devastated, and the new forms of fear.
"Conflict has become more economically involved," says Mr. Englond, "armoking."
He notes the arrival of one who calls "a new species in the beginning age: beautiful and ideologically convicted mass killer in a well-sheeted coast, which sets the rock outside the written table."
Humans are unpredicted: lower acts are the same as heroism.
Mr. Anglend told the soldiers who were all trying to understood the prostitution of the Veneric disease to escape services on the front.
"The same Greek expression of this can be seen in the trade of honourable gender, which soldiers had been thrown up by genitals in hope of falling into hospital," he wrote.
"The deceived ones were insulted in the eyes of him, which often led to a living blindness."
Translated by the Swedish Peter Greeves by Mr. Anglond's guilty but nebraic, appropriate for his humanist task.
In the decades of small scenes, he shows how the war "befreed completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to ask why their leaders are forced to fight them.
The best books about the I World War often were indirect, such as "Great War and modern memory" Paul Fass, or Romans, such as "The Western front without change" Erika-Mary Remark, not with historical works.
Mr. Anglound's book is inside this insignificant pantheon.
His book has the most impliant end that I can remember in an inhuman literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he's been from the book up to the page with a peak person, he's cut it out of your hand and burned it with a bottle.
Following the previous error, a closely calculated raid
In the operation, hundreds of police officers were assigned, some of the protective staff.
The nights from Monday to Thursday have been selected because the Zukotti Park had to have less people at that time.
The operation was secret from everyone, except a few high-leaving officers, and the rest of the dream said they were going to learn.
The Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in the center of events, and his presence underlined how much the police department had added to operations.
It could not also be said of the repeating of these episodes in the last weeks, such as the use of over-gase gas against protestants, that was contrary to the rules of the Department, and the urgant of occupants.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, the police operation began to be released from the Protestant Zukotti Park.
The governments were prepared by watching the divergence of occupation in other cities.
The most important anticrisis studies were conducted on the island of Rendels with the Zukotta account.
The authorities increased the number of such trends in cases of disturbance, contra terrorism measures that provide rapid movement of a large number of police, namely under Manhattan.
After the training, it was held on Monday at the Manhattan side of East River.
The order to enter into the park came in "the last minute," said the source known to the offers that only were mentioned as "training".
"The few of the cops I know and who have been calling for this case did not say that they were sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke under the conditions of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest stations of the department."
One of the reasons of secretity was a lesson that took place in the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to purchase the park, but they declined before hundreds of protesters who were in front of the appointed time asking about these plans.
On Monday, the operation was involved in various police divisions, including the forces of the areas, the police team, which usually appeared in order to control crime areas.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like on, came and went out of the park during the day, which makes 1 hour of night a suitable time for dealing.
"I was really to do that when the park is less than all the people," he said.
The cars saved the service with prospectors and sound speakers, gathered on Pick-Slip and Franklin Rusvelt Drive, around the Manhattan Mountain before moving forward.
The manufacturer and previously recorded announcements from the speakers have feared many protesters.
When officials of administrative divisions entered into the park, many protesters simply collected their things and left.
The police reported that the palaces were not touched until 1:45 nights, giving the protesting time to collect things.
Other police groups, according to the testimony of observators, were gathered at the perimeter to enter in the case of arrests in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, representative of the Department of Police, said that it was done for their security.
But many journalists claim that they did not see how the police works, and that the police had been appealing to them.
Mr. Brown said that cars with television cameras on Church Street, along the west border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police passed west through the breast of different protesting things, including stones, plastics and polyetiles, full clothes, the healthy department teams followed it, collecting what was broke.
Some protesters who refused to get out of the country have shown it in the Internet.
The basic group of protesters took positions near the kitchen camp at the centre of the park.
There were barricades, and the police entered in, methodically arresting them.
Approximately 10 people in the Epi.
And two people were touched by the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
In order to cut the locks, they were called for salvation of services.
There were no arrests in the park at approximately 3:30 tomorrow, said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed in about 75 minutes, reported the police.
Mr. Brown said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for " the opposition of the public and the opposition of the detention," he said.
The highest officer was Joseph Esposito, the head of the Department and the officer's officer of the Department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the department's police, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, even though he was present, "He didn't run the operation," Mr. Brown said.
The second group of police were waiting for the east side of Broadway, between Liberti Street and Sidar Street, if necessary.
The constructions were placed on the Cortland Street, in the north quarter of the park, and on the Pine Street, in the south quarter.
Monitors saw that the police had expanded the perimeter from these places even beyond the Zokotti Park borders.
On one occasion, the observers saw that a group of police groups, with shoes, had kept people further.
Approximately 28 people were on the north perimeter.
The most serious events of the night have occurred to the south of the park.
About five to the south of Pine Street, one of the protesting prisoners was on the cover of the police car, and others, according to the apparents, released the air from the skin of the police car.
At a moment, the faner was flying out of there.
As a result, one of the police and one of the protestants were hospitalized.
The training of the service officer will be given to the city in court for freedom
The company, representing hundreds of school staff who lost places last month, plans to judge the city in the middle, claiming that freedoms were not and discriminatory because of non-proportional impact on schools where poor students learn.
The proceedings are probably the latest means available to the Profession of Circular Council 37 to try to cancel the release.
Seventy-two school assistants, the coordinator of parents and other employees who were among the most lowest payable employees in the town, lost their places on 7 October, as the leaders called a political reaction to refusing to give the city access to the medical funds managed by the slave groups to close the staff in the previous state budget.
The citizens rejected this accusation.
At hearings in the City Council last month, the school officer Dennis M. Walcott said that freedoms were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the members of the Parent Council said to him that there were no indications in the budget that the assistant staff would be released.
The representatives of the Circuit Council reported that they had been notified by warning the Department of Education that it had requested; a press conference will be held in the middle of the Middle Manhattan High Court to announce the formal request for the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
As responsibles, Mr. Walcott and the Department of Civil Education will be appointed and eight temporarily approved persons are renumbered as issues, all of them are black or latin American women, as well as most assistants, lose their places.
Elizabeth Thomas, representative of the Department of the City, said that the city has not seen seeking and therefore cannot comment on its specific positions.
In the preliminary version of the complaint held in New York Times, the promotion focused on a number of freedoms in the poor areas of the city to support the claim of injustice, acknowledging that poor schools have lost more assistance because they are chronicly unfinanced.
He indicates that while there was no release at State Island, and at the highest Side or Tribeki schools they had little, 17 inhabitants had lost schools in the 23th province of Brooklyn, B.C.E., and 46 had to go to surroundings 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Noteing the loss of five of eight school assistants, work in the Free Medium School 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students will be poverty, says: "This is not the areas of resident parents who can find money to fill the budget."
P.S. Budget was decreased by 3.26 per cent in this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate additional accounts for each poor participant who goes to school.
The Professional also claims that the director of school could be introduced in an error in the language of notice that allows the coordinators to be released with parents.
In the notification, the word "oversight" was reported, although the "overgrowing" is often described when a teacher of school is moved to a list of the names of the employees to be paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six co-ordinators were released with parents," says the Swedish request, "not simply translated."
Mission, Congress ready for the Libya Agreement
Responsibles and democrats at the Capitol Holm seem to be ready to agree on something that has a view to resurrect in Libya.
All that was needed is to succeed, the old Dictator Musamar Kaddafi was taken into fruit and killed, and the American interaction has been completed.
On Tuesday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate should consider the resolution made by President John Kerry (democracy, Masachusetts) together with the Senators of John's Cain (resident, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (unless of Connecutt), who praise the Lieutenant for the successful Resurrection and the American military for the "respect".
"The meaning of this resolution is to give respect to the courageous people of Libya when they begin to restore their country," Carrie said.
"This is the support of their democratic stress from both parties."
The language may appear to be invisible, but there was no easier discussion on Libya.
In this year, the legislators of both parties were interrupted with each other and with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the American Army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and Kein held a resolution allowing the use of American armed forces in Libya.
The draft legislation was opened by the Palestinian representatives of a significant majority of the votes of both parties and thus did not vote in Senate.
On the same day, however, when the draft legislation was passed in the Palace of representatives, the Palace also did not support a proposal that would cause the United States Operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some sort of purification law - when the Congress was sufficiently distracted to criticize the approach of Obama to the mission, but not so bad to actually cut the ground out of its feet.
The events then disrupted the insolvency of the Congress
In August, the Tripolis became library rebels, and on October 20, Caddafi was killed.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The Resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "respected by the people of Libya for its incredible courage and sustainability in the desire of freedom" and thanks to men and women of the United States armed forces and their coalition partners who were involved in the military operation for the protection of the Libyan people for their undeserved courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and unreverse transition to democracy in Libya".
Does new measures receive full support for the foreign Council, or will the legislators, as a june legislative project?
Contrary to the latest version, Senator Richard Mr. Luger, the leader of the Responsants in the Committee.
The representative of Luger said that he had not yet seen the last version of the legislative project.
On the other hand, the Court of Representatives of the Court of Justice must vote for the constitutional amendment required by the balanced budget, the main legal priority for each representative and for some democrats in the Congress.
This measures proposed by the Representatives of Bob Goodlat (resistance, Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else that will be made for the plenary vote of the Congress of this call.
Other legislators were not able to make their amendments to the plenary resource, but not because they did not try.
Gudla's amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that concern the broad range of issues that were in this call.
The same law was introduced to the Representative Palace and to the Senate, and others were insignificant expressions.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendments on the balanced budget only in the Palace of Representatives and more on "the control of federal expenditure".
They are also identical, but they give their authors, mainly the freshly-elected repositories, who want to improve their summary, the possibility to be surprised that they have "committed" such a proposal.
The Action on Budget Control, which passed in August, requested that the Council of Representatives and the Senate vote for the amendment to the balanced budget.
On March, 58 Senators voted for an unobligational resolution supporting the idea of such amendment.
Besides the budget, some congressmen want to make the number of terms of members of the Congress, and a member of the Representative of Hose Serrano (democracy, New York) wants to cancel the president's mandate for two times.
Congressman Jessie L. Jackson (democracy, Illinois) proposed amendments to guarantee, otherwise, the right to quality education and health protection.
The amendment that prohibits a single marriage has already been a long time, and another that prohibits flash burning.
Legislators also want to allow the abrogation of federal laws if two thirds of the states are opposed to them.
As the members of the Congress have tried to make amendments, they are moved faster than in the past years.
In the 111th convocation of the Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments and 66 in 110.
This temperature is compared to the beginning of the 1990s when the members of the Congress, according to the Senata, have been regulated by more than 150 amendments each two years.
But they were not more success than now.
After the amendment adopted, 27 was approved in 1992, but in the Congress it was actually in 1789.
"The killed, but not winned," says Gibfords in his first television interview after temptation
During ten months after the armed man shot it in the public business in Tusone, the member of the Representative of Gabriel Gibfords (democratic party, Arizona) on Monday evening, appeared on the federal channel, covered a melodie from the "Soul will return tomorrow" and said that he wanted more health than to return to the Congress.
By the 20/20 Aby-si News and Diana Soyer, Gibfords had the hard form of the proposal and needed help in the road.
The programme on its difficult way to restore after the traumatism, which was brought to the rubber, and cut the left side of the brain, and passed from front to back of the chair.
Three months later, she was unexpectedly returned to the Palace of representatives and triumphally discussed the legislative draft on the province.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, in which six and 13 people were killed, Gibfords had laughed, smiled and sang - and called his health "swak".
The 41-year Gibfords answered, "Very good."
Interview with Gibfords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was a part of the "20/20" special issue, which was shown to the outcome of the new book of husbands "Gabby: The story of courage and hope".
Specific reported the rehabilitation of Gibfords after shooting 8 January.
On the first few weeks of the video of Kelly, she lies on a hospital cock with a bridge and a long scream on the rubber.
She can only lift up one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Gibfords sits in the box, and the physiotherapeutes teach her how to perform simple actions.
Smoothing.
Get out of the mouths.
And then her first word, "What."
After a few days, Gifffords said the second word, "tost", requested to change the menu in the morning.
The video shown by A-Bi-si demonstrates that she played a central role in the healing of Gibfords: we see how the congressman can sing with the doctors "The girls just want to enjoy" Cyndi Loper and "Free Pause" Tom Petty.
In the interview of Soyer Gibfords, who's trading for two hours a day, said he's not remembering the day of temptation.
Her husband told him that he had read the article of Gibfords in the 12 March's shooting journal when she stopped him to ask for the six killed then.
The suspicious attacker, Jared Lee Lafner, is in Missouri and is subject to a strong treatment in the expectation of the court.
"Man people have died," said Gibfords Soyer.
"Watch, hard, hard."
Once during her health, Cally Saoer said, "I'm over."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not survived," said Kelly.
You're just killed.
And you're going through it, you're healthy, and you're going back more than ever.
Armies feel more grief than respect
The business was a holiday at Wall Street, who collected millions of dollars for homeless veteran in New York.
Kid Rock slept a ballade of unhelp, disappointment, and loss.
According to the signal, a few hundred soldiers, mariners, aircrafts and mariners were built around him.
The auditorium in the smoking aplode is standing for him.
"On military servants looked like the heroes," said David Zaltzman, who organized a pleasant collection of money.
The former military officer on the concert, on which the current president of the Chairpersons Committee, was admired by Mike Mallen, had a different role in the military.
"They were walking like the poor," wrote the officer in the electronic letter.
I'm sure the organizers wanted as well.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect.
The opposite impressions are fully illustrated by the weaknesses between the army and the often equilibrium, sometimes aggressive American pigs.
The soldiers thanked for their victims.
But praises have their price, they say military servants.
The P's more is like it's like a trial to people in the form.
"We are not all victims," said Brigadian General Shawn B. Farland, who commanded military armies in Iraq and goes to Afghanistan.
"But, the only way for some to show support is to handle us as unfortunate."
It is a sensitive subject for military leaders who do not want to look to be ungrateful or ungrateful with the society they serve.
They also realize that the wrath of the army returned in the last years of war in Vietnam was farer.
As a result, the majority of the complaints are quiet and only between the fighting veterans.
After the two of his sons returned from the fighting in the sea coast, the Colonel in Mark Kenschn was warned them that none of the army would look at their service from two points of view.
They will be looking at them with excitement because they have wounded the refugees and were in exotic places.
Others will think if it is not hidden "under the mask's wrath of evil veteran," said Kenschn, who was fighting in Iraq and returned to take a high government post in Washington.
As long as he was looking for, he felt that some interviewers were asked whether he would be able to keep the pressure of the responsible work in Washington after the fighting.
Kenschn recalls how he said to his sons, "When you tell about your service, you must consider negative effects."
The disturbance of the military is partly happening from the American insufficiency to wars.
Congratulations in the field of war are rarely obtained from a country who is a little familiar with the army and sees a little direct benefit from war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, have no longer appreciated military heroism as it was usually in the Second World War," says the General Lieutenant in the department of David Bernow, who commanded American armies in Afghanistan.
Instead of this, the highlighting of policies and p's focus is mainly on the depth of military service suffering.
The military evaluates the number of income they have made, by the number of companions they have lost, or by the extent of loss.
The Army has increased pressure by the parties to combat violence
This week on historical auditions should be decided whether 28 men and women would be taken against the army of accusation against violence.
If not, hundreds of issues will be made in order to make it.
The first class of Elizabeth Layman was violated by her servant at night for 25 years and on 11 weeks of detention.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her catarr at the Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner, and met a couple of men who had no 12 bird bottles.
He asked if he could come to her to drink.
"This was a red flag," says Lyman.
But Texas' birth has rejected his dangers.
I thought no, he was 19 years old.
"He is from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instinct."
Some minutes after they entered the Layman Commander, the man came back to her, fell and violated, confirmed it.
This week, on 18 November, Layman and 27 of the current and 27 military servants will be stressed to wait for the decision of the court on historical hearing, which was held in Arlington, Virginia, and which would decide whether they had taken a decision against the former Minister of Defence of Robert Gates and his former Donald Rasmfeld.
Gates and Ramsfield have not been able to cope with the broadly spread violence in the army against the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Isc, given in February by Susan Berk from Washington, D.C., was initially included 17 inhibitors, but the army was growing up to 28 for months, 25 women and three men who all claim that they were undermined by violence or threat of sexual violence by the servants and that the army did not necessarily investigate, did not pursue the legal order or did not ensure the appropriate justice after the proposed attacks.
Berk says she was insulted on the highest armies, because the problem begins with them.
"The Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are those who can destroy the cold of violence?"
Berk also states that from February there were some 400 other victims, many of whom could participate in future searches.
She: Rather than collecting all the eggs in this matter, it will open a lot of things if it needs to support pressure.
The Defence Minister of the Defence Command under the lead of the Federal Prosecutor of Nila Braid took steps to stop the matter.
The newsweek court documents reveal the protection, in particular that former or current soldiers cannot submit an offence to the army of harmful forces.
The Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by military service by the High Court of Justice of 1950.
"The proposed damage is to the risk of the military service of stakeholders," states the documents.
The Defence Minister refused to comment this story.
The situation has changed since the 50s.
Although women have been officially prohibited to participate in the fight, this division is only in words: modern wars often have a clear front line.
And in Iraq and in Afghanistan, women's military team plays a more important role, especially in contacts with women in combat areas.
Results: In the period between two wars, 150 soldiers died - two thirds of them in the fight.
The Armies are also in time to become modern, says Berk.
She is not alone in its fight; in addition to her request, three other are ready.
In the Yeal Jurid, the Seminar jury of the Veterinary Service is prepared against four major military academies in the promotion of the genocide atmosphere.
The non-Community of the American Weather War in Vietnam prepares a search against the army, in which the diagnosis of the " change of persons" is the victims of violence to remove them from the service, a common manifestation of the activists such as Anna Bhagvati from the right-guarding group of women's military servants.
In December, her group asked the Veterinary Affairs Office by accusing him of discrimination to consider pensions from people who claimed that sexual violence had been threatened during the service.
Nine separate legislative projects, which have a number of measures, were held in the Congress by the Group of Senators and members of the Palace of representatives from both parties.
In 2010, by warning and combating the sexual violence of the Ministry of Traffic, 3/158 trials were reported.
But it is likely that the attacks are often not reported, and, according to Pentagon's own evaluations, this number consists of approximately 13.5 per cent of the 19.000 cases that occurred in that year.
This report also examines the percentage of the cases in March: In 2010, 20 per cent of cases were reached to the court – two times less than in the civil justice system.
The island in Berk's case calls the attacks on them only as the first in a number of other traumatisms.
In the case of Lyman, she stated that the violence in the military field was less than a hour after it had happened.
On that night, she said, she asked her to tell the detail of violence about 11 times the police officer, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of violation, and the blood of the attacker - from the hand - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Layman was sitting before the judges to listen, where she was asked whether she had sex with her friend before the day of the attack.
Six people had a local characteristic of the accused one who was finally justified.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was rose now, I was running out of the court room with a cry."
"They put me into a psychiatrist, and when I went out, I remember that my commander said, "This wasn't a judge over him, it was a judgment against me."
Layman was invited to refer to the military psychiatrist, which finally has the diagnosis of the change of the person that made it unfair to the service.
In January 2010, she was disappointed with an unfair formula that did not allow her to receive any benefits.
Whether the case that Lyman and her companions have been taken on request is a complicated question, says John Terley, professor of the right to the University of George Washington.
But he notes, "I think they are able to move forward."
It's the tree that criticizes from the pounds as it appeared.
I've criticized Dr. Fress all my life.
The Army remained for decades because it has no incentives and retaining funds that are responsible.
He adds, "The chances are greatly contrary to them... but it is important for them to try."
These things will be changed only when ordinary people will take place.
If listening does not benefit them, Berk, the island, will have hundreds of other issues for future matters.
"We will continue to fight the army on this matter until there is a reform," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happened before.
The wall has eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before being a new person of the right extremism in the Property, Anders Bering Briwick was a common man who expressed his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Brivic, a mass murder in Norway in July, which led 77 persons to life, appeared to his first open audience.
Although Brivic could be able to set up on the same side, he had not been a lot of time in the network: he had been preparing for an attack on his computer and communicating with millions of nationalists who support the right groups in the networks.
After a yearly tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how can you find them?
Let's just go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was very unfortunate for them," says Jamie Bartlett, the author of the recent report on the Peace Cyber Populism of the British Research Centre of DEMOS.
The reserve of personal data on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett that researchers can easily use the reklame tool of the website to determine a demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketetologists and have been doing a few years ago.
The Bartlett command found half million fans of right groups throughout the whole group and then submitted the advertisement to them, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the advertising of the user to question the levels of their education, violence and optimism of their own future.
With Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 100,000 participants were able to ask 14 extreme rights partys in 11 Pays - not even out of the Office.
"This is a perfect new way to investigate," says Bartlett.
The results are not so vulnerable: the online sites of right groups are most often young men of the sex, the failure of immigration.
But unexpectedly, "they who associate their online activity with offline activity are more democratic and less aggressive than those who are just hidden behind the monitor."
The DEMOS work is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new population in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and politicians use the website to study all in the light - from the issues of health to the trends expressed in Laika, the stages on the wall and the status updates.
With more than 800 million active users added in the average of three records per day, "superactive information" Facebook calls for the study of the paper by increaseing the number of scientific articles called the site in the heading 800 per cent in the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook is the possibility of studying people who are not able to reach the street with a block.
"Before, if you want to ask people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You should enter the party and they would never accept you," says Bartlett.
"Facebook excludes all of this -- you're referring to them."
Others say that this site could be found and investigated in health problems.
The last study of Dr. Megan Moreno from Wisconsin University, Madison, and her colleague showed that students who discussed their drinking approaches on Facebook were significantly higher than students who were silent in this way.
Moreno assumes that students, for example, their teachers in society, could monitor and interfere with the website to help a student who is too often updated by drinking statuss.
"You can't resolve the problem without finding it," reported Washington Post Dimitri Christkis, co-operator Moreno and Director of the Centre of Health, Behavior and Development in the Children's Scientific Research Institute.
"We found a way to discover children from a group of risks that would not be found otherwise."
Facebook also continues to produce a variety of data about its users.
The data group of the website on the statistics of the status and day of the Holy Valentine, the middle of 2010 electors and the National Happiness Index (in the main way, using information that only has access to them, the Cyber Freedom Champions long-term stated that the site should make its extensive data collection available for the investigation).
But Facebook users know that the website is watching them, they like it or not - in exchange for the possibility of playing in Scrabble with another one in thousands of miles from you, the website can handle your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of the investigation they don't even know?
While researchers have strictly certain standards for remote investigations, online data are generally available.
"I don't think that many users would at least think that research could be observed by their profiles," says Neil Selvin, sociologist from the London knowledge Laboratory, on the investigation that he had conducted in 2006 with the use of the general accessible students in Facebook.
"It was just between them and their friends."
Then there's a question of methodology.
Even offline does not guarantee that the investigation object is permanently honest.
Facebook does not find out the number of information in the profile and pages of the user is true.
"What you're talking on Facebook and what you're doing in Facebook's terms, it's two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
This is why, despite the years of its technology research, Selvin believes that the block and the hands are still the best studies of the tools that can be used.
"Nothing can be replaced by the outcome of real peace and communicating with real people," he says.
"The investigations are expected to be regarded by the age, and most of them are still going to be offline."
"Culd and foolish": Anders Bering Briwick will first be publicly presented before the court
Anders Bering Brivic, a person who recognized a dual attack organized 77 persons in Norway this year, described himself as a fighter of "opposition" during the first public event in the court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Motion of Opposition and Ricarai Tamplier's Norway," he stated before 500 in the court room.
"I express the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hatred idealology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the actions, but I don't recognize the fault."
Judge Thorkyel Neshaim interrupted Bridge during this monarch, 'for he didn't want to give Bravic the opportunity and to use this hearing as a plate for expressing his own views.'
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravic, who brought him the first written text, to return to the family of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Neshaim also commanded the police to keep Brivic under 12 more weeks, prohibited access to the MI for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take all visits and transfers to eight weeks under stretch control.
About 30 survivors and victims have visited listening.
They hoped to see Brivic in the eyes, and others were to make sure that he was locked.
All have come to find answers to their questions.
"I am that he looks cold and unclean," told the Norwegian channel of the NRK one of the survivors at Utoy.
"It was uncomfortable, but I personally became a little more likely after I saw and heard the suspect."
Bravic's dressed in dark coast and blue gate holded peace and professionalism during all hearings and looked at journalists and survivors when he entered and out of the construction.
Despite the strange idea of Brivic being part of the great "opposition" movement, the judge claimed that he was not foolish, and said that there was no evidence of what he had done with the partners.
Some may be satisfied that the attacks of 22 July seem to be an extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this doesn't decrease automatically the worm and the mixture that all the nations feel now.
"I would like him to look like a monster, but it's not true," said the family of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it would be."
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, which are in the theater this week
After Stephen Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing a technical gene as the Great Isobreator of modernism.
But what Apple fans can be considered as the greatest open -- in the recently discovered interview that had been mentioned in the preliminary port of the main markets this week, it was how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a mentor, and he was a hyppy, but he was also an adequate organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business operators suffered from "the pains to think that the actually great idea of 90 per cent of work... [but] a great idea of the great product is a great quantity of experienced work."
Go back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Triumf Ners television on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more hours with Jobs in a unique long-term negotiation.
At that time, about 10 years since Jobs was released from Apple, and he had already worked in his new NeXT computer company in waiting for a mass accommodation of the Internet.
While a small part of the Kringley interview was used in Nerdah, he says that original interviews about transportation.
Only after Jobs' death, the full VHS copy was found in the register garage.
This slight material, a little ranged, is based on the 68-minute film of Steve Jobs: the Territory Interview that comes to Landmark Theaters in this environment and Thursday.
For a man who hates his detailed interview, Jobs is unusually ready to express his technical philosophy and business strategy.
And it's an incredible idea.
In four different moments during the interview, there are large intervals between issues and answers -- thinking for 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly highlights his thoughts to say more accurately.
Moreover, there are moments where Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface where he is the issues of Kringley, which make it quickly to go to issues or events of greater importance.
The Potterian interview has something bad prophecy before Pixar's era when Jobs evaluates what different companies do true and wrong, and makes their own vision of future instruction technologies.
One thing is to read about Jobs' evaluations, but there is something vulnerable and inspiring in Jobs, which we see here, an anxious pointer on the road.
He has a vision of what things could be and should be.
In the way after he said everything here, he went and did it.
Small comment on the seven significant conclusions of the Potterial Interview:
How he learned to handle business:
"Why are you doing this?" And the answers that you're unchangedly receiving, "Oh, that's just what you do."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks about business very deeply.
That's what I've learned.
Jobs continues to detailedly describe its efforts to rationalise the reporting in Apple.
The disrupted way of recording costs, often started by "standard costs" which were taken from the river and then undertaken by "depreciation", created a auto-designed structure that guarantees that they would be able to follow business costs to small.
About Daddy's shot:
Jobs tells detailedly about the blue box, which he mastered with Steve Voznack, a device that allowed people to effectively broke up the phone company and call a large distance free.
Many of the devices were written before, but the afory of Jobs here, when described the blue box as an infectionate actor.
He explains how he and Boznak tested the box using the phone-automates, ordering and then subcontracting from one AT&T network to another until they were acquired of more employment.
"We took the earthquake of a half-hour once, and you cried to the phone-auto, and it was a minute later in the neighbor's phone-auto," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we have taken is that we could make something that could control the billion dollars of infrastructure throughout the world."
We both knew a little, but we could have mastered a little thing that could control the big thing-- it was a wonderful lesson, and I don't think that without that, Apple could ever appear.
Jobs continues to detail the detailed outcome he and Voznak practically performed by calling to Vatican through the blue box in the midnight and requesting Papa's phone, trying to copy Henry Kisinger.
When the different catholic members were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, these two were dismissed immediately before the Pope was raised to answer on the phone.
About the intimacy of the technology (and the cold call for Bill Hulet):
At the age of 12 years, he found Bill Hulet at the phone composer and called him.
In the course of their 20-minute phone Jobs received an aeroplane in Hulet Pacard.
"This showed me a strong impact, it was the only company I saw in that age, and it formed my view of what it is and how well they are relating to their responsibilities."
Jobs later is one of the HP, visits the Company's laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the only first board computer".
He was the size of the chemode, he had a small monitor with a electron-beautiful tube, and I loved it.
I often spent in HP with growth and switched around the car and wrote a program for it.
About improvised innovation:
In several places, the interview of Jobs is talking about the exhibition of new products for aeroplane.
At his career's time when he went to sell the pool of mountings, one purchased him to collect a whole computer.
Only 30 days in credit, he was supposed to think about the collection and supply of prepared devices.
Later in Apple he mentioned the difficulties he faced by working a computer mouse:
"I remember the wraths... they cried on me that it would take five years [to collect the mouse that would cost $300], and I was sitting on the hair, and I went out and found the designer."
Nine hundred days later we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was unbelievable.
About large companies that lose energy:
Before he raised Apple's birth, Jobs intended exactly how many leaders of adults were wrong in seeing the situation and lost the control of the market.
"You're working in IBM or Xerox, so you're doing the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopolie on the market, so the company doesn't become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [this are the types of people] who are finally guided by companies, and those who make product are exhausted from the decision-making area.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolist position is disturbed by people who have no understanding of the difference between good and bad products, the needed art.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take the whole industry of instruction technologies.
He could be ten times more, maybe Michaeloft 90...
They got a hurt from the winner.
Innovation as a form of experience:
"The great idea of a big product has a great quantity of experienced work... when you discover a great idea, it changes and will."
You'll know a lot of her tonches.
There are compromises that you need to go -- some things you can't make electronics, glasses, robots or bags.
You need to keep 5,000 Idians -- these concepts, together with them all together...
At the end of the account, it's all going to do with the best thing that people have ever produced, and later it's trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picaso said the good artists are copying, the big artists are wounding.
We've always been worried about giving great ideas.
The part of what has been done to Macintosh was that people who worked on it were the poetants, artists, zoologists, historicals who had become the best specialists in the field of incapacity technologies worldwide.
If they weren't immune technology, they would have done things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are disputed with the opposers of the health protection law until the court examines the matter
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered for the closed doors to discuss a political question, he would listen to the derogation of President Obama's health law, two of his judges, Antonina Scalalia and Clarence Tomas, who were in the midst of both sponsored courts, who would take the case before the High Court.
This case occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petition issued.
One of the issues of the agenda was a roadcast supported by 26 States, which promoted a streaming health review adopted by the Congress last year, the law which united the conservative activists of all the nations.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the reverse delays are expected in March 2012 at 5 1/2 hours, and the result will become a mistake in the presidential round, which will be in the most deteriorated until the decision was approved.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law on health protection should be canceled, mostly, will be Paul Clement, who was a representative of the general prosecutor during the presidentship of George W. Bush.
The Clement's legal company, Bancroft PitéC, was one of the nearly two decades of a company who had helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federals Community, a long time a group who continued to discharge conservative legislation principles.
Another company, sponsor of dinner, represents one of the trade associations that has undertaken the law, the National Feder of independent business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical gygant Pflizer Inc, which has a great financial interest in difficulty.
The dinner was held at Washington hotel a few hours later after the meeting of the court on the matter.
It was, among others, Mitch ́ Connel, the leader of the Responsants in Senate and the opposite of the health law.
Initial guests on both?
Nothing new: two judges have visited the Federal Community for many years.
And it's not going to be contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free of the Code of conduct which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were subjected, they might be under the Code principle 4C, which claims: "The Court may visit the activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a reporter, a member of the host or a mention in the programme of such activities."
However, the evidence of Scalia and Thomas close to two legal firms in this case, as well as to the company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethical activists in the Government.
"It is an exciting ecological violation and the independence to the code against the statements of certain judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Action.
"The courts have been drinking and eating at an official action on the collection of money with the cases which are now considered in the court."
Their statements of independence and participation in the collection of money for this business are supported and is inappropriate.
Scalia and Thomas are focusing on critics who say that they are totally mixing the cases of the court with the groups of the Federal Communities.
And the wife of Thomas, Jenny, is a conserver activist.
Moreover, the conservators claim that this is a ethical issue against the judge of Elena Cagan, not a Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main court of the service of Obama administration when the first judgment against law was given at the court of the first institution.
Her critics were required to take Kagan away from listening to this matter because she was too able to protect the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan doesn't think she's going to do that.
Boeing receives a recorded 18 billion aircraft order
Aeroplane Emirates orders 50 broadcasts Boeing 777 and may be 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, share size - more than 1 billion dollars.
Whether it's the news that the company receives order for 50 units of its production.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co Airporter, and the pre-scale price for all these 50 aircrafts is 18 billion dollars.
The same is important where Boeing received a command: Middle East, which allows the gold living in future orders on the plane.
The Chicago company recalls that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft values in 450 billion.
Boeing announcement in these outputs is the greatest in the dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 two-passed Boeing 777 aircrafts.
The incredible order was made by the Emirates Air Company in Dubai.
The aircraft also has the opportunity to buy more 20 aircrafts that will raise the total price of $26 billion, stated Boeing at Aviaisou Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing, Oman Air reported for six Boeing 787-8s, such as Dreamliner, which can be a significantly better fuel economy and enjoyable for passengers.
The preliminary price for six aircraft is more than 1 billion dollars.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said the Morningstar Nil Dior's analysis.
"The quality of these specific buyers is sufficiently high."
Many near-east aircrafts possess petroleum countries.
Therefore, they have not only money to pay for the aircraft but also the increase in fuel prices that are usually injury to aircraft companies, since it is one of the largest cost articles that are not so losing, because the country is making money on high prices for oil.
It is important, since they with less probability than other aircraft companies will cancel the aircraft order when prices grow, said Dior.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership on the broad-foulous aircraft market and helps not to allow Airbus SAS partner's attempt to reach his master with his A350 airline.
The conviction of Boeing on the airport occurred four months after Airbus stated that he would devote the greatest A350, which was covered by 777-300ER.
He refused the debt to increase the charge of assets after the purchasers needed to increase the carriage and the distance of the air.
Boeing Co actions increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of President Me'aki obviously lost elections in Michoacan
Louisa Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped the opposer Fausto Valecho from the IRP in a pre-elective rock.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon, who did not refer to his request to the place of the Governor of Michoakan during the hostile state elections, stated on Monday that the drugs were helped to deal with one of its opposers.
The preliminary results of the leader of the west Governor are called Fausto Valecho from the Institution-Revolution Party, or IRP.
"Intervention of the organized crime during the entire election process and particularly yesterday, not only for Michoakan but also for the whole country," said Louise Maria Calderon in the radio interview on the day after the resurrected vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electors at elections... they took a time to vote, imposed obstacles... and imposed people to vote" for the IRP.
The IRP has been managed by Me's seven decades until the presidency was lost in 2000.
She's preparing a return, and the victory of Michoacan is an important step in this trial.
The IRP hopes to win presidential elections in July.
Valecho, just a bit of calderon, who was heading the rating before the election day.
Calderon, candidate from the National Action Party, or PND, appointed by her brother, from accepting Valecho a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, candidate from the Left Democracy of the Revolution Party, or DPR, who now belongs to the Governing Class, has come to the third serious damage for divided and insufficient left before the presidential elections of 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the results.
Valecho, the former officer of the state of Morel, refused to join drug traffickers and invited other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacan, drug careers specialized on marihuana, heroine and metaphetamine.
This is the country of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch military oper against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence has continued to be done.
Mayer from the PND was killed in week before elections when he acted for Louise Calderon, and several candidates were out of a pre-elected trick because of fear.
For the IRP, however, as a worst looking for elections in Michoacan, the victory will give a movement impulse of the party.
A man who had to represent the IRP in the presidential round, Enrike Pen Neito, speaking from Washington, welcomed Valecho and said, "I think that this victory must be very awesome at the front of the year."
ABR convinces Asia to help save the zone
The Asian Development Bank committed India and China to be ready to help save the zone from the Peace crisis to avoid a long-term fall that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Radan Nag, manager of the ABR office in Manile, said that two most rapidly developing economys should " do whatever they can" in order to restore a monetary block by means of the International Value Fund or the first bilateral agreements.
He warned that BRIK countries are looking at the difficulties of the "forestry" and said that the Asian financial stage on the side of Peace leadership and resources could help to escape a long-term fall in the global economy.
"We're all doing this."
"This is why anybody who can help to get out of the crisis is useful," he reported the Financial Times interview during the World Economic Force in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected at some point, but it can't be inevitable."
"So if China and India can help, it must be necessary."
• The monetary union has been extremely distorted by the Peace debt crisis in the past months.
In recent days, Italia's business funds have grown threatening, and the Prime Ministers and Italy and Greece have been delayed.
The long-term crisis has been threatened that it can bring the world economy to the recession again, and has led to the invitations of leading developments to gather together in order to help the area to find a decision.
Mr. Neg foretold that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the MVF, but said that bilateral cooperation — such as purchasing the EU financial assistance funds, means to ensure financial stability -- provides great strength in the negotiations of Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce in India, said that "India will do whatever it can" to help the zone, since its own economy is now concerned with the reduction of exports and the reduction of the influences of foreign capitals.
"No one wants the zone to remain instable and insane," he said.
"We have great tasks, and we must support the high level of growth."
"This is not an alternative, it's a commitment, because we'll find for tens of millions of ours and girls."
Others claim that the economic development of India does not have any meaning to help rich men when they are in their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Warshney, Professor of the Braun University in the United States, said that it would be very complicated with a political view to provide assistance for billion Indians, of whom approximately 800 million will be $2 per day or less.
"In a moment they will learn that the Greeks are going to pension for 50 years and go to the festivals to the sea, and that will not be taken well," he said.
Le Hovell, manager of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why the reserves of India should be used to contain the Greek multi- and well-payed public sector's multiplayers in the wrong-organized, emergency undertakings such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the crisis of the zone threatened the "significant consequences" throughout Asia.
The ABR ' s 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now occurred with " lower risks" because of a threat.
He said that vulnerable developing markets need to make "great plans" to protect themselves from the fall and significant degrees of capital from their economy.
Pentagon's terrible warnings on potential reductions of defence costs
The Defence Minister Leon Panetta has called on the situation on Monday at the assembly by warning that the expected automatic reductions of the budget would be a national security and would call for a financial rate reaction from the Pentagon Corridors to the fields of combat in Afghanistan at the line and to the civil assembly.
Pentagon is already used to reduce $450 billion in the next decade, but now it is afraid that you add the reductions to 600 billion or more may be unsecure if the conference cannot reach the cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be disruptive for the Ministry," Panett wrote to the Senators of Resistance to John Cain, Arizon, and the Resistance of Lindsey Greham, South Carolina.
He said that the insufficiency of the assembly to adopt a budget agreement and that resulted in such a segree will initiate a total reduction of 23 per cent and a break of many new projects.
"This strong reduction, which is so unrepentantly applied, will make most of our projects on shipships and building uncomplete -- you can not buy three quarters of ships or ships -- and cause a serious damage to other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to Senators.
"We should also have to allow many of our state officers and, since the reduction will be made so quickly, we must almost allow States to achieve objectives."
"These changes will cause the confidence of those who support the Army and cause serious threats to combat."
The reductions at the end of the account will be cut off the military parts, said Panet.
"When military operations in Saving emergency operations have not been inclined by the sequever, military achievements are seriously suffering from serious disturbance in the main budgets," advertised Panet.
"The Contracting Staff will be reduced to conclude the cancellation of contracts and the supervisory agreement which supports the military."
"The State staff will be reduced, leading to late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be imposed."
Two Senators wrote the Panette 10 days ago, requesting details of the consequences of automatic reductions in the Defence Ministry.
"The consequence of September in the Defence Ministerial will become a rapid fall of the United States as a leader of the world military state."
"We are firmly opposed to these dracon actions," reported the Senators in the joint statement on Monday evening when they were found in the Panetty's letter.
"This is not the outcome we can live with, and this is not the outcome we have to join ourselves."
"Sexvector is a threat to the interests of the United States' security, and this is to allow it to happen."
Whether the letter of Panetes or the last warnings of Senators to the budgetary compromise will be made or will enhance the calls for the release of Pentagon from the reductions that will be seen later.
Panetta was absolutely honest about the reductions, although he came to the Pentagon leadership after many years of the budgetary expertise in Congress and White House and realized that he was able to take into account the wrong choice.
At the press conference last week, the Defense Minister has drawn a devastated picture of what could follow - an army with a cloud, but without a nuclear.
"This is a ship without mariners."
"This is a set of no pull."
"It's an aircraft without enough pilots."
"This is the paper tiger, the army with catarrms, ships and bombs without sufficiently prepared soldiers who are able to perform the mission," Panetta said in its introductive comments in Pentagon.
"This is the power that suffers from an insatisfactory fighting spirit, the bad preparation and the failure of fighting potential deficiencies."
"In fact, it promotes aggression."
In the application of their letters to Cain and Graham Panett, new details showed how reductions are "building the meaning of operational risks: reactions to crisis, conflicts and disasters; seriously they are able to be the first in spread and reaction worldwide; and lead to unacceptable risks in future fighting operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could be able to cope with prejudices, including those who have already been tested, and some at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 struggle, planned by a new bombarder, a balistic subcutaneous ship of new generation, a new fighting ship of the border zone and a new earthly fighting vehicle that the Army and the Sea Peak need to replace the hamer.
The end of the next time and testing of F35 can scan 80 billion dollars for 10 years, but its partners say that it is a vital step to comply and resist the potential threats of China and other opposers.
How to lying
The current view of the last titles shows the serious and global disappointment and lies in the daily life.
The chairman of the Herman Cain's chairmans has been committed by the accusation of sexual households of several women; each party is accused of lying.
The Pen-Bani University Administration has been accused of false witnessing, since they likely have hidden that a football trainer had violated the boys.
Last week, President of France Nicholas Sarcosi was captured when he spoke to the President Baraku Obama at the assembled microphone that the Prime Minister of Israel was Benjamin Netanyahu lyer.
The liar spreads the career and covers the country.
The Congressman of New York and the Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weiner, you are a fool, refusing your outcome that was quickly carried out by unrespectable evidence.
The former candidate at President John Edwards was pronounced a claim in financial mistake during the campaign with non-governmental relations.
And again, no one of those who lived at that time will forget the media cycle with President Bill Clinton, who was lying about his sexual relations with Monica Levinski during his second time of post.
The story of the school and coldge tests is a common case.
There were cases when the teacher gave the disciples answers to the tests to have a good result of their activities.
Teachers who have to teach the opposite have sent a message that lies and mockeries are accepted.
With what number of lies are we stumbled?
During one day, as studies have been studied, you can lie from 10 to 200 times.
Now it is supposed that a significant part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that strangers were lying three times in the first 10 minutes.
Declaration of lies or injury is necessary for every skill, both for different and professional goals.
In contrast with the commat game, as it is said, the shadows where it is to be called "Peace!", the declaration of a lie is a serious direction of knowledge, which is based on scientific data collected in the recent six decades of the pressing universities, works with universal research projects, especially on psychology and physology.
One of the results of the study is that the majority of old mins of lies were divorced.
The liars look in the eyes.
They're not always hunting, hurt, red, or swimming.
It should not be concluded that false people are difficult to note and difficult to disappoint.
A experienced lying divorce can reach the truth, watching the structure of ambitions, mimics, issues structures and temporary characteristics.
I have spent several years by studying scientific openings in a broad and continuous section of the knowledge of lies, and clearly that the discovery of falsehood is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to orientate in our complex world - especially if your professionals include recruitment, meetings, negotiations or management.
Good liars are excitingly able to read others by providing them to feel unnecessary, governing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others appreciate them.
We know from the investigation that the experts are more than the introverts that men lie more about themselves, while women -- others -- usually to protect some feelings that married people are less than unmarried (but the lie they say, most often.)
We also know that if you are a liar, others will feel less guilty of you.
How do you understand if someone lies?
First, watch the normal behavior of your object.
It is called "the definition of the origin status".
This helps to provide a point of sending for changes.
Watch the street, the smile, the voice characteristics of your object.
You would well know whether a person keeps swinging the feet in the normal condition, then you don't blame wrong accusations when you'll see the foot in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for a group of false religious and unbelievable acts.
Remember these groups as the red flags, not the evidence of the illness.
The wallets may fix the part of their body when they are trying to remember their history, they can put their steps in the direction of the door, move out, change their position in certain ways, or demonstrate "easy after interview" -- this excessive breath of facility and change of poes when all complex issues behind.
The surveys often fascinate the application signal to simply look at this facility after interview.
See the point of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson has arrived and exposed the past time, acknowledging that his murdered wife is alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
Private people may also use distantization in saying, "I had no sex with this woman... Miss Levinski" or to repeat the complicated question.
The most typical religion of food indicators are captured.
Someone can use the "kwal" language when he answers the complex question: "Hor ́o ́ho ́o ́o ́o ́s truth , as I know . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This makes a response more emotional than real, and often is a red flag.
There is no means to discover lies, but it is possible to be able to be able to find a lie.
These skills will increase the opportunities for each to not be a victim of experienced juices in professional and personal life.
The negative plan for the building of oil needs to be reexamined after the threat of the United States to reject its approval
A few days after the Omama administration has threatened to reject the approval of the planned petroleum from Canada to Me Mexico Valley, he has called anger on the propaganda, but he has paid the environmental protectors -- a company that is going to build petroleum, claims that it will fully revise the project to restore it.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would have a planned oil from the environmentally sensitive area of Pesce Holmes in Nebraska and is sure that the project would still be approved.
The company took this decision on the press conference in the Nebraska capital.
The Official Representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas says that the company is confident that it will finally receive an approval for oil, although with another route.
This happens after the statement of the State Department last week, that he will make a decision on the project at the federal level until he will study new `roads that are not concerned with the Nebraska Mountains' region and the Ogala, a great subterraneous water stock.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Le Terry, a repository from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise, commanded by the State Department, will, mostly, refuse to take decisions before 2013, after elections in the year, although the authorities refused that the policy had been interrupted in this decision.
Both in the written statement for the last week called a decision by the State Department, and expressed support to him.
Petroleum of 1,700 miles should be spent from Canada to Me Canadian village.
He must transfer 700,000 barrelas on the day from Albert's province to petroleums in Texas.
In order to deal with this, he needs to cross six states.
He hates environmental protectors, but they love professionals that hope about 200,000 slaves with oil.
However, the Nebraska legislators standing against the plan consider the legislative project to enable the movement from the Pesce Halls and the Acquifer of Ogalala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current investigation of the State Department on Environmental Effects showed that the project would only have a negative impact on the environment, but the source of energy has stated that the Department's review has proposed an expertise of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is the lobbyist of TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was adviser in the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, conflict of interests for the programme.
Another was the choice of a company that was taken to conduct an initial investigation that was inadequate, since it was held with TransCanada.
Patty Label was sent to court because she was as if she had called a child tough from fear.
The family from New York states that Patty LaBell's divorce was started to be able to stumble in their homes at Manhattan, in fear of their little daughter until the degree that was in fear.
Lady Marmalade's executive Tirada feared the 18-month Geneva Monk so much that she had transferred "the change of persons, the disturbance of sleep" and "the fear of strangers," says her family in the High Court of Manhattan.
This occurred on 10 November of the past year when Kevin Monk, his wife, the teacher of the garden, Rosanna and Geneva were going to travel in a family travel.
Until Kevin Monk took a car, Rosanna Monk came down to the bulvary of Riverside with their baggage, which was Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down for a minute.
"Nobody came back to me and said, "You know what your daughter does?" I said, "yes" and I went to take her," she said.
LaBell hardly made a claim for a female.
"He aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosan Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care about what you're talking or thinking."
She came into anger and started to use anger -- the word on C and the word on F -- on the higher tons...
She had water bottles, and she started to throw water out of the bottle on me.
She said Geneva's started an insult.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did with my daughter," said the baby's mother.
Label was thrown on the mother -- which still holded Geneva -- and her companions had to hold her and shut her in the expecting car, said Rosan Monk.
The little girl weeped so much that she was stuck, and she added.
Label later sent a record with excuses but did not receive an answer.
Label's lawyer and representatives are not responsible for commentary calls.
The amount of compensation is not reported, but the family, C日 Davis, said that it was taken freely for this and that the family planned to carry out any money that would receive, for the well-being of the disease cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty Label answer for his actions," said David.
"This behavior is completely unfair, especially by the student of the garden with a 18-month child in hands."
Climate problems have caused the economy
During the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes in Sinaloa, the labour market was grown without and the illegal work market was reduced and the economy was weak.
The year 2011, which was held in the Economy History of Sinalo as a first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdes, also called a year of change, which made great hopes for the development of the economy, but, taking into account the unfair climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no increase, however, a reduction of the main economic development indicators was registered.
The low temperatures of February led not only to the loss of millions for the agricultural sector, but they had the opportunity to increase the public economy, increasing economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly by the history of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamic of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report of the areas, the suffering of the sea from the Council of Meka on sustainable agricultural development was 835.582 hectares, of which 78.03 per cent had suffered, and the remaining 21.07 per cent had been partly lost.
The economic activity decreased that, before November, the continuous growth of the national statistics and geography in the State, during the first three quarters was fixed in the growth of a level without a rate, from January to March 55.053 of Sinalo was unfair, by 4.53 per cent of the economic activ population, in the second quarter, he grew up to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September, he continued to grow up to 6.19 per cent, which, in the calculation of the quantity of people, exceeds more than 74.000 without assets in Sinaloa, that at 18.969 persons greater than the first half.
Decrease of liquidity
Without a complaint in Sinaloa, many factors have been discussed, for the economy Gerard Lopez Servantes, Director of the Economy and Scientific University (UAS), the growth can be explicitly explained by the actions undertaken in the public policy.
"What we see now is a growth without a factor, which is with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market, in order to make the resources imposed by the law adopted at the conference to take place with money denied, since people who have illegally owned dollars are not easy to work with them, to invest and to use them in anything," he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopez Servantes said there was a demographic factor in the growth.
"The number of people who leave the states in the search for borders was first placed in the United States because of the complication of income, and secondly - because, once they are running, they are already with a lot of difficulties in seeking work, so the group of people remains and requires a place of slavery here, in the state, resulting in a level without the work," he said.
Requirements
The analysis of the work market of Sinaloa becomes worse if a large number of deficiencies that are overwhelmed under the work conditions under INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the State works without being undertaken as a protective institution.
In addition to non-formational and insurance, another reminder of the State is presented lowerly; the lowest payments in the country are recorded by the Me of the Canadian Institute of Safety and the Ministry of Work and Worship.
The middle-month income of the slaves of Sinaloa was until September 5.352, much below the country, which consists of 7.375 pess.
AIDS reduction
In addition to the fall of economic activity and a high debt without the Property in 2011, the largest payment of the first foreign investment in the past 10 years, according to the Financial Ministry, has been estimated 630.697 dollars since July, which shows the fall of 87.74 per cent compared to 5.143.312 dollars in the same period last year.
The Ministry of Economic Development of the Government of the State is only 17.280,000 investment pess during the year that has mainly come to the company in the field of services.
Long
At the end of the economic fall, the Government of the State requested in July, at the meeting of the State, a credit approving at 3 billion dollars, which would be expected to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to survive the economy, only 2.600 million peses were approved, and until November there were no benefits in the state's economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Valdes demonstrates the failure of the Government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Palace of Industrial Trade, said that in 2011 the desires of different sectors, including only the Government of the State.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, it is to work a lot to return the positions lost in this year, in 2012 we must double our efforts, we have not able to do all efforts and, in particular, the good and synchronised new Government team, we hope that the year would be much better," he said.
Economy disturbance
Lopez Loredo said that such events, such as early injuries, have stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth in this year.
"The lack of economy I have been resulting from several events, including the mouse, one of the main effects was a long economy that has not become quick enough to create an economic dynamic that allows to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations," he said.
Direction Review
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Conference of the Me’kanian Republic in Sinaloa, said that the State must continue the most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we have found that we have worked on this, we believe that we need to describe a long-term programme that will re-determine the direction and the economic course of the state, and that all materials and resources of Sinaloa are needed," he said.
Present work
The President Coparmex stressed the importance of the definition of the future direction in order to improve the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to succeed in various areas, in terms of economic development, a little progress, but it is important to repeat the long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration of the manifester was progress in its own way of governing public policy.
"The facts that allow us to tell us that the Government begins to be involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government knows that much more is to do," he said.
He has been sentenced by 8 kg of marijuana
Five years of income and scraff in 100 days - such a sentence was issued to Navolato for eight kilograms of marihuana.
The general prosecutor reported that the convicted drugs operator, Omar Ale·s Valensuel Sandoval, condemned for a crime against health, was in this case the maintenance of marihuana in order to distribute.
According to the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valensuel Sandoval was arrested by the Canadian military 7 June 2010 in the cargo of Cyprio Waldes Street, before 80 in El Castilo, Navalato.
The drug traveler was behind the white car's picape, where he was carrying the black box in the car, and at the passport, a small rubber, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the exciting has been submitted to the Second Court, and the accused one continues to remain in prison in the Centre for the Support of Legal Consequences of Crime.
It is necessary to contribute to work
Common works relating to such programmes such as Rodin, the Saving of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are risked to remain incomplete or so long because of the lack of funds, Miguel Anhel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of the Municipal Development indicated that, despite the development of the programmes, they are in danger, since the Government of the State is not able to make the corresponding contributions that covers the amount of 11 million pess for all three programmes.
He noted that the general implementation of all three programmes consisted of approximately 50 million cancers from which the state should have 25 per cent, and that only the Federation and the Municipality were able to provide resources for work, thus still a delay with their end.
"They have to add almost 12 million, and although the year ends, they didn't give us any copies when they had to give us a part from beginning of July," he said, "in order to not repair, we started working and they were very moved, but we need money."
He mentioned that in the past year, during Jesus ’ governance, the State did not contribute to him, so at the beginning of the administration of the munity, money had to be taken to cover more than 7 million, which was not granted to the State administration.
"This happened to us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial instruments to participate, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year to access these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the State has left," he explained.
Although the State authorities have the commitment to deliver these resources, he says that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Viljereal, to increase efforts so that the percentages related to them are as soon as possible.
"They have to bring nearly 12 million, and even though it ends a year, they didn't give us any coppers."
The Court will approve "the transition of digital television" in Meʹka in 2015
The replacement of digital signals is one of the most important changes that have reached the world in the past years.
The Supreme Court rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the Palestinian representatives against the presidential decree, which transfers the so-called " transition to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, since no eight votes were approved for its cancellation.
A minority of four ministers, including the Chairman of the Court, Juan Silva, considered that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded its powers by decreasing the detailed description of the ability to transite to digital land TV.
The constitutional claims claimed by the Senate have been rejected in force of the lack of a qualified majority of eight voices that is necessary for the court to submit the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by the Ministry of Olgoy Sanches Cordero was to declare a decree of non-constitutional, since the regulation of the radio and television programme is a law established by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) in accordance with the principles of yer-subordination and reserve.
Only Salvidar, Horhe Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanches Cordero spoke about the project.
According to this argument and Senate and the Deputate Court, two constitutional negotiations made in order to deal with the decree and support of complaints, Minister Sanches Cordero stopped the application of the decree and all actions mentioned in it to the digital meeting.
At the meeting of Ministers, it was also decided to reject the request of the Deputate Palace without taking into account the draft discussion and also under the responsibility of Minister Sanches Cordero.
In his words, the Prime Minister said that he was not with the arguments of the project in the meaning that the federal executive authority cannot determine the common rules for which the public administration should be prepared.
"I don't also believe that if this happens, this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and I believe that the planning of public policies in the fields such as telecommunication sector has regard to the federal executive authority with a constitutional mandate, the governance of the State.
The replacement of digital signals is one of the most important changes that have been made in the past years, leading to the best use of the radio-electricity, the best quality of the signal and more channels.
The replacement of transition, he said, would mean to replace the benefits of converting into digital forms, including the satisfaction of public needs, which has not only technical dimensions, "as it covers economic, political issues and national security issues."
These questions, he said, "the whole system developed by the principle of the public economic governance includes a group of authorities which the Constitution units to the public executive authority."
He claimed that a large number of countries throughout the world had already completed the transition to the digital meeting, and did it with the executive authority, despite the cohesion of technical institutions.
In this regard, the Government concluded that, taking into account the decree discussed, which in any case concerns the Congress' competence, the Government ensures the compliance of the laws adopted by the Legal Assembly.
In Michoacan, the " vote vote" can be analysed.
According to the data submitted to the PRC, the difference between the first and second place of Governing Elections consists of only 27 per cent, even without a summary of votes combined by 879 from the total number of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of the " vote to vote" is real that the process of elections in Michoacan in this year, where the difference between the first and the second place of the Governing Board is 27 per cent, even without the summary of the votes combined by 879 from the total number of 6 74 protocols.
In the light of this Chairman of the General Council of the Michoakan Institute of Elections, Mary de Los Anheles Lyanderal Saragos, the electoral body adopted the package of principles to establish the rules of the Federal Electoral Reform.
As it should be said, Michoacan did not accept the Constitution or the Election Code of State or the Legal on Electional Rights, since the State Congress approved reforms so far as the legal period of their entry into force in this electoral process and the Governor Leonel Gody Rangel did not include it within the period set out in the Official Journal of the State.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (EUS) adopted a decision on the constitutional claim issued by the Legal Assembly and called the "ineffective and illegal" voice of the representative of the State on Constitutional Reform, since he has no right to "open or support them".
In the interview of the possibility of " voting by" Mary de los Anheles Lyanderal, the appropriate principles by the General Council of the IWM would be a part or full summary of votes by the electoral body.
Yes, the partial calculation of one or more election urnes may be produced in terms that: the results of the protocols are not covered; no voting and summary of documents in the urine or the President is not at the time of the report; or when there are evidence errors or corrections in the protocol.
Furthermore, the general summary of votes in all elections may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the candidate's proposed winner of the elections and those receiving the second place in voting, less than one per cent, in the beginning of the session, is a request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition, which you are the second of the candidates.
The common review of the votes will also be made if at the end of the ordinary summary the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than one per cent, if there is a request from the political party whose candidate has taken the second place, where the election of the hours is excluded in the part of the review.
It is important to note that there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRC, the difference between the first and the second place only 0.16 per cent, not even 129 votes from the total number of 923 protocols.

The body of the other man, the red rubber, and the golf of the jungles, was practically one meter.
All three lied down with the face.

The new Italian Government will be developed in the middle of
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet the President of Italy tomorrow in order to meet the new Government, which conflicts with the crisis imposing this country in the context of economic disasters.
The Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet in the middle of the president of Italy in order to make a new Government coherent with the crisis imposed by Italy in the context of economic disasters and the damage of the entire zone.
The statement from the presidential court stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet in the middle of the President, George Napolitano, to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that he will have a office that is mainly composed of the technologies, although it is not understandable when the new executive authority will take its positions.
Monty said that he would give the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his efforts to form the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to get out of this complex period," said the former Commissioner of the reporters.
Monty did not directly say that he was able to form the Government, but the tonne of his comments showed that the prejudices were overcome.
"Structure is now well decreased," he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming the Government less than in three days that is much less normal, since Italy has committed a political and financial crisis that has exposed their size at a critical level
The Administration under the lead of the former Commissioner of Monty must confirm the package of the heavy economy required by Peace leaders to return confidence to Italy.
Based on the pressure on Monty to make it quickly, the markets have established income with the BTP obligations of Italy for more than 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegalia, leader of the Italian Robotic Federation, reporters after meeting with Monty, said, "We said we would be actively supported by the Government."
We believe that this is the last chance of Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances were successfully supported by the LDP Partie Silvio Berlusconi, which was urged to leave the Sabbath because of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monty must lead to a good outcome," said the reporter Angelino Alphano, Secretary of the Centralist Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because many of its members have already resisted the Governing majority of the Technocrats, which is designed by Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have a strong Parliamentary support for reforms that will probably be a cruel economy.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and disruptive attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of insurance banks has strengthened pressure by warning that Monty's passion could be a disaster.
Monty began its consultations on Monday with political partys, unions and business groups, as well as young and female.
He'll finish his meeting on Thursday evening.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, who allowed a very quick passage to respond to the crisis.
After a short transfer last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi wi was released, the price of the debt of Italy has now reached a critical level of uncertainty is whether the new Prime Minister will be successful.
It would have been too much for the modern financial protectors of the Zone.
Monty said that his Government would take place before the elections appointed for 2013, despite the spread predicts that politics would only give him time to reform before the new elections were appointed.
Monty said that he wanted to include policies in his office, but the main party insisted that it should be composed of only technical experts, the witness of their deficiency by having an impact on the financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual uncertainty and non-parties are endeavoring to include political figures.
Experiences of game experience more than Ticos
From 22 players stated in Spain, ten were already played for 50 feet.
Only one of the 22 stated players of Costa Rica played 50 mads.
Increasing contrast with Costa Rica, comparing 22 players called by both countries to the company mad today at 3:05 at the National Stadium in San Hose.
While there are peace and peace champions, number one in the monthly review of FIFA, a full list of class A-selected games, Triclore has only a protector of Michael Uman as the only one who conducted 50 plays.
This number was held in the past Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named Romel Fernandes.
The Spanish footballists playing in the Ligue of all stars and in the strong clubs of the Premier-Lig of England were very active during this year in the ligue and in cubic compounds, and they are high-level players in the Cubs and the Champions Ligue.
This should be added to the experience of the Spanish Foury in a complex quantity of the world's or Championates.
The Ticos players, however, have been experienced in the area of the KONKAKAF, which is considered the lowest level in the FIFA.
We see the list of the Spanish Collection Hooker Iker Kaʹjes, who was repeated the record of the Ex-Golker Andoni Subissaret, with 126 mads last Sunday against England (math played 0-1 in London).
Ca’as is playing against Triclore today and set up a new record in 127 feet for Spain.
Havi Ernandes, Barcellona player, 106 mads.
Ca'as and Havi were recognised as the best last week with the other player of the Iberian team, the Subsarreth, with 126 mads and a bombarder of Shalke Raulem Gonsales with 102.
Almost comes to a hundred Carles Powell with 97 games.
Havi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres - 90, David Willa and Serchio Ramos, both of 81, Andres Innesto - 62, Sesk Fabregas - 61 and David Silva - 53.
On the side of Costa Rica near Michael Umana, the left side of Hunior Dias with 48 peaks and the Brian Ruis bombarder is 45.
Furthermore, only five moves to 30 games: Caylor Navas from 31, Rendell Asopheifa with 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Ernandes from 36 and Hose Louis Lopez 35.
Leave it.
More than 30 mads in Spain at Gerar Pike (37), Serchio Busquets (36), Santi Casorlah (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
In a collection of less than 30 outcomes on the field, Roy Miller with 26 mads, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Muri from 23.
The remainers have not reached up to 20.
While Nacho Moreal is only four, the games and Hordy Alba are two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder are not yet worth.
The leader of Spain David Willa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica Brian Ruis, those who brought more points, two times more than Carlos Ernandes and three times more than Roy Muri and Parks.
Quenthet included the country in tour for twenty years of career
The roof in Costa Rica is the former mind.
In an exhaustive interview of Viva Basist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam, the group was ready to give one of the best concerts on Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of expectation, but the group says that it is also a meaning for them to play in this country.
This was with the basis and the founder, Jeff Amenth, who was an exclusive Viva interview last week.
The group is located in the South America territory within the twenty-year-old work and on Sunday, 20 numbers will make its only residence in Central America.
On this day, they will be at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 a.m., together with the team from Los Angeles The X and the Group of Las Robertas.
This is a broadcast of the conversation that is full of discryption available in The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, it's the fact that Pearl Jam's playing in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans experience?
The roof in Costa Rica is the former mind and for us too.
It's just our second visit in South and Central America, and until everything's fine.
I was in Costa Rica only once - in the department, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That is why we are very happy to bring our home there.
I am asking this because there is some loyalty to the group; the fanates will be pressured in days before the concert.
What will you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
We needed almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry we needed so much time to get here.
People, in expect of your concert, refer to him as the greatest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
From the greatest show we played in the past 21 years, we had been in the last two weeks.
We have conducted a few beautiful shows in San Paulo and we hope that this has brought us into a form for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love to work with serfining and jungle that is cossing these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her wings for serfing?
We have a lot of serfer friends, and I have a good friend living in Tamarinda, and the whales here are incredible.
My friends are always able to work as a serfining in Costa Rica and Niègua, as well as in Me ́cu, these are different places for serfing, as we have learned about, from people who love serfining.
Looking at the tour, you can say you've made a great show with a song.
What have you planned to speak in Costa Rica?
Because we never played there before, we have no idea what we can do.
We're trying to make a better show of the most different songs; we're trying to play a few songs from each album and to make our fans a big diversity of the recipient.
You never repeat the recorder.
How do you get that?
I think we're part of this because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's difficult to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in tone and deceives us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and what we could forget.
This makes a show more interesting for us, and I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour you're noting 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it difficult to believe in everything you've done?
Yeah, sure.
First, I think no one of us could never say that we would be in the rockgroup and that we're doing this more than 20 years does it look like a mind.
We rejoice in our happiness and we are very excited in that we can continue to create a joint.
We all love each other and we love creating.
We're happy to go through the world where we always wanted to go.
Everything is very successful for us.
What does it mean to be a significant part of the grain flower for you?
It was always the honour to be part of this group of big collectives.
We're good friends with the boys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's nice when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it's unusual.
One group of one city has been developed from time to time, but far more strange when five or ten groups are held at one time in one city.
We are fierce and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I'm playing with some of them for a while.
Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with them all and to be a part of the sound of Sietla that got.
It is also very strange that your group remains together and in the same time is so long.
Yes, four of us were 21 years together, and Ma ́ (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is very longer than many groups.
First, I think we're happy that we're still alive, and second, we're gonna take care of others.
We were all very close friends and, thanks to this, were also opened by the ways that give every experiment freedom.
We trust each other, and it couldn't be better.
Your attitude towards the word of glory was unclean; but thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
When we were growing up, it became more likely to find a balance.
We'll be concerned not too long in tour because it's easy to fall into this game of big people and people who love your own.
Until you remember that people here for the purpose of this, it reminds you that you have to respect and what you have done, without determining to be famous and rock stars, what no one of us will really forget.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're really writing good songs, and at first it was great.
We were a group of nearly three years, and we did not release any albums until Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
It was very disappointed because it was so long, and the most important thing that we were until this couple of close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the group, and when I heard the song or see the graph, I think of an incredible person who was Andy, and as he made me ridicule, it was always the pleasure to go, ridicule, talk about the matter and football and many others.
It was a wonderful man, and we're looking for him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her, especially Eddie Veder, and so you've chosen her to open it?
Yes, the manufacturers sent us a few video proposals, and it was a group that liked us more all, so we don't suffer to see that Las Robertas could offer a lifetime, and that must be very impressive.
Why do you always change your words in Yellow Ledbetter on concerts?
This is the question of Eddie Veder, so I don't know.
He's kissing her and I think he's using the first thing he's coming in.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
They're so much.
Among the first ones who come to mind, Gizer Batler, John Antwist, Si Jay Ramon, John Dou, Paul Cartney, Chuck Dukovski...
They're so much that I can talk all day about the bases I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the accuracy of the grange, despite that he is not in mode?
I think we all feel some deafness from the word of Grange.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all who appear at the same time, and if it is important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a thing to listen, and the teams like Mudhoney now create better than ever.
In the beginning, your position was more dark, and now it became more powerful.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there's a few songs in the album that can seem more, but there's songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered very dark, even though they can sound a little.
From both, when Ed played them, I wept when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think when you're going, and in your life there was some traumatism and you lost a family or a friend, these events begin to affect your creation and your own, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
I think you can be a happy man, and you can still learn to create a dark man.

The Government of Uruguay has been trying to conclude tax exchange agreements in recent years to leave this " series list" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization consisting of countries which do not use tax cooperation standards.
As a result of the trade plan, the Me'aky and Uruguay have been forced by the Free Trade Agreement (STS) since 2004, which increased the trafficking between two countries.
The water driver will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought more than 25 years to save Princess Pich from the bad lap of Bouzer, but never before he did this in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he would fight for love in the stereoscope.
From the worldwide stores in this month, the Nintendo 3DS porting console was created, which allows playing in three dimensions without the need for the use of eyes.
"Mario is a hero who should tell how a stereoscope will work without eye," said the Nintendo Press Service Chapter in Spain, Omar Alvares, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvares said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game, especially played under this form", because the successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adapting games.
The representative Nintendo stated that, despite 3D playing, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows to enjoy a quick and swimming game.
Alvares said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part of "easy" for less experienced users.
One time, most of the experts were drinking at the second round of the games that are more complex at this time.
Moreover, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or those who only affect the depth of action, but on which they need to play in three dimensions to overcome different obstacles and "not be given optical illusions".
This involvement of Super Mario in three dimensions also refers to the return of the heroe to the Portative Console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo submits the serial fanates and repeats the successful form from the previous games, the waterbuilding driver with everything must go on the dangerous department to free Princess Pich.
However, the player will find new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as "player" Luidji.
The Room guarantees the extradition of Portillo in the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Monday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo began to answer in the United States for 70 million dollars.
This is the process that Guatemala responded to the request of a northern country that required the issue of Portugal to judge it there.
At the press conference, Col said that its decision was independent of the judicial and executive authority, taking into account that the court of the first institution had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he did not " add hands" to legal decisions and adopted all extradition procedures he had ever known.
Instead, Portillo Serhio Ruano Marrokin will be exploded for murder and severe physical damage, as well as Edgar Estrad Morales and Victor Estrad Parades, both for drugs.
What was done by the Column shows an executive process after all legal and constitutional courts were dismissed in order to pursue the ex-country of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In the decisions of the Fifth Court of Auditors and the Constitutional Court (CS), Portugal will be issued once with a decision on its legal position in Guatemala and the guarantee of human rights.
The Portillo was recognised as innocent in the discharge of Q120 million in the Defence Minister for the Presidency, which was a process of previous extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs gave a call and opened the case again.
Trinianov helped 6,000 young people from a group of risks
Organization was created to prevent the marginalism of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trininova support organization: 6.000 young people under isolation have helped to overcome difficult situations during this fourth century.
This should be added to more than hundreds of slaves created for the group.
The anniversary served as a field for the results of the ceremonie conducted in Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared close to the Bell Trinity in 1986 in order to help young people with lack of education, lack of drugs and problems.
The celebration in Sant Andreu yesterday has collected a large number of responsible organizations and agencies that cooperated with association in these 25 years.
The different political presentation in the elections showed the one character of the work made by Trinijove.
After the President of Generality, Arthur Mass and his president Hordy Puchola, the ceremonie had visited the ex-consultator of Education, Ernesth Margal, and the ex-leancent of the Meeting and the current eco-co-socialist, member of the Municipal Council of Ricard Goma.
Fabra I Coats also appeared by the current adviser on the issues of well-being and family, Hosep Lewis Claireis and SEC on La Ca, Haum Lanasp.
He said that Trinianov had appeared to light at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done before these pounds "is a good basis".
The President introduced Trinieve as an example of fight against bad circumstances and the universe of hope in people who experience difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for her organization and work," he said.
Evacuated from where mass feasts were organized
Ockup captains of 11 of the 13 stages of the Balmes Street, 51
12 Occupants left from yesterday to midnight without fighting
It seems that the cosmar, who survived neighbors in Balmes Street 51, ended.
Twelve people volunteerly left from which they were illegally occupied and where they organized massive festivals that disrupted the neighbors, in decision of the court without the police.
When the operation was completed, the door closure was changed to prevent the situation.
"From this time there will be a travel control," said the manager.
Square, who took 11 of the 13 stages of view, remained inhabited, all electricity and part of water, broken walls and left tracks of different types, especially banks under alcoholic drinks.
The first three stages were a place for mass feasts that were long for two days and disturbed the owners.
The contrast is with the night club, Balmes 51, which has also been threatened.
The Government, Mary Pantinat, reported Europe Press that since the employment was taken, its income was reduced to 80%.
The Government of the Club states that the consequences invoked it in wrong practice, since they sold drinks for three, while in the club for 10.
Moreover, the owner of the discote was to respond to the complaints of the neighbors to the voice, although, as she noted, the voice was called by non-club visitors, but by the inhabitants of the claims, and, in particular, those who visited the festivals that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of their growth, as told by the divorced neighbors.
The lady club said that the inconvenients were so big that she had even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and that's about nine months ago, as he's "forgiving" her the payment of the money.
The city police also confirmed that in the last weeks there were more claims from the neighbourhood to the situation.
The President of the Municipal Group of PP, adviser Alberto Fernando Dias, needed to "evacuate immediately from" last week to resolve the problems of the commitment and of the general spirit of the neighbors and degradation in this area.
The Pope leader explained that only one stage of convictions had been taken before the year, but in the last few months, the squatters were involved in all stages and practically every place and that some of them had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "the end of the impunity should be made and that it must be resisted to the uncleanness that is created in the opinion."
Evacu police members of New Barris yesterday.
At 15:30 the police went out to Montral Street, 35 after having received a call from the neighbor who noticed how four people entered from.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architecters have the possibility of concurrence after advertising the contributions
The Municipal Concurrence on 16 doors repeated the debates on the role of the College in Barcelona
In the middle of the 80th, at the end of the Barcellona Staff Corporation (CBS), this administration printed a broadcast for Colserola.
Bucklet described the mountain as a big park of Barcellona.
Moreover, this was compared to pictures with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CCB, in 1987, the park took place again in the knowledge of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few who were not oriented north-south, but above (both) below (sea).
Colonel's position as a natural park will oppose this idea.
It was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild caban in the role of Yogi.
It was so until in September, the Council announced a great complaint from 16 competitors at other gates in Colserol.
Under the doors, the idea of the park is not sure.
Or anybody wants to put the door on the field.
The question is one: Colserola, a park or a mountain?
With implementing, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, I am the subject of discussion of all Barcelone entities.
Is it not the most repeated issue that is discussed when two members of this class of chosen people are familiar with each other in the lift?
And this is exactly one of the few coincidences between the three Barcelona students and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modelo and Mara Bayon: adequate training
For Roldan, after reaching the rubber line, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "previous side of the mountain", when the proposal of Eldefon Serda, the mountain with green eggs, was not discussed.
"We must admit that the biggest Barcellona Park is a floor.
Moreover, thanks to his access.
"Colserol is more complex," says the director, for which the "Port of Colserol" contains "the vocabulary": "We should not think of them "as the income in the park, but as about some areas where we need to make."
The model, like Roldan and Bayon with experience in the city building, called the proposal "intelligent tasks" with "certain dangers".
The risks resulting in the "indetermination of public space predictation" after the 80th experience, which ended on For's "they Lebeth Song".
The first fear is the own border where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the step," means the transition.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [which is in the General Staff Plan (H^)] can lead to real disaster."
More close to the matter, the Model believes that the simplification of the Colserol valley "can be considered as a park, Barcelone, not" as a pure topographic question.
The model recalls that there is already a job made by Calzerola, which "not should be missed by ears," although it is grateful for the possibility of Mary to enter into this project "after the beginning".
Moreover, it understands that the nearby mountain to the city is a transition that allows the debaters to enter, but "He doubts" is whether this technical profile is the one that should be guided by the interdisciplinary teams ("heirs", he approves), which should have been created: "Architects must be only a tool."
Byona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the name of this part is combined because the rules of the concurrence are not sufficient for the general species of the Colserol: "16 cross-sections have been announced," he says, "in the meaning of the sea-berg, but there is no longer reading here to see and understand the area as whole."
This will at least decide to participate in 16 competitors.
On the other hand, the draft for one gate can be crossed by the programme and the definition of the draft of the Neighbourhood gates.
From your view, the Council is able to ensure that the road directly over Ronda de Dalt should ensure its full area to create a flowing cross between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrassabal and he will be free
After 72 days of the arranged judge, Red Casino forgave the brother of M. Montrei in the process of accusation against him.
After 72 days held in the Year, Manuel Jonas Larrassabal will be released after the Legal Representative of Red Casino gave him excuses before the Second Court of Auditors, which was the process of demand against the brother of M. Montrei.
After Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Serchio Gil Garcia, had a series of graphs and videos where Manuel Jonas had to pay economic contributions to allow Montree's authorities to have a secret oper in the inner house.
After public sentence, the General Prosecutor opened the vote against the brother of the Mar, and on 2 September he was arrested and held for 30 days.
Following four hours before the State Department of Heritage, he was sent to a temporary staff located in the former part of the State's capital.
In this context, he remained 49 days, following the provisions of the second proposal on the prohibition of movement after the prosecutor had excluded crimes on charges and organised crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to Caderate as a requirement of half million cancer from the owner of Red Casino, but he was there only a few hours in the middle of the isolation of prisoners because he was threatened to death.
The authorities allowed him to continue in the municipality in San Nicholas in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest proposal was issued by the Secretary of the Second Court of Auditors, Horche Janes, who said that after nearly two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence of Jonas' fault, such as 1.5 million cancers with the representatives of the Buckmeckers in exchange for the operation.
On Monday, the Legal Representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomes, presented the judge Hose Louis Pessino to request a favor for the brother of the member of the region, so he could receive freedom in time.
During the judgment, the State prosecutor, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether he was injured, and who of the inheritance partners would give mercy, although he was trying to do the name.
On the basis of 197/2011, the legal accusation was granted to Jonas Larrassabal and then made no statements on the basis of the process planned against it; no refund or penalty would be required.
After listening to the Legal Representative of the Buckmeckers, nearly at 15:50, it was invited to release Larrassabal Britannica immediately.
The Court of Justice, Horche Janes, was sent to San Nikolas' municipality in Garza to announce Jonah that he was legally forgiven and that his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate provision of the freedom signed by the judges.
Minister Dionicio Press Hacome reports the details of the disasters in which the Ministry of Internal Affairs, France Blake, and seven more people have died.
The Ministry of Relations and Transport (MST) reported that the results received in an accident that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of France Blake More and seven other people had shown that the wallet had been struck directly on the ground in full integrity without trying to make a accident.
During the press conference, Dionicio Press Hacome, the Ministry of Relations and Transport, said that before the aircraft was raised up, the pilot discovered that the good conditions were appropriate for the aircraft.
"The elements that, guess, that the ship had a few contacts with the land, have been contacted with the woods at 25 meters where the ship lost flashing."
He also reported that the ship was designed for 19 persons, respectively, complied with the requirements for transport of people.
He also said that the investigations carried out in the area of attacks were not reported about the nature of parts on earth.
"The investigation reports that there are no ship components other than a struggle in the state of structural integrity.
"The Virtolet was designed for 19 passengers, which satisfied the relevant requirements for passenger transport.
The earth in this area has a decline from seven to 30 degrees.
At that point, the secretary said, mainly, to obtain the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation may take a few months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Mayer, Director-General of Airports and WSPOGEGO, said that during the attack of the presidential headquarters, the Craice speed was managed and that happened on a slightly higher ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the usual annual manner at the time of the attack," he said.
At the press-conference, the owner of SCT, Press Hacome, recalculated six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the rules of the aircraft, the road was under the rules of the visibility of the aircraft, which means that the team should be visible during the aircraft and land.
Annual conditions:
The AICM reports had adequate conditions for the evacuation when the aircraft was made to the border territory between Mexico and the Metica State, where cloud layers were observed at lower height.
Selected paths:
The team may have been looking for a smaller higher area and more visible in the Queernavac valley.
Location of hits.
The coordinates of the attack and the last records of the aircraft are probably not lost or changed by the aircraft.
Small border splitting:
The information available to these ports indicates that the attack has reached the front and side line.
The disruption of the clouds makes it clear that the land has been combined under the conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion was found:
There are no evidence of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire in the areas of disasters.
The results of the recent studies have been found that there could be an earlier contact with the land.
During the employment, the aircraft was found at 9.200 feet higher than the sea level, and the land has a decline from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show the impacts of it was spread on the road.
Included the facts that it could have been a few conflicts with the earth.
Following a higher territory investigation than a determined area near the place where the disaster occurred, there were no splitted parts of the aircraft, which strengthened the view that the attack had occurred under the conditions of structured integrity.
MSS announces a gene-sequence programme
Social protection leads to a study on the search of genes of genes of kids and youths; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Canadian Protection Institute (MSSI) announced me that it was conducted an investigation in order to detect the gene of fertility in children and young people, which received the name of the " Genetic Feeding in Age and Age" Protocol, which would provide a number of signs that have been given to the exhaust weight.
In its statement, the Chapter of Medical Research Agency of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the XXI century Miguel Cross Lopees explained that a multiprofit team of therapeutics, medical sisters, diotheologists and professionals was collected.
This team is assisted by the Specialists and Aspirants of the National National Society Institute (NIPH) and the Centre of Scientific and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Political Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prohibited or not) is invited to participate in the MSSI centres that participate in the investigation, to the valley of Mexico, where each Sabbath, at 8:00 tomorrow, tests will be carried out with children.
He highlighted that the Protocol began to be sent to the Centre of Kuwaitmoke (on the western of Mexico) and from 8 October, the activities passed into the Nesaulkiotle Centre (East of Mexico).
Following the objective of 500 to 600 children, the investigation will continue in the South Mexican Independence Centre and, finally, in the Centre of Morelos (Northern Mexico).
He explained that the goal of this study was to understand genetic complexity and importance in the development of heat and to establish the risk factor between children and young men in order to warn the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, the World Day of Conflict with Diabetes will be noted, and the main goal is to collect three thousand children and adults from 6 to 14 years of age from the authorization of parents and under their supervision of individual food actors.
They will also ask for the activity and the history of family heritage diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or insufficiency.
He explained that in the Sabbath anthometric measurements of all participants (weight, growth and talia), blood pressure measurement and levels of glucose, animals, cholesterine and insulin and genetic analysis (in order to detect genes that are with the aggression).
Cross Lopes said that this study reflects the concern of health professionals in the conduct of anxious increase in weight among children.
In medical studies from 1999 to 2006, it states that only six years had growth: in the case of 77 percent of boys suffered in the case of a girl, 47 per cent; that is a wheat, there has also been observed growth," said the MSSI specialist.
He said that the foundation of the markers' search is that the population of the country is different from other peoples by its genetic history.
He concluded that in the average of 65 per cent of the American Indian descendants, 30 per cent of the seed and five per cent of the African descendants, and that was reflected in genes that were diabetes and a deficiency weight.
He explained that the consequences of the gear genetics are mainly the insufficiency of the body to burn the energy expenses we use (calorie), and it is reflected in the form of grass.
Studies explained that the direct benefit for participants is a comprehensive group of children, which may discover whether they have a degree of weight or weight.
Even, he said, the appearance of dark stocks on the hair (agents) and before them means the likelihood of metabolism and even prediabeth.
Incompetence involves all confidentiality, the doctor before it is written to parents who explain all measurements and changes in the form of life that must be taken to avoid diseases.
Cross Lopez explained that there are three main reasons that provoke the vital weight, heating and other chronic diseases: a seat of life, or a lack of daily activity, a larger part of the day of the house before the television, and the use of transport at small distances instead of to pass through.
This is also because of high calories, which also increases the use of sweet drinks and wood waters (male, bread, pics, hamburgers, etc.) with a large content of animals and proteins and genetical prevention analysed in this programme.
The UNAM Asfalt will be able to avoid the wheat
Raphael Errer, an investigation of the UNAM's high school, had a polymer-modified bit to produce a mixture of the best quality that was sustainable for the implementation of the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by the road cover were taken into consideration, it would be necessary to restore approximately 200 thousand heaps for each season of rain in the valley of Mexico, Raphael Errer Naher, the investigations of the UNAM's high school, and adds that if the process of building and content of the asfalted road cover is governed, the number of heaps may be reduced or totally set up to zero.
In his lesson, the Technological View of the Jam read in the International Year of Chemicals reports that the laboratory for which it is responsible develops a polymer-modified bit for the production of mixture with characteristics close to the bit, but with the best opposition and at high and low temperatures.
Errera Naher said that this type of modified bits could be used in places where the time is extremely swimming, as in some cities in the north to improve the quality of the road and, therefore, the opposition to food education.
He explained that the bith, the weakest part of the oil, is the results of the molecule in the waterwood, one is a high milk of the milk called asfalten, and others are a low milk of the milk of the male males, which together cover its characteristic behaviour.
The behaviour of the bith is the fact that at high temperatures of approximately 180 degrees he has been like heavyness, at 120 degrees, and at 50 degrees in Celsius he maintains a closely firm with, while the bitumin becomes very low, he said.
This means that the opposition to the street asfalt is not permanent, but is changed during the day, depending on natural and temperature, said the specialist in the field of the hymney engineering.
The researcher noted that the streets of Mexico were mainly covered by a liquid cover, consisting of six levels of material, of which three recently included bitumin.
There is a bit consisting of small stones in the bit and then pressed.
Each stone that contains this cover, he said, he was buried in a bit.
In moving vehicles and exhibition of efforts, this helps the strength to deal very well with the road covering.
If that was a modified asfalt, they would be better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
At the asfalt cover, he added the last layer, which is called the layer of the output made from a small stone, actually the fish that is also covered in asfalt.
Since this layer will contact the transport wheels, it must have more opposition than asfalt covering and ensuring the road trend.
I have a part of the road covering that will receive and distribute the effort, and the export layer also requires the appropriate size, and it is necessary to take into account the material from which it is produced.
Weather, especially temperature heat and overlap, is also very important to consider, especially water, because it has a significant effect on the asfalt.
When the water is covered and it is difficult to get out of there, it causes all the levels of covering and thus eating education.
When he was trained, he said that the first level of export was exhausted and only then it was affected by a bit, but the damage does not occur instantly, which should be given attention to the first characteristics of the current reform programmes.
The Member of the National Research System also explained that the transport load is another important factor in the training of a dry, and therefore the size of each covering level must always be with transport load and need to ensure that this requirement is fulfilled in order to prevent the frequency of the feed.
Raphael Errera said that many still need to study and make bit-emulsions, for example, that are already on the market in other countries and even helped to make the jams easy and without use of high temperatures.
What was not enough for the candidate from Vale to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the reasons that the Serne Meline Ramires had to get the crown of Miss Columbia.
The representative of Vale received the title of the princess at 14 times.
On the other hand, Vale Del-Kauka was just wanting to get the coronary of Miss Columbia.
In this time, Melina Ramires Serna had to be pleased with the department of winners with a silver crown and a lamp that announced her new princess Columbia.
Having regard to the result, last night in Cartachen, where Mrs. Atlantic wined a crown and scepter, the department counted 14 titeled princess, and Melina was attended to a woman from Vale Del Cauca, who were near the coron, but was announced by princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominage (1949), Patricia Beline Aila (1979), Lorenna Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leela Blanke (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sansuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Rose Ichabal Rose Alsa (1983), Ola Maria Arena Arena (1987), Lea Blanke (1989), Monica Everce (1989), Maria Sunsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Almore (1993), Al-93), Al-Hiro (2007, Al-Hare (2007, Al-Hares (2007), Al-Hares (2007),
A question that is now behind many:
Because the result of the primary favory, which in each of the expressions of the demonstrator, has everything to be a new Miss Columbia, it was not just that it was chosen by the Queen Police and the most beautiful person in Vogue - the titles of the Queen, such as Tatian Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the corones of Miss Columbia.
The first factor that played a role in the decision of jury to condemn her the title of the First Princess was that she did not have a convinced answer to the question "What book characterizes you and why?, given by Martin Murille Homes from the literature society Let us consider.
She answered the questionnaire:
"I am reading much, I believe in literature, I think it's an accommodation, and I'm definitely thinking that the book that characterizes my emphasis is "Small Prince" is a quite deep book.
Today, I read the "Progress and Penalty" is the leader of the world literature that we all should read; and at this point I read the book of Irina Nemiro, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Gar of Blood".
The answer that did not like the jury because of the term "occulture" and, secondly, because he did not explain specifically how each of the quoted books characterizes it.
But after Melina's ceremonie, she said she was quiet and satisfied with her result, "inhabited wise, it's going to happen."
And you all, please, read a little bit, "Small Prince" is a big book."
In the middle of sound hypotheses, Vale is a degree of favoritism.
The reporter from Godotha suggested that, since it was preferred to meet actions, it was a candidate who had received all the prevention of the rewards (culinary with the exercise of Ostera, the voice of the best national costume, and the Queen-Mama), "which raised the ability of other candidates, resulted in the stress of the Queen, and as a result it did not blink on the scene."
And it was noted during her first occurrence in the kitchen at Hillton's beach and during its two shows on the dinner coronation.
Although it was sure in both of them, it was noted that she had no power and energy demonstrated by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariael Ozorio, journalist of the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called Princess, "signs that a candidate who wins more reward during the concurrence does not become a Queen."
Moreover, the Representative of Vale has recently avoided the communication with the pressure, and it was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vale has lost an attempt to convince the jury in its interests in the Property, which is finally the existence of the National Concurrence of Krass.
That is why two days before the election of a member of the international July of Lucy Dotti said they were looking for a woman responsible for their country's needs.
"One beauty is not enough for Mrs. Columbia, we should look not only on outside but also focus on public knowledge before they participate in the competition, they should already be in the projects," she said.
There is also a view that the representative of Vale has sinned in the defects of the peculiars and phybroses that was seen in her life, but it is important, since the jury ́o noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physicality.
The Royal Royal Advisor Horche Ernan Orosco notes that Melina had no better body that had, "but the problems of the phybrosis on life that were not very noted for me, have made it lose the points last day."
Yet, the journalist Guido Oios in the magazine also believes that the mistake of the Vale de Cauca was the fact that she had been involved in the surgery.
"The operations are good, but the representative of Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body has never been her privilege, and here she has been punished for it.
The prize, which was first invoked by the organizations of the National Concurrence of Beauty, has occurred a cruel predict last night, says that it was a boy whom Rimondo gave Melina as a compensation for the relief that she had left the pleasure to get a crown.
So this is or not, the fact that Melina is beginning today, not as a Queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia on one of the complaints expressed directly by the National Concurrence Agencies.
However, she is in history, as one of the kings, who, despite its exciting statement on the concurrence in Cartagen, agreed with complexities in receiving crowns.
That was the work of a man who recognized the body of Alfonso Cano.
Criminalist from Cally entered the history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November, CTI Calley, criminalist, entered the history as a person who confirmed the identity of the FARC Chapter Alfonso Cano, compared to his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working in the CTI this week, Elizar Gonsales, a man from Puerto Tehada, who had conducted 21 years in court investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzáles worked in the towns of Choko, where he often had to pass over five days through the jungle to reach places where the body was to identify.
In 2000, he moved to Vale and after the corresponding courses he was specialist in the crime area, where he studied the trees of skin, i.e. ladone and stone.
On the week of the operation of Elizar for human recognition, like Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes not more than three days.
Something big came.
On Friday night, he arrived at the Cooke's holiday to Palmir.
He knew that he would have to recognize two bodys, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who had appointed the oldest parts war in the world, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the pictures of Gilermo Leon Saens (her actual name).
However, when he came from the group’s investigations to the place where the body was found, he did not recognize it in the outer form; he was very different from what was done in the media.
He was without a man, clothed as a farmer, without eyes, and much worse.
But the prints aren't.
Increasing glass, refrigerator, cocktail, and football, Elizabeth spent the fingerprints of the body with those on the photos.
It was Alfonso Cano.
At the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehada requested to confirm the Ministry of Defence of Juan Carlos Pinson that this was the leader of the RVSK
Search for fingerprints
For the specialist of the Sijin Department of Cali, the recognition received by President Huan Manuel Santos Elizaro Gonzáles at the press-conference on the operation against Cana is ́o.
Many people don't know our work.
Yes, it is a strong science, without error, it can play a key role in discovering crimes.
In addition to the body's identity, specialists to slovopies participate in the investigation of crimes such as furnishing and murdering and establishing the identity of the detained.
Many criminals have certificates or have no documents when they are arrested.
We take their prints and look for them in the base.
The studies said that in the case of steel, he had to bring the wall of the house, because the wall was oppressed with hands to possess a seif, a full valuation and money.
"The walls are hard to work, because they are not me to be a pleasure for printing, but in this case we can make a picture of the whole stone and establish the person of a criminal who has participated in several stoles," he states.
The prints also helped to exclude or establish the participation of the suspicious in the cases of murder.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles under the library around him.
The consequences indicated that in the conclusion of the crime, a family could be suspicious and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottom were coincidenced.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was murdered, it proves that he was on murder.
The CTI specialist explained that there is a chemical or physical reaction at the place where there are prints.
When they are shown, they are using a bottle or a source to cut them out.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is a criminal database, or is entered into a register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of non-commentated Columbiants," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not all as shown in the CSI TV.
Just as not all the gold that bleeds, not all that you're touching, the rest of the prints on itself.
However, if possible, the comparison will occur.
"Injured people" abandoned the calls to the authorities of New York
Hundreds of protestants have destroyed the camp before the Zokotti area.
A part of the protestants heard the judgment of the court on the dilution of demonstrations from the area and was made to the neighborhood park.
The members of the "Wol-Street" motion sent the calls to the authorities of New York on Thursday, when they tried to go back, under the protection of the courts, on the Manhattan area, where they were evacuated on the light in trying to take another park of the Great Jablock.
Hundreds of protestants went up at Zukotti's area where they wanted to fall through a court show that allowed "injured people" to cut a camp in the area until the other part of the movement answered to the distraction, taking a park on the north of the city, where further arrests were held
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to break a camp in the area, we'll break a camp anywhere else and continue the fight against the return to Zukotti and through peaceful seats and demonstration," said one of the representatives of the "Wollow Street" motion.
Brey explained that the response of "injured people" to the evacu of the palace city, which was given by Mr. New York Michael Bloomberg, was made to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a position prohibiting the evacu of the camp and allowing demons to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, "injured people" came to the capture of a new park of the central streets of Canal-Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance of the Holland Toneel, which units New York and New Jersey, and is in the property of the Church of Trois.
At least a hour they could take this place, but then the police arrived and came to the arrest of some of the protestants, though Brey could not call the exact number, but Ephes said that he saw several journalists who were also in the hands.
The organization assures that a few hundred people stood with the palaces in the place where the delegation of religious leaders was sent to demonstrate support for the members of the movement, trying to express as a mediator in the field negotiations.
Instead, the Zokotti area, which is a private government, remains closed in the expectation of a court hearing appointed on this morning, in which the legislation of today's morning dilution of protesters will be considered.
The protesters, the leadership, brought and spread the copy of the court and even gave these copies to the police, protecting area, which led to "certain small consequences", said Brey, who stated that some police were demonstrators.
The judgement prohibits the authorities to conduct evacu members of the "Wol-Street" motion and to enable "the laws issued after the start of the arrest, or to prohibit the demonstrators to get again access to the park with the stores and other property which was previously used."
Mr. Bloomberg said to reporters that the city has stopped the opening of the public space and the demonstrators have been informed about it, but the laws do not allow them to broadcast the palace stores and spas.
The member of the Municipal Council was personally justified by the elimination of Protectors from the Zokotti area on the division of oper, where there were approximately 200 arrests, and the decision was taken because the protestants were "from the law."
Blumberg said that he had given the order to clean the area because it became "the place where people were not protesting, but violating the law and, in some cases, bringing damage to others" because "certain undertakings received threats" and the neighbors were threatened "for the threat of life's quality."
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that in the depth of the soul of Blumberg is more interested in the protection of the American slaves' financial interests," added the representative of the movement, which condemns the measure for "no respect for the freedom of word".
The responsibility for Wall Street's arrests also showed that they were intended to organize "ground action" on Thursday in interaction with public and professionals to remember the last two months of protests started on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will become Mary's girl in a special birthday TV
Instead, Michael Bible and other publishing Canadians will appear in the television program "Russel Peter's birthday" on 1 December.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in the "Bolsh Reparation", saved the Savior of Malibu, Banny in "Pleeboe", the wife of rock-music Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model will become the girl Mary in a special birthday show on the Canadian TV.
The part of the CTV television has announced today that Anderson with the crane (ballad executive) Michael Bulb and other publishing Canadians will appear in the "Russel Peters" television programme on 1 December, in the role of Mary's special role.
The CTV has today a television show frame, in which Anderson, also a broadly distributed video pornography on the Internet, where she figures together with her husband, a Möttley Crüe group of Tommy Lee, appears with a clothes like the Deva Maria, holding in the glasses of the cocktails that Jesus is exposing.
In this scene Peters, the Canadian Indian comic of origin, which recently expressed as a leader in the "My violent torpeda of truth" Turkey, appeared in Joseph's role.
In advice to Anderson and Peter, the CTV special birthday show teaches a Canadian song of Bulgaria, who at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires at the Argentine Model Louisian Lopilato and who also knows the number of scandals.

Japan reborn after Earth
WTO increased by 1.5 per cent by the internal consumption and ended the fall in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and has been controlled from a disruptive land of nuclear crisis, the greatest disaster transferred to the High Solar Country since the second World War
According to the first evaluations of the Government of Tokyo, the loss material was $30,000 million, which, despite the harmful world situation, passed.
After three invasion quarters, data from July to September have certainly been helped to turn the page: the PIB increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
In the second quarter, the Japanese financial year begins in March 2012, also focused on the fastest levels of growth from January to March 2010.
The regeneration may be often explained by the recovery of machinery equipment to restore areas that are deserted by land and after Sunanas.
In fact, companies increased their investment to 1.1 per cent against the decrease of 0.9 per cent of capital debt, observed since January to March, the first decrease after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the true interruption in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keinsean impulse, which calls for the crisis to strengthen or rebuild the infrastructure, using lips to grow from zero.
Japan was awakened, mainly through the development of the consumption of households, which now consists of 60 per cent of the Japanese PIB.
This indicator increased by 1% under the increase in car, travel and rest.
Claymo Yen
Tokyo before the internal market when yen, Japanese currency, became one of the "value-refugiation" elected investors who want to be released from the crisis in the area and the negative prognoses of the United States, a privilege that gives as a stone, to the number of exporters.
In a stronger currency, the valuable production is a serious impact for the country whose economic course is defined by the health of large technological companies.
Theota or Sonny, for example, commits an ian in their low indicators from July to September.
Until the markets continue to be deceived by EU periferia countries, the Government of Essichiko Nod does not reduce attention.
We should be careful about maintaining risks, such as deterioration of some foreign economys, impact in Thailand and rare increasing the value of yen, said the Minister for the Economic Policy of Motohis Fu yesterday.
And in fact, the pers are not to be able to excite.
Economy and Development Organization (OECD) reported that most countries have demonstrated evidence of economic activities in September.
A global economy indicator showed that the main forces are distorted.
Then he fell on four tens to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The race has even fallen below the average value of 100 points, after it was reduced to eight tens to 99.13 points.
Athens give a land for doubts again
Papadimos said that the correction would have, but the conservators would not sign any written commitment
With peripheric premiums for the risk and indefinition in parks, Greece continues to blame on the labirin, which is to be out of the major crisis of Peace.
The feeling that the "one" of the new transitional Government of Ellada is related to Brussels' most demands than the real political conviction, begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there is no structural repository, and that a determined period of determination may be insufficient for their application, the leader of the Conservative Party of the New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that it would not support new intense economy measures in any case and repeated its request for the new elections appointed for February 19.
The main task of this Government is to comply with the decisions taken on 26 October, Papadimos said yesterday by opening the parliamentary debates that are married tomorrow with this confidence in the new executive authority.
The Package of 24 programmes for the increase in population occupation, the reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax derogation will be the first new information.
However, the message of Samaras does not explain the consequences of his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing."
The leader of the conservators made more than one step in the EU and the MVFs, organizations that need to disturb 8.000 million who are urgently needed to Athena, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the Treaty.
However, the Committee of the Employment, still testing the effects of Papandrew's references in the style of everything or nothing, repeated that her requests are unique: she will not renew aid if the new Government and leaders of Greece will not sign "a written agreement without a double-sensitive and as possible."
The representative of the Ministry of Economy of Amadau Altafay said that the insides of the three may be " very quickly" returned to Athena to discuss the new Government, "which must be made for the payment of the sixth tranch" by 8.000 million, although the exact date is not yet indicated.
In the Greek club, it's enough for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "This is the tools of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "based" place of Spain for this type of financial
Spain "taught a visible place in the world in the field of microfinancing".
The Queen of Sofia in the last two decades said that in the last two decades, it became a second donor for the instruments of cooperation, whose " reality" was said that it was "and the progress, justice and hope for the best future of the faith in people".
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcreditation Sammy in Valjadolide with the conviction that " there is no doubt" that such actions are "completely" to achieve the Millennium objectives set up by the United Nations for 2015, and "with the aim of reducing the two numbers of people who are less than one dollar per day, is the level for which "poverty is fixed".
Spain "all still works" to expand the network of recipients throughout the world and make this task with all the "responsibility", says Sophia's daughter, and hopes that the efforts and achievements that will continue to be done until Thursday will " ensure the creation of new ways and best ways for the poorest people, and especially for women, "based recipients of these curtains".
There's "a lot of achievements" and "a lot of work we're doing with."
The Microcreditation Summit is not only a plane for the Property but also a form that contributes to " two main goals".
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that 175 million poor families would be retained by these financial services until the end of 2015 and that hundred million of these households would be chosen from the poverty in which they were threatened.
The Impuls for the creation of a microcreditation system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world " went on the road beginning year ago" Muhammed Younes, highlighted Mrs. Sofia as "the act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "proportional idealist in the general fight against poverty" whose work has been held for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study its credit policy.
This year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Cot'd'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen an improving development overall," said her Majesty who brought her the title "the head of the family" in the Valadelide "poor bankier".
Finally, the Queen of Sophia completed the statement, invited the present to participate in the discussion and decided to continue in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperial"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Trinidad Himines said that solidarity is "ethical empire" for each democracy of the State.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to co-operate with developing countries with the time of the economic paper, since it was "continuous commitment".
Himines concluded that microcreditation is " a serious and strong course for poverty and poverty," and now "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries must work as solidarity criteria and not allow it to be a victim of decreasing costs.
Microcreditation for Spain is " one of the main directions of development cooperation".
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraia Rodriguez, highly appreciated the "success" to give "certainty" to people "departed from which all doors were closed" and Mr. Valdadolid Francisco Haveir Leon de la Riva welcomed all the presents in the city, which "opened its doors, inspired by the spirit of solidarity."
HDS will choose the Chairman of the Presidency of the Presidency of the Commission by a general vote
On Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of the Christian Democracy Union (HDS) convention passed without problems for the Officer of the Angels Mercel, who is also the President of the Christian Democrat Party.
The future Property was not significantly planned in the programme, but it came to be a single east, in particular to satisfy the activists that believe that the government's policy is not as far as it should, today by Greece and may be to Italy tomorrow....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the Committee, which you are able to discuss, was almost agreed.
Only nine votes against and ten were rejected from the vote.
Agencies continued a few minutes, which deserved their expressions of Ang Mercel and a few hours later, Volfgang Shawble, Phil and Minister of Finance, have not left any place for doubts.
The basic idea of the officer and draft resolution is expressed in the lazing: the true response to the crisis is "not less, but more".
Not only because the world means, but because "new million slaves depend on it."
For the officer, "the time has come to pass in the Property."
This may mean changes in the Treaty of Lisbon that strengthen the control of the Union on the financial policy of the countries of the region, but that may also affect the elections of the President of the Commission by a general vote "to add a person".
In any case, it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Conference, which obviously belongs to Walfgang Shawble.
Of course, it is not likely that twenty-seven countries are quick to take this decision; the United Kingdom is against it, and the leaders of the HDS believe that Nikola Sarcosi is also against it.
But it's still ready.
In the same way, the delegates of the majority rejected the proposal to vote to each country, member of the Union in the Government of the Central Bank, with the size of the economy of each of them, that would notefully increase the weight of the German economy.
In order to satisfy the situation in her party, the officer increased the amount of the conference on the Adénuer and Helmuth Cola Congress, but she did not try to affect the conference on the " small" countries or countries in a heavy situation that would like to criticize "height" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on the whole paragraph is highlighted in the importance of " German and French friendship", Ang − Mercel did not have France.
It's just a middle.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig was a scene of blood battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliated disorders of the Napoleon Army.
What's the brain with the hospitals?
The UMP and the Government started the hospitals after the date-life.
On 15 November, Nicola Sarcosi will come to Bordo to visit the family facilities fund and to discuss this issue periodically raised since 2007 on the fight against the deficiency in the area of funds.
In order to help this deal from the desire to concentrate in a difficult situation, but also the part of the rights campaign for re-electing to the President, most people want to end on hospitals.
Firstly, as regards the budget economy, the Government intends to link private companies on the fourth day of unpaid payment before the start of the payment.
Obviously, without the consent of the employee, the sicker loses the payment for four days, at least 15 per cent of its monthly income.
Measure that threatens to cause anger, but which, according to Les Echos, leads to the economy of 280 million.
And which will be conducted by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to link public servants one day without payment for disease (the public servants had not been to wait for the payment of the benefits, other than the three-day expectation of the private sector).
Now, when these issues are discussed, the majority also re-enhance the subject of misuse in the transmission of hospitals.
The control will become more heavy and added, if you'll be able to return all the illegal payments you received," Ksavi Bertran warned on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
Like in other cases, the effect of the statement has been demonstrated incompatible with real use of hospitals.
They are actually subjected to continuous control and political attacks that bring their fruits.
The people in France are pained not more than anywhere else.
Let's first look at the numbers of the country.
According to the National Medical Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute of Research and Documentation of Health Economy, the daily compensation costs in 2008 were estimated by 11,3 million and 5% of the general health costs.
46 per cent of these amounts were decreased and accidents in production and 54 per cent to disease resources, consisting of 6,2 million.
Therefore, 2.5 per cent of the costs were made with health.
France had been conducted at a medium of 14,5 days in 2010, compared to 17,8 days in 2009, the Alma Consulting Group.
The average ariphmet that hides some refuses; the second study conducted by the Monster.com Carrier manager site in 2007 showed that 75 per cent of 40,000 deputed French scribes said that they had not taken any day of hospital.
Another study, this time, states that 37 per cent of hospitals were less than 8 days in 2010, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
If compare these numbers with the numbers of neighbours, it is evident that French chairmans are not more able to take a hospital than any other country.
The long investigation carried out by two CNRS researchers in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total deficiency in France (for health reasons or not) was treated between 10 and 11 per cent, compared to 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
A very low level of muscles with hospitals compared to "sero" occupation.
What's going on at the mosquito level, he's very low.
The lattership of the law after 2002 led to the system of control of hospitality over 45 days.
In 2008, from 1.5 million tested cases of CNAM, 13 per cent of 285.000 claims on short-term disease were "injustified" or too much, which contains 37.050 cases.
In the case of systemically checked hospitals, 11 per cent of cases of 1,2 million were "incompatible or unbased" for more than 45 days.
In general, 169 000 cases were "non-based" on several millions of people, and they received hospital letters.
The numbers that have a very few cases in comparison, for example, with the "sero" employment numbers.
According to the UMP Dominica Tiana Deputy, author of the report on this issue in June, they compose from 9 to 15 billion of budgetary income per year, which exceeds the total expenditure for daily compensations, and, therefore, unfinishedly above the loss of poverty.
Papadimos: Greece must follow the new regulatory plan
Greece needs a new regulatory programme to save its economy.
This stated on Monday 14 November, in the parliament of Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos, added that 100 days of its coalition Government were not sufficient to carry out this task.
"To achieve the objectives of safeguarding the economy, we are supporting our partners and the new budget correction programme," stated the Government chapter, who made its first public statement by opening a debate on easily confidence in the parliament in the environment.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the region of 27 October should be the "based task" of the new Government, since the presence of the country was " on the map" in the area, added.
As a result, Papadimos proposes to reduce the country's budget deficit "approximately 9 per cent" from UNDP to the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Rights reject the measures of the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the rights, gave its support to try out of the crisis, but he warned that his party would not support the additional measures of the strict economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at the meeting with deputats from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the tasks of reducing deficit and debt and combating the debt, but also the insufficientness of any course that prevents the reconstruction of the economy.
Ollie Rena, the Peace Commissioner, responsible for the economy and the warning that the MVF and the EU do not blow the credit of 80,000 million without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under the external pressure.
The Committee of Experts states that it is necessary to analyze evolution and suicide with external assistance
Canadians refuse to die, confirmed in the report of the Kingdom Society of Canada
The Committee assures that the Government, health and doctors work together in order to ensure the best paliative assistance, and that does not consider the cases of cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of the canadians are to tell their doctor when they want to die and to take steps in this direction.
This is one of the impressioning reports of the Kingsman of Canada, in which six experts were involved in different areas, including ethics, rights and medicals.
The Committee will allow the Government to amend a voting code to allow self-mord with external assistance and efficiency when this choice is related to circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to take such decisions.
For the beginning of the experts, the Economy of the Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is on 10th, the investigation notes that "the death medicalization in Canada has brought a culture in which people are afraid of death."
For medicalization or not, 77 per cent of the canadians have no access to paliative assistance, communities of experts designed by the Kingdom Society of Canada.
And 68.6 per cent of them end the death in the hospital.
The highest indicator of the country in Quebec, where 86 per cent are in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of Eutanasia and self-moord with external help, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the Code for Evtanasia and Suicide with external assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions were allocated or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization is a misuse in application, meaning that the evtanacy or self-sufficiency with external assistance to people who are not able or do not want to make such decisions.
Instead, he confirmed in the telecommunication of Joselin Duni, who reported, most of such cases were in countries where evtanase and self-motion with external assistance were not allocated.
The Eutanasia is in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
The suicide with external assistance is in Canada, where it is evidently illegal, explains Joselin Duni.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of the candidates were prosecuted by the Eutanasia, because, in 2010, they believe that it would allow people to facilitate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 per cent believe that the evolutionalisation would not be a sign that the life of older people or persons is less valuable.
As a result of those who have been helped in self-moord, 41 per cent of those who have been invited believe that they should not be pursued.
As a result of the prolongation or interruption of the health care, the situation is less unique, the report authors say.
In addition to their other recommendations, they have to state that the voting code should be established that legally legally interrupted medical income is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health experts learn in the spirit of respect for the refusal of health in the end of life without fear of a voting persecution.
The Committee calls the Government, the Medical Health Service Institutes and doctors to work together in order to deal with the best of the paliative assistance, not only in cases of cancer.
The end, regarding the paliative or terminal seat, already widthly applied in Canadian healthcare institutions, requires that it apply when it does not serve for the improving of the physical pain as the euthanasia, and has been subject to the same practices.
Notes of other experts
Experts in the field of the Law of Health have already been noted by the conclusion of the report of experts of the Kingdom Society of Canada.
Metr Peter Deshan, a specialist on health protection law, described as a "finity" position of experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it does not make use of evolution in cases.
This opens the door for the situation in which a person who has been raised from life and who is more than 18 years can ask for assistance in the conclusion of self-mord, Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metr Dessham also stressed that the authors of the report, such as Other prices of the identity, have been subject to the independence of the person above all other prices of society.
He said, "The community has a warning of signs and prohibitions."
Margaret Somerville also expressed "a category of non-release with the conclusions of the report, which she called "the Manufacturer of Evtanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Kingdom Society of Canada, has, in particular, discussed the reports relating to crimes in some countries where evtanasia and self-motion with external assistance as in the Netherlands and Oregone are allocated.

Damask condemns "contract"
Syria is most isolated
The Parties of Bashar Asad conducted a demonstrator yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Bashar Asad was strengthened yesterday, which, in support of Russia, opposes him and condemns "contract" against his country.

In its part, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglo, expressed a lack of the fact that the average efforts of Turkey, which began at the beginning of this year, did not have success.

By its part, the United States welcome the " extension of the consensus against Asad and the Syrian regime" followed by the Arab States and the Union ' s decisions.
The international community, the United States, the Union of the Arab States, the League of the Arab States and the countries such as Turkey, took a more heavy course for repressions in Syria, noted Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
At that time, 16 citizens and at least 19 representatives of the armed forces of the regime have died in the area of Dera in the south of Syria, reports the Syrian human rights observatory point (OSDH).

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France, Allen Juppee, also, was sent to the United Nations observators to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that, accordingly, was "paranoi".
The new emergency set of Liga was planned to discuss the outcome plan adopted on 2 November and, in particular, the outcome of armed forces from the cities where fighting goes and the release of arrested democrats.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Sergei Lavrov called "incorrect" solution to the Arab States Liga, while China invited Syria to carry out a crisis plan, but was detained from supporting the sanctions against Damascus.

Russian scientist Viceслав Danielenko helped Iran to repeat the detonator for the use of nuclear weapons confirmed the American agency specialized in the area of atomic dangers on Monday.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (MAGATA) and other UN Agency ' s documents are addressed to the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
MAGATE expressed anxiety in the last week of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to the ISIS, which was significantly responsible for MAGATE documents, Mr. Danielenko was born in 1934, worked 30 years, "the beginning of the sixty years, in the Soviet nuclear center in Chelabinska (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic exhibition methods."
In 1989 or 1991, he went out of the center to create an "nanoalmaze" company in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Employment in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia
In its report, MAGATE refers to "a clear sign that Iran's development of nuclear detonators" was "the work of an alien expert who did not only know this technology but who also reported to the Agency that he worked most of his career on this technology in the framework of the military nuclear programme of his country."
Anti-Sulman crimes increased by 50%
According to the Montenegro, the FBI statistics for 2009 to 2010 increased the number of anti-Sulman crimes by approximately 50 per cent, while other forms of violence on racial and religious poverty were lowly reduced or not.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslim increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which increased by 49 per cent, compared to 13 per cent of violence against Catholics, reduced by 4 per cent of Jewish attacks and increased by 14 per cent of religious crimes.
The total number of crimes for hatred, according to the FBI, increased very significantly to 6 628 cases, from which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent of religious differences.
After decreasing in 2009, the number of crimes would be again, underlined by Human Rights First, "the increase in cases of violence against Muslim ́o", adds: in the official message.
"Human Rights First has a long time highlighted that violence acts against Muslim, as well as all forms of crimes on the ground of hatred, should be considered as serious human rights violations," added one of the members of the organization of Pol Lejandr.
"American Government may and must do more to cope with these crimes, adding that it can be done by improving police reports on crimes on hatred."
"Federal Law of Owner's Occidence" I followed the period of combating civil rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Mar’s Luther King, to punish the acts of violence with race, color of skin, religion, nationality and in our days of sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its form and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site changed its form, which allows its users, in particular, to see the activity of those who follow what this service does like Facebook.
The new tab "activity" and the other "name" allows you to easier and directly monitor the activities of other "vectors", the Internet-processors whose message(s) you are following, and those who follow yours.
This provides the opportunity to disclose if they subscribe to new accounts if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "in a small percentage of users in August" before the outcome of a broad discipline on Monday, AFP stated to secret Twitter Caroline Penner.
Twitter, who was long-termly intuitively unconscious and used enough unexpected terms (RT to overcome some strange message, #followfriday to recommend other users), in particular by providing satisfaction to experienced users, opens itself to a larger auditorium, representing to users something closer to the popular Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the Internet, users discussed this new conversation using "twits" on the Internet.
"It's fucking, increasingly, and increasingly reminds Facebook."
Functional activity helps me better monitor certain elements of my flow in Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of ' gold rule ' of the budget
The great coalition of the social democrats and Christian democrats in Austria decided to write the "Guld Rule" budget on Monday to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid the possible reduction of the rating agencies of the State credit rating of Austria (troyal A).
Cancler social-democracy Verner Fayman has personally announced this decision at the end of the Minister ' s meeting, whereas the Austrian State holds 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the 60 per cent of the rule established by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the State holding of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's payment would only fall on one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to have a percentage of three thousand million more annually, bringing the argument of vice-concler and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Christian Democrats Michael Spindeleger.
As a result, Austria is complying with the request of the summit of the Member States of the region of 26 October in Brussels; the heads of States and Governments need to reduce budget deficits to the end of 2012 and return to balanced public accounts by constitution or equal law.
The establishment adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the " German model", since Germany was the first country of Peace that adopted this "reglement".
Before 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced to 0.75 per cent of the internal product (WWP), and since 2017 the structural deficit of the State's federal budget should not be exceeded by 0.35 per cent of the WTO, and the land, as well as the communities, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to impose the State's notes below 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty to 2020/2012.
Ezekiko Noda
threats the new intervention on the monetary market
Japan's Prime Minister Essichiko Noda warned on Monday that the Japanese authorities would take new interventions on the currency market if the value of yen would continue to grow.
We interfere with how we have done this last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the Ian exchange course, Mr. Nod Senatu explained.
On Tuesday, Iena grew nearly until the historical mark, which encouraged Japan to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold an ian for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new record of force since 1945.
However, with these couples of wines, they have grown up continuously undertaken by the purchases of investors who take it as a "refuge" in these troubled times of the world's economy fall and the crisis in the face of the world.
On Thursday, the dollar fell under 77 January, and it falled under the symbol of the plane in 105 January, near the level that led to the last intervention.
The 2008-2009 financial crisis was estimated about 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency causes Japanese export damage, since Japanese products are more deep and reduced by Japan’s income by the conversion to national currency.
"Japany fights to restore himself" after the 11 March and Sunamies, which deserted the region of Tohoku (North East), stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this growth will kill a huge repair.
The third world in the economic state renewed the growth in the third quarter - 1,5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - the first time a year - using the increase in export and the consumption of households, the loss of disasters
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect the "fundamental economic indicators of Japan".
The Ministry of Finance Djun Adzumi invited the Japanese Bank (BoJ), which opened on Monetary Policy two days on Monetary Council on Monetary Policy on Monetary Affairs on Monday.
However, the Governing Board of Hirohide Jamaguti warned that the Japanese Bank had already adopted " the corresponding steps" to understand that there was no additional weight in the environment to be expected.
At the last meeting on the end of October, the increased by 5.000 million Ien (47.000 million) of Casine obligations, raised up to 55.000 million Ien (519.000 million) of the amounts that it has provided for for the purchasing of various financial instruments in order to settle the market in values.
Region
rates, fund boards are covered
The risk of impairment by debt crisis supports Peace indexes.
Despite the designation of new heads of the States in Greece and Italy and improved growth indicators in France and Germany, taxes in non-stable countries continue to grow
The still safe stability of the zone, the Peeis boards went on Thursday, 15 November, a little further in the negative zone.
In Paris, on 10th morning, CAC 40 lost 1.4% and ended the markets at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell to 0.4% and London to 0.1%.
With regard to new difficulties with the payment of credit by countries in a difficult situation, the funding markets worldwide continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"Investors are just too concerned about the risk of infringement," explains Terry Prae, the institutional IG Markets broker, quoted by Re.
The Tokyo bargai has been closed by 0.7 per cent under new doubts of the market participants on the ability to maintain a debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has stressed its view of Property, and the barges will follow each other in the lack of changes until investors will be understood that the situation of stability is," Micusigue Akino, the fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management states
This return of anxiety on the future zone will be broken by one currency that continued to fall on Thursday.
He reached his lower note in half months.
At the 10th morning, the currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, falling to 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she fell on Monday after the arrival of the officer of the Officer of the Officer of Mercel HDS, on which a resolution was adopted, in particular, for the countries in the complex position, to leave the zone without abandoning the Union.
Italian and Spanish rates above 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level that causes great threats.
Today, on Monday, the income of the 10-year-old 10-year commitments reached 6,85 per cent, and the income of Spanish obligations at the same time reached 6,2 per cent.
These complexities with percentage rates in Southern countries, but also in France, continue to encourage the concerns of participants.
The chapter of the future Italian Government, Mario Monty, requested a period of time to restore the situation in Italy under the threat of the parallel under its weight.
The new Prime Minister of Greece Lucas Papadimos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the Zone of 27 October would be the "based task" of his Government.
Spain on the markets' shot before parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Dutch and Spain have reached a new historical ma'am in front of the 10-year debt rates.
In expectation of growth in the area
France’s risk of economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, a little better than 0.3 per cent expected, grasping the increased consumption of households.
Insee, despite this, reviewed the second quarter's number reduction by 0.1 per cent of the internal product (BDP) instead of stagnation.
And the economy's most fear of the fourth quarter.
Germany, in its part, increased by 0.5% for the same period.
The first rate for the entire zone is expected at 11th morning, and the Commission warns the danger of the new recession.
Energy policy:
Factors must be overcome the dogs
If there is a subject to the decision to take after continuous discussions or emotional effects, it is a energy policy.
Energy accessibility and valuation are directly concerned about the ability and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that you choose the meetings become a result of thinking about nuclear energy.
It will not bring fruit until all economic, environmental and economic consequences of the proposed options will be studied.
France should build its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
Now we are 70,000 million people on the planet, the demographic development will double electricity needs until 2050, if only a large part of the world's population will be kept in life.
During the same period, the increased deficiency of resources will be made to continue the production of electricity, without forgetting the most important need for reducing emissions of gases in order to address the climate disbalance theme that has disappeared from environmental debates.
Fucusim's awareness doesn't change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which puts its decision depending on the need to find a source that is able to replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which is intended to build only the most modern reactions.
On the other hand, Greece, Finland, Poland, Czechland, Netherlands, Sweden, Southern Action, China, India, Brazil are only few of those who are resolving to continue their projects.
The United States decided to add one installation to their compact by rebuilding the construction of the aerodrome, which was interrupted after the aerodrome in the Trimeale Island.
Although Germany’s model for renewable energy sometimes leads to an example, it is actually contrary to this argument.
Berlin's choice will have an increase in electricity value, an increased energy dependency, an increased need in imported gas, in particular Russia's emissions in gas oxide for gas-building.
For a few months, all these inappropriate effects will already be felt.
We should consider the example of Denmark.
The Champion is a turbine building from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, and it is the largest carbon and gas consumer due to the wind's interruption; it is why emissions of oxygen gas and electricity prices corresponding to 65 per cent and 50 per cent above in the average.
On the other hand, thanks to the continuity of our political energy, our neighbors will have 40% more electricity than French households.
Since the global energy price is the key factor of competitiveness and the service of industrial equipment on the national territory, the French companies benefit from the most profitable electricity in the country.
Consequently, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a large increase in electricity value, which will make illustrate beautiful statements on our country's new industrialisation and the protection of the purchase of ability.
The price that most French people refuse to make is more than because they do not act in principle against this type of energy.
It should be remembered that the energy policy of the country has made a growth of industry in 125 000 first slaves and 410 000 employees.
It is strongly oriented to export, and it attaches the whole range of specialized in the international trade of small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many slaves that cannot be moved into another growth.
If France had decided to refuse from nuclear energy, it would have to have a large number of these enterprises and to lose 6 thousand million per year from the French nuclear and services export.
What electrical engineer will order the EPR calculated to work sixty years if the closure of its manufacturer is planned?
In order to resolve the equation of energy, it should be admitted that there are no divine or devil sources of energy production.
Once the Areva company has low gas emissions , nuclear and renewable solutions , it is evident that energy sources are integrated.
For nuclear energy supporting the highest safety level is uncertainly an important issue of life
In France, we have a security body which provides an uncomprehensive and transparent control of energy centres such as Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionalism is recognised are full of the same security.
For 50 years, the atom industry survived three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, has occurred in normal conditions of exploitation, but without any consequences for human or environmental environment
In Chernobla, the reaction device and the indirect error led to tragedy.
In Fukusim, some people forget that the accident has occurred with two natural disasters of unprecedented force, which have caused decades of thousands of people to die.
The nuclear growth is learning from this avenue, as it was drawn out from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between security bodies, operators and French and German co-operators, EPR, represents a project that allows to resist such manifestations.
Since it is considered to be all energy specialists who want to build a reacter, the rest of its building in Flamanville will be a great gift to the Areva and EDF competitors, making them clear the way to enhance leadership in the inevitable development of atomic energy.
It is necessary and legally to look for the best energy sources for our country, but it would be unresponsibility to allow emotions, dogs and predicted manuals to get in a situation that is so important for our country's economic, economy and financial situation.
Immigration is a burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy in Nikola Sarcosi has been criticized from various parties - the transfer of police, judicial and administrative services under digital policies and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as " human rights government".
Thereafter, the administrative pressure of foreign students was made in the issue of news, when the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Liberasson of 23 May) stated that France "not needs for foreign talents, stones and officers."
But it is very rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
Right and left in this issue are many.
The right tone was assigned to Jacques Shirakam, which in 1976 stated that "900 000 without Property would not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign slaves", but on the left, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France could "not take the poor from the world."
Difference only at the level of kindness
In 2005, the police water leaders felt the right and the left of the country's fear of the incoming to the territory.
Both parties see the immigration of the prejudice for the French economy and for the French society.
The difference is only at the level of charity that they will allow to show to immigrants.
In its programme, France Oland was acquired of banalities, saying that "the joint work will allow the issue of immigration."
This presentation of immigration as a pregnancy and the problem can give electoral advantage, but the economic value is very valuable.
As Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron are reminded of us in the recent book that reported the recent immigration data (Personal people: As a migration of our world's form and to determine our future, May 2011, the Edition of the Princeton University, 352 C.E.), there is a wide consensus among specialists on the effect of the local impact of migration flows on economic growth, the ability and occupation of countries that take immigrants.
The limitation of immigration is to weak growth and decreases the employment.
The fear of the immigrants is to imagine that they are able to replace the low-qualificated persons, especially by providing a reduction of payments.
However, experience shows that immigrants actually are much more added than to replace the slave force to perform work that does not suffice for a slave of force.
Non-qualified immigrants work in sectors that have not affected the slave force, and the most qualified are in dynamic sectors where education is not with the proposals of work.
Positive impact on payment
Similarly, as the surgery would be difficult to work in the country where there is no anestesiologists, interim compliance between immigrants and immigrants, it would lead to the impact of immigrants.
Johnny Peri recalled that the increase in 1% of the migration flow would increase by 0.6 to 0.9 per cent of real long-term payments.
And it is without prejudice that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (in the United States Lauriers of Nobel Prince, a large part of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo, all were immigrants).
The migrants also bring a clean arrival to the security system by giving the average 1% of the general budgets of the countries of Peace.
By evaluation of the World Working Organization, for example, in Germany, the immigrant in age of 30 years, will bring its lives to the public budget a pure income (income) in average of 150 000.
Nicola Sarcosi at the beginning of his mandate was going to get into the deficiencies of growth.
The teeth that has been spent to fear the immigrants have made an equivalent effect.
Democracy has been acquired and remains to reflect Peace democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time and cruel.
The continent must remember that, in Athena more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century he survived the Tragedy of the I World War, the Toalitary regimes, Holocaust, Gulag, as well as France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
They believed that the democracy would be careful for its responsibility to establish sufficient vote and make it as much as possible.
From the time of Napoleon, "My" is what this happens from the overall thoughts.
The universal vote, although it is a obligatory democracy, is not sufficient and may even become "and a deterioration" as said by the philosof-resp’an Athen Washington.
No, the democracy also requires a lot of other public space, public spirit, prices, organizations, divisions and controls of authorities, education, economic and solidarity, justice.
If we are concerned, the crisis is economic crisis, but in the first place it is a political crisis and democracy crisis.
In this regard, the Palynode of the true Greek referencement will have a double effect, demonstrating the need for serious political changes and an inappropriate feeling of its incompatibleness and incompatibleness.
This doubleness must be considered to overcome it.
It is that the leading line for democracy has now been moved and, in many cases, the Response soldiers are now not on the other side.
We will not win anything by requireing a series of national references organized in terms of appreciation and haoth order.
"Cart-Blansh" for the absolute Mona of Peace or a ship with the feet of the loss of nationalism - what choice for a citizen!
No, we are not talking about gilithine's lease, but about the common, clear and incompatible, election and democracy, this time at the general level.
There are no crisiss in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and there are only one crisis: the crisis.
All of the markets and rating agencies are subject to the dictature, suffers from its ability and from the lack of solidarity.
Everyone has been low on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of the sovereignty, but all of them are gradually lost its sovereignty, and together with it each of its nations.
It must be urgently restored to the project of Peace under national sovereignty.
Since only the joint agencies are able to reduce the debt of each, free from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The outcome of the crisis needs decisions at the general level and they cannot be taken without a full democracy without bringing us to a disaster.
After long discussion of this proposal, the socialists and Jacques Delor are still required by the Peace Economic Government.
Let's go.
But to imagine itself without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which is in the lives of grass, it is an extreme foolish and new stupid.
We must start a new stage of building.
In order to establish the resistance in France, it was necessary to "create" the resistance.
Revolution of interests would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains in power.
We need to build the same at the economic level.
This can only be made by creating more democracy than at the political level, the present national sovereignty of Peace.
In order to create a person, let's create a piece.
The uncontracted chips are spread increasingly.
The World Card Exposure is opened on Thursday in Vilpente under Paris in the optimism atmosphere.
In fact, in 2011, 11% of the worldwide sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM card phones) will be overall, according to Eurosmart, 60,000 million units.
The most important sector of uncontakt technology that allows public transport or purchases to be paid by simply conducting a map over the calculating device.
This year, 460 million uncontakt chip cards will be sold against 320 million years ago!
Their share grows in 2012 (waiting 580 million units) and consists of approximately 10 per cent of the world market of Chip Card (6.925 million cards).
A long time left from the Asia and the Pacific region is now moved in the area of uncontakt.
Approximately 26 million bank cards of Visa have already been acquired of this function, and they have 75,000 terminals.
France starts with smaller places: There are 400,000 uncontakt cards of Visa.
But big magazines produce that.
In this year, Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontakt Pass MasterCard.
To go to a higher speed, banks need to get out of their customers' equipment.
"The two large organizations in France have promised systematic distribution of bank cards available to uncontakt use in the future among their clients," reported Gerar Nebui, Director-General Visa Europe France.
The banks test payments using a phone.
But it's just the first stage of the future payment means, that's a phone.
Until only a few equipment are equipped with NFC technology (communication of the nearby field) necessary to conclude such transactions.
"They were rejected.
"But they must actually fly in the year."
"We consider world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, chapter Eurosmart.
But the banks are going forward.
Crédit Agricole yesterday announced the experiment from December to June in Canada.
iPhone devices will be acquired of approximately 200 clients and holders with clusters which provide uncontakt payments.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and in Marshall.
Societé General also stated that he was preparing the market of a proposal that allowed his clients to carry out the phone cells.
The terrorist front is distributed from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is in peace with the Islamic Magrib's relations with the Sect Boko Haram.
A long time have been confirmed connections between the terrorist of the Al-Qaida Group in Muslim Magribe (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Section of Boko Haram.
On Monday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria Abdelcader said even that the Algerian are now sure.
"Sp, which uses these two organizations, and secret services reports that they are actively cooperating," he explained without detail.
Paris, it came to a similar outcome.
In January, the study of two francs in Nigeria was discovered by two wallets.
The people who were buried in the restaurant in Niamea close to Aqmi, Antuan de Leocur and Vensan Delory were seemed to be killed on a day with a few of the hosts during the operation conducted by French speed divisions.
In the midst of the clouds, after operation, French and Nigerian surveys found several phone cards, belonging to terrorists.
There's a terror.
Analysis of the name of the sound place indicated several meetings in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), researchers are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates the niger who has long lived in Magigur, the city of North Nigeria, the Boko Haram collives, and the other is a man, as it is approved, close to Aqmi and Sect.
"This is the step forward, but, of course, it must be expected more reliable evidence than talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
"For many years, the sect has received financial and ideal support outside and that it becomes more and more active," says the Nigerian research Conle Amuvo.
In the past months, this support has become more evident on the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of the stakeholders and the more complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community in the Chapter of Washington now presses Abuju to focus on the problems created by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have considered this group traditionally as a community of people who are not interested.
Quick Success
In 2002, based in Majdigury at Mohammed Jusuf, Boko Haram - which means "West Education is sin" - preachs the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in the north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, there was quick success.
It is political and requires a close respect for the chariation, and its activists have started to fight against the wicked central government.
It is primarily affected by the Church, the bars and the authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists showed an intense activity by making numerous attacks on the police.
Abbudge's reaction, as usually, is uncompromissive.
The army of the city's block left 800 dead after it.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in the morning.
The sect is now radicalised and get out of its northern vessels.
In the past Birthday, she took responsibility for an action, which resulted in killing 80 people in Jose, and then for another in Abuge.
In June, Abuge Boko Haram organized the first attack of the police officer.
In August, the representative of the United Nations will become their first international goal.
The axis of terrorists in Mauritania through Nigeria in Somali are now afraid of all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi strengthened in Mali and Nigeria and the Somalians from Al-Shabaab are in Kenya, Boko Haram represents a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during the conversation with President Gudlah Jonathan Allan Jupe warned about the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed the preparation to share all the inflation.
The world, as the President's candidates see him
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mi Romani, Herman Caine and Rick Perry are simplified and incompatible.
Can the depressed crisis of America lead to a complex world by means of simple and more simplic ideas?
If you listen to the candidates in the president of the Republic, the electors could believe that.
A few days have we Romany, Herman Caine, Rick Perry and others have been sound, but the details of the external policy which are traditionally a strong part of the reprehensives.
Lozing, China, Iran, and Israel’s help, are often mixed.
We are Romany, whose best opportunities for the exhibition of the "And Good Party" were threatened to give the Chinese complaint in the WTO and to accuse them in "manipulation of its currency is a sensitive issue for America, which was devastated by the migration of all its industrial growth in Asia.
It's worse if it leads to trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, the former Employment of Obama in China and the only candidate who understands a complex external policy, had not been able to fight the position that affects emotions.
He invited the strong but active dialogue with Pekin (the present position of Obama).
But the Huntsman, holding in the bottom of the rating, remained unhearted.
In Reagan's style
Romany also promised military attacks on Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I'll restore Iran," he said."
"If Obama is reelected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance by accusing Obama to not comply with the promises of this partner.
Let's take hold of Herman Kane, the second in the review of candidates, a demonstrator of disturbing ignorance of matters.
He recently called to oppose Chinese military threats because Pekin tries to get nuclear power - obviously, without knowing that China has already managed her since 1964!
The Governor of Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks in Iran, says that it is ready to use and use the American army in Me Mémékee against drugs.
To flee to the torture of suspicious in the terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009, also recommended Cain, Perry and Michel Bachman candidate.
All this is very far from the Response candidate in 2008, John Cain, a weight of external policy.
The opposers of the present President replied that Reagan had a simple idea and that he had won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a loversman and that he had to reduce the tone in the fight against terror.
They are rightly insisting on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the preliminary conclusion of " guys" from Iraq, his captives in Libya, who brought him a reputation of policy.
But it's not so easy.
The population considers the local balance of national security in Obama, which is eliminated by Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it doesn't believe in military interventions that are involved in the song.
And, claiming that America needs to restructure economics to restore its leadership, Obama rights.
North Flood, new gates for Russian Gas incoming inside.
Gas management of the North River, which councils the Western and Russia's pressure on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is launched.
It was calculated for the equivalent gas of 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russian gigantic gas manufacturer, wanted to clear this event with pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of States and Governments, have participated in the last Thursday on the Baltics, between the expression of orchestra and the inquiry, in the opening of the North River, the new gas management, which is intended to join Russia and Germany under water.
Cancler of Germany Ang; Mercel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fion and his netherlands colleague Mart Rutte, together returned a symbolic ventilation that controls the income of Russian gas in the west of the network.
By the new gas management, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will be made to the Western Property on the first roof of 1.224 km, which consists of the Leningrad area with the land of McLenburg-Pomerania.
The second tube was to be prepared at the end of 2012 by providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third tube is already discussed in the same direction.
For Gazprom, the timely end of this large project is a victory.
The project met the opposite opposition of Poland and the Pribaltic States.
North Flood will actually allow gas to be directly in Germany, avoiding transition through the third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries lose part of their authority: they will be more difficult to affect Russia by threatening the access to the western markets.
At the most stressed time, Warshawa debates did not stop before comparing the North River with the new " German-Sweet Pacte" with the aim of occupating Poland in 1939.
This means that the political issue is sensitive.
With the support of this Russian project, the Western Security of its provisions is more safe.
However, the price of the presence of energy is because the project has created a barrier between the east and the west.
Russia has succeeded less than five years of understanding of the direct Union between Russia and the rich west countries that consume large gas and their own stocks.
"This gas leader is a part of cooperation with Russia, the new artery that organically relates to us," said France Fion, opening the gas management, demonstrating how important and political and economic gas contracts are.
All this explains the large smiles of the Chapter of Gazprom, the presence of a large quantity in Lumina, the coming points of gas.
The construction of this gas is also a technical trend.
The subcutaneous tube was made of the stone captured in the beton to protect it from the ships.
He's at the bottom of the sea, at the average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, the mining fields remained from the Second World War were required.
"The hundred had to be removed or made as a warning," said Yens Muller, the press secretary of the North Pound.
It was also necessary to take a lot of steps to protect fauna and floor.
The trumpet is a long metal dragon, a weight of 242 Ephesian bags, without breaking throughout its length, without ventilation, and without service.
Contrôle Property was planned in the area of Sweden, but the governing project was rejected because Sweden was not concerned that the Russian State Agency would be inhabited forever at its own.
"In the case of an appeal, we'll cut the gas flow less than in a minute," says Jans Muller.
So, in the case of the gas escape contained in the gas carrier, the air is.
But this is a smaller probability of co-capacity, which is the project of swimming, calculated only for 100,000 years.
The control of the gas control will be on the subwater robot that drives the ship for external monitoring, as well as the equipment that circles within the gas carrier.
The cigarographic device is introduced within the tube of a diameter of 1 meter and is protagonized in front of the gas flow.
After three full days of travel, he provides exact information about any metal delay.
The gas management was designed for work for 50 years without the need for smaller reparation.
The gas surrounding is only due to its pressure.
It includes 200 bars when sending and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies have joined efforts to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of capital.
The rest is the German company E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies created a joint company called the North River, which was ordered to build and exploit gas management.
His apartment is located in Cuga in Switzerland, where the tax is especially pleasant.
Gazprom then delivered this company to a garment for twenty years with the possibility of extending the total gas transport volume.
"Gasprom will take a full amount, independent of what quantity of gases will actually be transported," says Jans Muller.
The financing of gas management was provided by 30 per cent of shareholders and by 70 per cent of bank credits.
The total value of 日 consists of 7.40,000 million for two tubes.
GDF Suez investments will be about 240 million.
But Minorists are sure that they will purchase their debt because Gazprom has all risks.
The gas drive comes from the Baltic Sea in Luminos to a rubber rubber rubber.
The ventilation of 4,5 metres high is a gas output terminal.
Dutchs measure pressure, temperature and specific characteristics before transporting it into German gas vehicles.
From the past Thursday, the terminal gets one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Bridge block
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will return the cuss to the writing.
He has an aroma of accommodations, hours performed in the light of the light.
The Moleskine block is easy to find out on the rectangle black area, on the rain, on the yellow-white pages, like wishes with time.
However, the book of Moleskine, as we know today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo company decided to launch designer blocks to sell.
Maria Sebregondi, the current adviser of the company, took responsibility for a new product.
The block is inspired by an old manufacturing technology, a molecularly locked boyfriend with a tissue, such as for the cover of stomach.
This type of blocks highly appreciates the writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought the old and forgotten thing that was cultural for artists-Avangardists to the 20th century," race Mary Sebregondi, who has become a manager in Modo Modo.
I've done it.
Since 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million.
We left far from the production of the first years when only 3000 blocks were produced.
Moleskine passed the border of Italy and was exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
The identity of the typical purchaser is difficult because the block is equally attached to businessmen, students and free professionals.
Moleskine buyers are spacepolitical, have large views and education.
The small Italian company, which first had only 12, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and another in New York.
It extends its blocks in the Fnac book stores, small towns centres, and has a wide range.
"We follow the spirit of time and this new need in writing, despite the presentation of the e-mail," explains Mary Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural chart leads to the development of Moleskine; the border has recently organized the "Environmental Road", where the artists and artists have demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also launched the layers with leopards on the case of a film in Locarno.
Following its success and cultural air, Moleskine has differentiated its products, which now include bottles, hands, computer bags. Brand includes all types of support.
Success that brought dependence: August 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, who wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the department of the invalents so high?
Approximately 19 per cent of persons are looking for.
The 15th week of employee is beginning today.
Despite the public prosperity policy beginning in 2005, the share of non-invalents remains twice above, which is 19 per cent against 9 per cent of the total population.
Is he disgusting?
"No, it underlines Eric Blanche, Director-General Adapt, a organization that organizes the week of the work of persons."
"There will be a significant progress for 15 years."
"In that time, the department was not at 2, but three times more."
"It's a lot of work at the same time."
It must be said that there is a lot more for the invalidity of impairment in the work.
In the middle of them, 37 per cent of older than 50 years (17 per cent in average).
They have a lower quantity level: 80 per cent have no bacalawry levels, but from 2.3 million students in higher education only 10 000 persons.
The end is very deeply distributed without a rubber, which consists of 85 per cent of the invalents against 38 per cent in the average.
Shortly, all these criteria that are very difficult to return to and which are a problem," said Christian Grapen, Director-General Tremplin, of the associations created in 1992 to help firms taking a disabilities.
There are some of the threats.
There is no need to talk about mentality that changes, but too long.
The investigation carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprise association by the Cité order showed that the requested managers had a low level of knowledge of the invalidity and "presented themselves to appeal or mentally incomplete people".
Results are private companies with more than 20 persons still far from the aim of 6 per cent of the invalents laid down in the Act adopted in 1987.
The last numbers related to 2008 are 2.5%.
"We are approximately 3%," says Peter Blan, Director-General Agefiph, organization responsible for the collection of taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Proof: The number of "subsidy" organisations as well as the amounts paid was reduced in 2007-2011 from 59.000 to 46.000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million).
"The Law of 2005, which raised the tax, has made a strong pressure on the company," explains Peter Blan."
"But this improvement also reflects increasing consciousness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to the Department of Employment, only 59 per cent of agencies with a number of 20 to 49 have invalents against 82 per cent of agencies with 100 to 199.
Azar: "What's the happiness"
Before fighting Cynny on Thursday (20:45 p.m.) Eden Azar and George Leekens didn't hide the pleasure they received from this friendship.
We're not going to say that there was a secret talk between them, but a figurative image.
Seating near the tribe of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar were peaceful.
Five months later, the Belgian trainer can only praise him.
"I am very pleased by Eden, his movement and the fact that he is belgian."
"I want to go further," assured the player of Lila.
The fact that until the contrast between its achievements in the club and the collection, it's just one thing, it's justified.
"I'm in Lila a round year, and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to work the points."
The one left in the reservation, in front of this gate with France, in the game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar came to Saint-Denna to "blast" the end.
Not forgetting, however, the understanding of "duality".
He supported the Blanch since the age of 7 years and the winning campaigns 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the character of this master.
And especially what is on the other side of the Mother, Johann, and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"Only our ways have been crossed."
"The possibility to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens remembered the "groundness".
"Grootness" to play in the "speaking mad."
"State" also claims as a "neighbor" that France has become a very high-level team for a year after the traumatism in Nizne.
"Loran Blan was like a shot of a sound, he's awake.
Now, when Belgium is going to pass the §ro, the technical sportsman will fly in one aircraft with the white leadership... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians will," he stressed.
"We're building something, players of ambassadors, they're hungry."
"You're convinced that it's in future murders, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident in itself
Portuguese Paul Bentu starts its responsible murder against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) on Thursday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both team seemed to have lost the feeling of reality.
"To the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and the most important, happy country."
Paulo Bentu has seen himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that the Collect, which has its role since September 2010, is qualified for 2012.
Portugal only in 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday in Zennica's hair, it's clear that the game is not able.
Although Portuguese Dominica was in a house for more hours, she could not achieve the aim of the covenant that would satisfy her.
"This is a good result that, however, is a certain risk."
But at their light stadium de la Luces in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will go through, in the sight of the p.a., which must be in a care, although the math will be very pressured," said the optimistic, but the discreet Bentu.
"We're expecting a very stressed murder, but we're sure we can win," said the 42-year Portuguese trainer.
"We still have 50 per cent of the chances to be held in 2012," Mr Carlusha Cairosh said.
On Friday, no one in a bitch against Bosnia requires a portugais winning.
No one could build boss.
"This is a good result in which, however, some risks, is sorry for Bentu.
"We will play against a team with many technical values and players of many individual dignity," he added.
As it was in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to make a maximum pressure on the basin from the beginning, "not give them time to think."
It's a good idea, just this time she'd be about it.
