about how long are these symptoms present?
and all pains in the breast cell should be treated in this way, especially with regard to your age
and with high temperature
and also needs to check the levels of your cholesterine and artificial pressure
And have you a high temperature now?
And are you trying this pain in the breast cell now?
And is it difficult for you to breathe?
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides these?
And how high was your temperature!
And I've got it.
And I've got a little prostitute with I'll.
And I have a really strong pain today in the breast cell.
And whether this is the time for the appearance of a dream which you are approved.
and cause pain in the breast cell
And I think I had a little temperature.
And I want you to describe what the breast cell you're experienced.
And they also have a little high temperature
and with your history of diabetes
And you know, it feels like my breast will be cut off.
And you know, people keep on me.
and you're suffering in the breast cell
And you said that this is the pressure in the breast cell.
Someone in the family has problems with heart, heart delay, myocard infarct, high level of cholesterine, high artificial pressure
Any other symptoms or problems noted by you and with muscle pain?
Do you have other houses, because you have the same symptoms?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you trying to search now?
Do you still try pain in the breast cell
Because it's the grip season.
but we should also not be careless because of the pain in the breast cell with a cardiac nature
However, the more important problem is this pain in the breast cell
But I have a hard spirit.
But I know a lot of people's going on to me.
but we need to treat any pain in the breast cell with the maximum seriousness
But you're breathing well now, right?
'Cause I don't remember this pain in the breast cell
It seems like someone's throwing your breast cell.
You still feel a fucking look.
Do they grieve for the symptoms of bad self - feeling?
Do you have any other chronic diseases such as high art pressure or something similar?
Do you have any other chronic diseases or medical problems such as diabetes?
Are you trying to look at this pain in the breast cell?
Do you have high artificial pressure?
Do you have this covering?
Do you know what the symptoms she had?
Do you see this picture?
Drink a lot of kidneys today
But I'm going through the tests on the diabetes.
But she had the symptoms exactly as I had.
How high is your temperature?
What is your artificial pressure?
if you still have a high temperature
if you have a temperature of thirty-eight or nine or above
if you think your symptoms or problems guarantees the improvement of external aspects
I had the temperature yesterday.
I had a little temperature yesterday.
I had temperature yesterday.
I'm trying here in the breast cell, I'm cutting pain.
I also have a little troubled breath.
I'll send you a picture.
I'm trying some pain in the breast today.
I have a little illness today and the temperature has risen.
I think it's a grip.
I think it's a grip in a easy form.
Remembers this, as if a very hard person is sitting on your head?
All of this began almost simultaneously with pain and temperature increase
I'm trying a pain in the middle of the breast.
It's like pain in the breast cell.
It's in my breast.
It's in the center of my breast cell.
It's in the center of the grass cell.
I had a pain in my breast.
I'm very worried about this pain in my breast.
I want you to describe this pain in my breast.
as high artificial pressure or diabetes
exactly in the center of the grass cell
from high temperature you can now take tahipirin in the form of ice
And now, Mary, tell me how many days you have shown these symptoms.
Now you said you felt pain in your breast
I feel a little pain in my breast.
Well, if you have any other symptoms other than pain.
Or someone sits on your breast?
Exactly the same high temperature and the high temperature, muscle and muscle pain
pain directly in the center of my breast
Show me on this image where you feel pain.
Because you have a high temperature
So you think some of these symptoms could be able to be able to be disciplined?
So, your children have some of these same symptoms?
Tell me about your pain in the breast cell
The temperature increases tonight
The temperature I had last two days
The temperature began to increase last night
This is Dr. Porter in the acceptable room of aid
Okay, can you tell a little more about your breast pain?
Well, I feel pain in front of my body, here, in the breast.
Well, I feel a pain in the breast.
So when I feel pain in my breast
What kind of pain do you feel in your breast?
When did you start feel that pain in your breast?
Where exactly are you feeling pain in your breast?
Where you just feel this pain in your breast
You're trying something like the feeling of your breast.
You know, I have a diabetes and all that.
You said you tried this pain in the breast cell
Quickly-qualtiful indicator of coronaviral infection (COVID-19) in the Union and in the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The competitive illness of the coronaviral infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in countries of Rose / Property of the Economic Zone and in the United Kingdom, confirming that, despite the different situation of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemia grows closely in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy needs to increase the level of preparation for patients with COVID-19 needed to be treated and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, Uhan of the Chinese province of Hubai was fixed a number of cases of non-theological diseases.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese control and profile of diseases reported that the infectioner is a new species of coronavirus, currently being a coronavir of a severe severe respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since this time, the SARS-CoV-2 disease was called Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available today, some 80 per cent of COVID-19 diseases are seen in a light form, e.g. in the form of respiratory infections with or without penemony, most of them are healthy.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases are developed in a severe form of hospitalisation, and the rest of 6 per cent is critical when intensive treatment is required.
The level of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 consists of approximately 4 %.
The study examines the trends of cumulative disease COVID-19 in each country of the Union (EU) and the Economic Zone (EEE) and in Greece, and their comparison with the trends in the China Province of Hubai.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 diseases in the EU/EEC and in the United Kingdom with Italy data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEE and United Kingdom
COVID-19 has been extended to other countries, and in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 is currently developing the same dynamic as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemia.
In the Eurosurveillance journal of 5 March 2020, Mr. Species (Spiteri) and its colleagues reported the first sub-quality cases of COVID-19 disease in which the WHO was responsible to the criteria for which the disease was defined.
The first three subsequent cases in the EU/EEC were registered in France on 24 January 2020 — all three pains returned from Uhana of the Chinese province of Hubai.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 infection were detected in all 30 EU/EEC countries and in Greece, whereas 39 768 infection cases were fixed from 31 December 2019 to that date, and 1 727 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease COVID-19
• The ECDC control and profile of diseases each day at 8:00 updates data on the number of cases registered in COVID-19 in each country of the world received from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of these countries, national and regional authorities.
These data are used to analyze the COVID-19 distribution trends in the EU/EEE and in the United Kingdom and to compare their data in Italy.
As an indicator of the expansion of the active cases of COVID-19, the comprehensive cumulative illness of COVID-19 was considered in 14 days, taking into account the normal flow of COVID-19 in each EU/EEE and in the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also made the cumulate number of cases fixed in each country at 8:00, 15 March 2020, compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in EU/EEE countries and United Kingdom
The COVID-19 development trends for the 14-day period of the EU/EEE countries and in the United Kingdom were in general compliance with the trends observed in the Chinese Province of Hubai (section 1).
COVID-19 in the EU/EEE and in the United Kingdom has grown around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 a rare score of this indicator (additional material).
This was primarily stated by the streaming of the number of cases registered in Italy, but in all other countries of the EU/EEE and in the United Kingdom, similar trends were observed to increase cumulative disease COVID-19 (additional material).
The number of cases of COVID-19 disease in EU/EEE countries and in Greece in comparison with the similar indicator for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this, the total number of cases already registered at 8:00, 15 March in 15 other EU/EEC countries and in Greece, compared to the numbers fixed in Italy only 3 weeks ago.
Our results testify the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases registered in the EU/EEE and in the United Kingdom.
The COVID-19 cumulative disease trends are allowed to assume that the pandemia is developed with a comparable speed in all countries.
This is, despite the differences in the various countries, the difference between the response taken by the national public health authorities, and may be different criteria for the recognition of disease and the selection of patients for the analysis of COVID-19, including the "convergence" test.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors in the regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive therapy, and the MME noted that hospitals and intensive therapy in these regions had been maximally filled.
The data of the COVID-19 disease in the hospital and (or) intensive treatment in the EU/EEE are available only for 6% and 1% of the cases (no data are presented).
However, a systematic collection of such information is necessary to comply with the current monitoring data that includes the number of registered cases and the quantity of assets.
According to the results of the study carried out in 2010-2011, a significant dilution of cokes is observed in the intensive treatment and intensive incidence of diseases: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 cooks for 100.000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 kitchens in intensive therapy and intensive incidence for 100.000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the risk assessment of COVID-19 risk modeling of health resources with evaluation data on hospitalization of COVID-19 in each EU/EEE and in the United Kingdom, where the risk of lack of accessible cokes in intensive therapy increases 90 %.
Since the case is currently grouped by certain EU/EEA and British regions, and hospitals and intensive therapy are usually serving the population of a certain territory group, information on cases of infection and quantity of cokes in intensive therapy is recommended to provide at the level 2 of the Territory Units nomenclature for statistics (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries are that the COVID-19 Pandemia is intensely developed in the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy should be prepared for the SARRS-CoV-2 contact infection, which is unpleasant for long-term, and to increase the number of patients with COVID-19, needs medical assistance and, in particular, intensive therapy, which, for example, can be observed in the loss of the regions of Italy.
As reported in the last report of the ECDC on the results of the risk assessment, an important importance for the maintenance of SARS-COV-2 distribution has an operational, promoting and comprehensive approach to the follow-up of the reduction of the impacts, since, taking into account the predicted streaming increase in the number of diseases, the decisions of persons and hospitals may not be sufficient enough to consider, take and correct their responsibilities, if such measures are not taken before.
The report on the results of risk assessment also includes measures in the field of public health to reduce the impact of the pandemia.
The countries have only a little time during which they can enhance their efforts in the field of control in order to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 distribution and reduce their health protection systems.
If not, the health system in other countries of the EU/EEE will be associated with an intensive therapy in the nearest days or weeks.
Coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), which is called for the coronavirus of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was a tragedy for ability: at this time in China and in other countries of the world was over 3 000 people, and the number of infected was over 80 000.
As a homosexual SARS-CoV virus, which has caused a heavy respiratory syndrome for thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transferred from flying mouse and causes similar symptoms using similar mechanism.
However, the COVID-19 is different from the lower level of disease and the lower level of employment than the SARS, but it is much more infected and often affected by older people than young and men than women.
In response to the streaming increase in the number of p’s new diseases in this article, the current and comprehensive review of the quickly developing subject of the investigation is conducted.
We will consider the basic and the principles of epidemiology, theeology, virusology, diagnosis, treatment, prognoses of further fluctuation and the profile of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions are still to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and enhance dangerous diseases.
The Chinese New Year (Chine New Year), which was exposed to 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay at home for a week and for many weeks after it.
Since the high level of similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) in 2003, the World Health Protection (WHO) on 11 February 2020 called this virus SARS-CoV-2 and the co-infection of the Coronavirus Infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic was started in Uhan, and it was quickly spread throughout the country, and then nearly 50 other countries of the world.
According to COVID-19, more than 40 000 patients were healthy, more than 3.000 patients had been discovered on 2 March 2020.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "number one for society" and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.日bi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than two months of COVID-19, including articles on its virusology, epidemiology, theology, diagnosis and treatment, starting from the first report of 7 January 2020, in which the effects of the virus was determined by a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to report the results of the research in the new and quickly developing area.
As soon as possible, we are trying to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other caused coronaviral diseases — the coronavirus of the near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS), which has occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts of the profile and the predictation of the disease fluid, and some other matters are not less difficult.
Coronaviruses were traditionally addressed to the number of pathogens which are not deadly dangerous for humans and are mainly affected by about 15 per cent of general respiratory diseases 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we were two times with high-patogen human coronavirs, namely with the coronavir of a severe heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of a close-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which were particularly in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively and were distributed to many other States with a terrible level of weakness and disorder.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third insufficiency of the coronaviral infection in the history.
As shown in recital 1.1, the report on the cases of non-renewment cases first occurred to the National Health Commission of the UNRK from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, genetic effects of virus were issued.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Uhan.
At the time, the epidemic was rapidly spread into neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of the mediums has been able to provide the possibility of transmission of virus from humans.
On 23 January, Uhan was introduced a coratin and stopped the urban public transport.
On 24 January, in the first cycle of this disease, 21 of 41 patients with coronaviral infection were contacted with the market of marine products in Uhana, which was considered an expansion point of the infection from non-animal.
On 30 January, the WHO announced that the success of the coronavirus was a global emergency situation in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of this report, the disease has been extended throughout China and has already occurred around 50 other countries throughout the world (subsection 2.2).
Taking into account the efficient development of the situation, the efficiency and the risk of sustainability are still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, after a lot of studies in which 8 866 patients, including 4 021 patients with COVID-19, were presented an updated epidemical development image (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 inspection has been confirmed by all age groups, but mainly people were sick from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) of the infected were more than 50 years, totally small — 20 years, and only 14 infected have not yet been completed 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men above (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clasters mainly in the Province of Hubai and nearby regions.
At the meantime of the presentation of COVID-19 symptoms, the diagnosis was 5 (2 to 9 days.
The incubation period was averagely 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Since the symptoms were shown before death was in the meantime, 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproduction indicator (R0) with ≥ 3,77 (95 % CI: 3,51–4,05), and R0 rectified by 2/2,23–4,82.
By 23 January 2020, the exponential increase in the number of infected persons co-operated in time with the high-transport of China’s New Year.
The mortality of patients with subcutaneous diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%) and the corrected level of kvalitet among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4.59%).
Three main risk factors in the case of COVID-19 infection were: half (man), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia events.
Coronaviruses constitute a subseed of major inflammation viruses containing one or more significant RNCs.
They can be divided into four kinds, e.g. alfa, beta, gamma and delta, from which the alpha and betacoronavirus, likely, fight people.
In the case of the coronavirus of type SARS and MERS glycoprotein of ship-visible growth (S) are related to cell-receptors of the type 2 of an angiotensin converting farm (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidese-4 (DPP4) as follows as a membrane synthesis occurs.
In cytoplasm, a gene of virus NCB is released; after the replication of the virus genomogene, the GNK generates virus containing vecicles, which are then combined with the membrane cell with the release of virus.
The first reports on the genealogy of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, a gene of 99.98 per cent corresponds to 10 follow-up models in the first place of the disease in the market of Juanan products in Uhan.
Genetic SARS-CoV-2 is close to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With a promoting electronic microscope of SARS-CoV-2, the Ultratone of human respiratory episodes were detected.
The ACE2 farm is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2 farm more than in case SARS-CoV, which explains that SARS-CoV-2 is caused by patients to be less weak than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate an earlier short-life white, encoded orf3b, and a secreted white, encoded orf8.
SARRS-CoV-2 can play some role from the points of virus pathogenicity and reduce the IFNb expression; but orf8 does not contain any functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, the collection of authors in Chapter Jou (Zhou) has reported on the Cryoelectron Tomography structure of ACE2 a full-dimensional farmer, with a permit of 2.9 Å in a combination with the B0AT aminocide transporter
They discovered that this complex, in which open and closed contentions, was collected as a dimension and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins that served as a evidence of the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a mixture of therapy when conducting a medical skrining for reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origination and intermediate host
It is known that the source and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flying mouses from which the virus was translated to man through the circles and steels respectively.
With the SARS-CoV-2 filogue, with other coronaviruses, it was established that I’m flying muscles by the first carriers SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the SARS coronavirus, namely the SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains not what kind of intermediate master, with which the virus has been able to overcome the specify barier and to infect humans; the way of transfer is still to be found.
Mr. Zzy (Ji) and colleagues suggested that the transmission of virus from flying muscles to humans became smoke in the process of homosexual recombination in S-proteine.
Following their investigation, Chinese scientists from Guanthaw suggested that the pangolines are long-term milk, which are often used in the traditional Chinese medication, which are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this provision is based on 99 percent genetic equality between pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference between both genes is very large, therefore it is considered that the results with specific evidence have not yet been received (section 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still not yet.
In the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV laboratories, they may survive within 48 hours of sugar and up to 5 days at the temperature of below 20 °C and 40 to 50 % of the property.
SARS-CoV-2 can have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraphiliolet and covering up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effectively blocking virus activity can be efficiency, 75 percent heat sphere, chlorocontaining products, sandusic acid, chloroform and other solvents, but not chloride.
Human population is generally not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are acceptable to a new virus.
There are no data on the detailed studies of immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can do only to earlier studies of other coronavirus, firstly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (section 4).
As a rule of rule in the master’s body, the immune system recognises an expected immune system through visual recognition of recipients (OR), including C-type, Toll-like recipients, NOD-like recipients and RIG-I-like recipients.
By means of various mechanisms, the virus produces an expression of fuel factors, the creation of dendrite cells and the synthesis of interferons of type I, which maintain the distribution of virus and reduce macrofagocytose for virus antigens.
However, using N-white SARS-CoV can avoid immune reactions.
A adaptive immune reaction is included in the fight against the virus.
T-limfocytes, including T cells CD4+ and CD8+, play a significant role in the protection of the body.
CD4+ cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific anticipation in B cells, and T CD8+ cells directly kill the infected cell virus.
T-Helpers produce contrary to citokins that help protection cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions by providing their programned destruction.
The humanitarian immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, plays also an important role in combating virus infection.
For example, an anticipation from a healthy patient neutralised MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system is the local education of a large number of free radicals, which may be caused by serious damage of the institutions and other organs, and in the decreasing scenario to lead to polyorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, for which a classic manifestation is more likely to affect older people with co-patient pathology and female women.
The potential of infection above for people who have a large number of viruses or have immune systems.
According to the results of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhan, the average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1 099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, while the dilution was between 0 and 24 days.
More lately described above the demography analysis of 8 866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day.
For healthcare bodies, it is very important to correct the periods of the careline measures provided in the most precise estimates of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus of those infected with which the disease is prolonged without a symptom.
Communities on 14-day care for persons, name of contacts with virus or infected virus.
Should the time of the karan duration be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which may be the only manifestation of other symptoms, such as sucking symptoms, disorders, muscle diseases, circumcision, pain, cold pain, mildness, breast pain, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, and hot.
Some patients have noticed the illness and/or hypo.
In difficult cases, the rapid progress of the disease was developed, and the patients developed a heavy respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acid and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and (or) symptoms of respiratory illness and heat illness should be checked on virus for the early diagnosis of the diagnosis even if there is no pathology on the fat cell photos.
The demography of the study carried out at the end of December 2019 discovered the symptom distribution indicators: 98 per cent — high temperature, 76 per cent sugar ≥ 55 per cent, and 3 per cent diaries; 8 per cent of patients needed experienced ventilation.
Analogic results were received in the two last studies of the cases of infection in the family and the transfers of virus from unsymptomly infected.
The comparative results were received in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms had also high temperature (98%), sugar (47%) and decrease (55%).
However, 80% of them needed experimental ventilation, this indicator is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to the higher level of MERS than COVID-19.
MERS patients also observed diaries (26 %) and throat pain (21 %).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99-100%), sugar ≥ 29-75 %, diarrhoea (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25 %) and throat pain (13-25 %), and the experienced ventilation of patients requires 14-20 %.
On 14 February, COVID-19 consisted of 2 per cent and the total number of cases in the world reached 66 576.
In comparison with this indicator, the SARS was estimated by 10 per cent of 8 096 cases.
In the case of MERS demography, the investigation carried out in June 2012 showed a level of 37 per cent of 2 494 cases.
Following a previous study, the SARS-CoV-2 base indicator (R0) was defined at 6.47 at 95 % of the confidential interval (CI) in sections 5.71 to 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Compare SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, levels and R0 contained in Table 1.
The above indicators testify of the higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to distribute in comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the level of kvalitet in the case of infection by new virus below compared to the two last.
Therefore, holding SARS-CoV-2 epidemies will be much more difficult than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Classic manifestation often occurs in the areas of a family or group of people who are gathered together for any reason or for any transport, such as cross-layer.
Patients were often induced in Mr. Uhan, or in other terrified regions, living there or contacting infected or sick during the last two weeks before the start of the disease.
However, according to the reports shown, people may be virus carriers without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and the patients treated from the hospital may again become virus carriers, and this is anxious signal for the duration of the time of the karan.
At the early stage, the normal or decreased number of leucocytes (annual limfocytes) in the blood peripher.
For example, 1 099 patients with COVID-19 were established with leucocytes < 4x109/L, including leucocytes < 1x109/L, as well as an increased level of asparagine-aminotransferaz and viruse.
In the blood of some patients, increased levels of feed, muscle ferments and myoglobin were found, and most patients were observed increasing levels of S-reactive waste and blood erytrocytes.
Patients with a severe D-dimensional illness, the blood-related fibrine disorder was increased and the number of limfocytes was continually reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 in the rentgenographic study of the breast cell have been detected pathology that characterizes non-equivalent exhibitions from both sides or exhausts of the type "mate glass".
Patients are often developing apatic nerve, heavy disorder and heavy respiratory disease.
In the development of uncontrolled OSH fuel, heating and progressive phybroses results in an intensive disturbance of gases.
The disfunction of types I and II pneumonites reduces the level of surface-active units and increases the overall stress, thus reduces the ability to expand and increases the risk of falling.
Thus, the worst results of the study are often matching the most severe disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrator of pneumatics, the form of gialin membranes and limfocytical infiltration, and multilateral syncs of cells in patients who died from disease, correspond to the pathology of virus infection and ORZ and similarly found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As a key criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the method was to find the SARS-CoV-2 NCR through a polymeral heat reaction with back transcriptase (CRC with back transcriptase).
However, taking into account the high level of false-party results that could lead to the development of the epidemic, since 13 February 2020, the diagnosis began to be diagnosed in clinical manifestations (increasingly uncertainly on the CCP with a back transcriptase).
Analogically, SARS was diagnosed.
It is therefore critically important for effective diagnosis and is necessary to comply with the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratories tests and the results of the study.
On 14 February 2020, the group of specialists under Mr. Fenjzhana (Feng Zhang) described the protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK method, which was repeated in the CRISPR, to find SARS-CoV-2; this method allows the synthetic fragments of RNC SARS-CoV-2 to detect from 20 × 10–18 ml/l to 200 × 10–18 ml/l (10–100 copies per microlitre of the original model) with indicators less than for a time without using a complex equipment.
This new methodology, if it is successfully checked on clinical medicinal products, can increase the sensitivity of tests and the satisfaction of their conduct.
As a result of non-coronavirus experience before, doctors may mainly provide only patients with COVID-19 supporting therapy, attempting to use any treatment methods used or used in treatment with other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (Tab-2.2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antivirus medicines, immunity suppliers, steroids, plasma health of patients, Chinese traditional medication and psychological support.
Therapy has been used to use even plasma hepatitis of patients.
Pharmaceutical companys will be able to describe anti- and vaccines for the fight against virus.
At the beginning phases of SARS-CoV-2 is a fundamental attack, and may at least affect other organs expressing ACE2, such as iron-shirt and pockets.
However, the distortion of the work and refusal of the spirit organs is the main threat and cause of patients' death.
In order to facilitate symptoms and salvation of life, therefore, it is critically important to support the respiratory function, including the general oxygen treatment, the high oxygen conhibition, the non-invasive experimental ventilation and the invasive mechanical ventilation of oxygen, which are indicated depending on the weight of illness.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms of support in the form of extreme-corporal membrane of the gender (ECMO), a modified extrapolmonal blood reaction method used to treat a threat to life of heart or respiratory insufficiency.
Moreover, the importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is to maintain water-sound balance, prevent and treat secondary infections and seventh choices, as well as the protection of functions of lifely important organs.
It is known that the cytokinal storm is the result of the hyperactivity of the immune system of patients infected by SARS and MERS virus.
The citokinian storm is a form of a systemic recycling process that is developing in response to the series of citokins, including TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNb, IFNb, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to emission of a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of the OCS and the polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in heavy state, the most important is to increase immunity.
For the treatment of the citokin storm, corticosteroids and tocilizumabs, monoklonates and antichlorides served as interlacin-6 inhibitor.
In the number of other methods of the treatment of cytokine storm, which are increasing immunity, the modulation of immune response for T-cell control; the blocking of IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF cytokines; the degradation of yanus-kinasis; the application of blinatumamab, cytokine signals 4 and the hystondeacetalas inhibitors.
In order to decrease the weight of the repeated processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are largely applied as immunity suppliers.
Steroids in large doses, however, do not benefit from treating serious damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they may cause serious side effects, especially the avask’s osteonecrose, which are significantly disturbing the prognoses.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended to apply carefully when treating COVID-19 patients in critical states.
There is no effective antivirus therapy in the time of the present document.
However, the intravenous introduction of Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was a effective treatment of the American patients with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is recently an antivirus medicinal product, initially diluted by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebol and Marburg virus.
Later remedisvir also demonstrates the possibility of degrading other viruses with a single-expected RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.
By confidence in these data, the company of Gilead has given China’s medication for a couple of studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are expected to be incomplete.
Moreover, as the therapy options of patients with intense respiratory symptoms were offered bar-tinib, a-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin.
Combined treatment with lopinavira/ritonavir may be conducted by diaries, heat, throat, disorders and other side effects.
It should be carefully observed that these medicines are involved with other medicinal products designed to patients.
Plasmoid of health of patients and you are an anticipate
Blood in patients, treated from infection, treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease, or for health protection of people has been used for a long time.
In fact, the health of patients often contains a high quantity of anticipants for the fight against pathogen.
Anthony is in immunoglobuline produced by B-limfocytes for combating pathogens and other internal objects; they recognize from where patogen molecules and neutralize them directly.
In the course of this precaution, there was a plasma from the blood models of the group of patients who were treated from COVID-19, which then introduced 10 hepatic patients.
During 24 hours, their symptoms were improved, reduced the heat of burning and virus load and increased blood saturation with oxygen.
However, to propose the massive application of this method before therapy specification, it is necessary until the checks and non-explications have been carried out.
Furthermore, with regard to therapy of the effect, some of the failures of plasma should be studied carefully.
For example, an anticipation can stimulate the immune system and cause a cytokine emission syndrome that, taking into account the ability, represents a potential threat to life.
The blood anticipation is usually increasing, and the plasma for the treatment of patients in critical states requires much.
It is easy to make and produce specific anticipations quickly enough to combat global epidemics.
Thus, more important and more important to identify the B-cells of health of patients and to determine the genetic code of anticipates or to carry out secrets in order to find anticipates against critically important virus whites.
So we're going to go to the mass-production of antender.
The Chinese have been a traditional medication for the treatment of various diseases for thousands of years.
However, its efficiency is significantly dependent on the consistency of the components of the formula, which is different from the diagnosis of diagnosis of the Chinese traditional medical theories.
Most effective components are still not or devices are not defined, since the designation and checking of these components or their optimal counterpart is employed.
Currently, because there is no effective specificity of the COVID-19 traditional Chinese medication, it was one of the main alternative methods for treatment of patients with a light and medium-term hepatitis or for patients who are healing after a severe stage of disease.
For example, the capsules Shu Fen Cze Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and the capsules Lann Hua Cin Ven (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were recognised effectively in the treatment of COVID-19.
The most healthy part of patients with COVID-19 was noted in a number of provinces of China, in which China’s traditional medication was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including in Ghanes (63.7%), Ninse (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in the Province of Hubay, where the Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, was fixed the lowest level of health (13%).
It is, however, adequately deep comparison, since the effects should be carried out in the light of the other factors, such as the number of patients and the degrees of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and its colleagues repeated the studies materials in the context of which the treatment was compared exclusively by the methods of western medical and combinated treatment on the methods of western medical and Chinese traditional medication.
They discovered that the periods of normalisation of the body temperature, elimination of symptoms and medical assistance under stationary conditions were less sensitive for patients who were used for the combination of western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who were treated only in western methods.
The most miraculous is that the part of patients who had started to deteriorate the symptom (with a easy state to a weak) was noted below in the group treated by the methodology of west and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only in western methods (7,4 per cent compared to 46,2 per cent), and the level of ability in the first group was lower than in the second (8,8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
However, China's traditional medical safety still requires more closely controlled studies conducted in larger and more regions.
It also provides the ability to describe and explain the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medical methods, or their compounds.
Patients who have understood or confirmed the nature of COVID-19 are mainly experienced in fear of anxiety and even increasing disease, and people who are closed to the corantine also experience sugar, unity and extreme distress.
Furthermore, such symptoms of infections such as liver, hypo, and §eel, as well as the side-treatment, such as corticosteroide unsounding, can cause further great anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early phases of the SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including depression chronic, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychiatric symptoms, depression and even successful behavior.
The commitment to monitoring contacts and carantines in the number of measures undertaken by healthcare bodies for the maintenance of the COVID-19 epidemic can strengthen the concern and feelings of the victims with the distribution of infection, coratin and the clothes of their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, be suspicious and contacted with them, as well as all the other people it requires.
In the context of the psychological support, multiprofiles of psychiatric assistance should be developed, adjusted clear information with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and use electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contacts.
Effective vaccines play a significant role in the interruption of the transmission of animals and infected infections to farmers and are often applied in addition to the antiviral treatment used to maintain epidemies caused by new virus.
A vaccine was carried out based on S-protein, aimed at creating long-term and high-active anti-neutral anticipation and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, living heated vaccines from SARS virus were diluted.
However, before clinical studies, it is necessary to determine the ability of these vaccines in natural conditions when they are used in age patients, the model of infection by doses and the degree of protection from the infection of zone virus.
The cause may be that the SARS virus was missing 17 years ago, and no new case has been reported.
At the same time, conscious cases and classifications of illness resulting from the MERS virus in the Middle East and spread in other regions by maintaining zone sources in the areas of endemic residence.
In order to combat MERS, vaccinations were spread with the use of the inactivated virus, the DNA plasma, the virus vectors, the nightmare, the similar parts and the recombinant white elements, and some of these have passed on animals.
Once a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity persons, it is an inevitable and critical task that requires a decision to maintain exciting epidemic.
However, serious difficulties are expected by a period of 18 months (in average), to repeat vaccine, and dynamic vision of coronavirus.
As an inevitable illness, COVID-19 only begins to show the full image of the fluid rate of illness for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be gradually healed without disorder.
However, COVID-19, similarly SARS and MERS, also with high frequency and high frequency among patients with a serious period of disease.
In this regard, it is critically important for healthcare bodies to create a prognosy model of disease in order to determine the priority of their measures, especially in the areas where the lack of resources is observed.
On the basis of clinical studies presented at the current time, factors may affect the predictation of the disease fluid in patients with COVID-19 or be able to be with it (Tab-33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the predicting of the disease fluid caused by SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects patients in age of 30 to 65 years, 47.7 per cent of which are more than 50 years old than 8 866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive therapy were more likely to have caused diseases and difficulties, and they were significantly higher than those who did not need such therapy (in average 66 years against 51), which testifies that the age is a prognosy factor for patients with COVID-19.
Paul: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men above (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Patients with COVID-19 needing intensive therapy are higher than the probability of miocardial and arithmical disorders.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of the death of patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 could also be associated with ACE2 local holongiocytes, which could cause the disturbance of work in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and source diseases are closely related and may affect the results.
Rejections detected in laboratories: C-reaction level in blood reflects the degree of the hepatic process or disorders, and it is considered as a potential prognostic factor for the fluid of disease, therapy reactions and healing.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the C-reactive level, the level of disease and the predictation of COVID-19.
Moreover, a higher level of lactosehydrogenase, asparagine-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase and creatininase may also be suggested.
These farms in large quantities are allocated by different bodies, especially with heart and swine, and their emissions occur when weakening.
Thus, they are traditionally marked by heart or penitential disfunction.
Basic clinical symptoms: to predict the results and difficulties of the treatment of COVID-19 and other factors, data should be taken into account of the survey of the breast cell and the development of clinical symptoms in time.
Steroids: As described above, steroids are the immunity data used in infektional diseases as an additional therapy to decrease the degree of the reproductive process.
Since the treatment of patients with weak forms of SARS was largely used by corticosteroids, many of the survival diseases developed a avaku’ s osteonecrose, which caused lifetime incapacity and low quality of life.
Therefore, if the use of steroides is necessary for treatment of patients with COVID-19, these medicines should be indicated in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, COVID-19 epidemic background, many patients suffer from unpredicted strong stress, as they often have to maintain the long periods of the karanthood, to cope with a high degree of indetermination and to observe the death of their family and other patients.
In order to avoid the stress of such patients and to help them return to normal life, psychological consultations should be conducted and long-term supported.
According to the current demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemy appears to be different from the SARS epidemia.
Despite the replication in the lower ways, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronaviruses that cause normal simple diseases, can be successfully multiplied in the respiratory ways and cause symptoms or no symptoms in the early infection stage.
As a result, patients who have a previous stage of illness or have not yet ended the incubation period may, by conducting their normal life, spread the virus in significant dimensions that will be an epidemiological control.
However, the SARS-CoV virus transfer was considered when patients were sick, while most of the cases had not occurred in the early stage of infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemia is much more serious than SARS, and it is more difficult to control it.
Today, there is a great work in China that has been announced by the universal coratin in Mr. Uhan and neighborhood cities and a long-term karan regime for all the population to stop the SARS-CoV-2 spread.
Despite these measures, the large economy and other areas of life of the country, the number of new patients are reduced, which is stated on the delay of the expansion of epidemia.
At the most optimistic estimates, the insufficiency of the disease will be completed to March, and the injury phase will be extended for 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hanter (Paul Hunter) and the colleagues underlined that COVID-19, which looks much more infected than SARS, would not end in 2020.
The researchers of the group of Ira Longini (Ira Longini) designed a model for the predicting of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world population.
The group of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in nose-and-shirts taken in patients, health and exposed from hospital two weeks ago, which indicates that the new virus could be an analogic grip disease.
However, reducing the number of new cases in China is hoped by indicating that the current effects of the situation may have been affected.
According to the original prognoses, Ebola's army should have been killed up to a million people and become a cause of the loss of half million patients.
However, because of the extreme care and isolation of the disease, it was finally able to be controlled.
There is the possibility that, like SARS-CoV virus, the ability to infect SARS-CoV-2 may be weak, and in time it will disappear or become less pathogen virus with a person.
The following comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS epidemies (Ris. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is characterised by a high speed of transmission through the transmission or the shilling and may be directly contacted with the materials threatened by the virus.
The virus was also found in the wallet, which means that it is also an oral-effective way of transfer.
According to one of the recent studies, 41 per cent of the 138 studies may have been the result of the infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical patients.
It is therefore necessary to take serious precautions to protect people, especially health careers, families, colleagues, and even foreign people who are contacted or infected.
The first line of defense in combating the reduction of the risk of infection is the mask for →; and the chirurgical masks, and the N95-Class Respirators (Series No. 1860s) helped to control the distribution of virus.
The chirurgical masks do not give microcappets of potentially infected fluids and sitting on the surfaces with which they can be translated to the surroundings.
However, only the masks of N95 (series No 1860s) can protect from inhaling viruses from 10 to 80 nm, they only exceed 5 % of virus; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they both are about 85 nm.
Since parts may even occur through five chirurgical masks combined together, medical mediators, directly contacting patients, should have the N95 class masks (series No. 1860s), not chirurgical masks.
Besides the mask, medical agents should carry out an added protection chalate on the figure in order to further decrease the possibility of contact with virus.
Virus can also fall into organism through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, despite the mask of the N95 class; maybe the virus was in his body through the burning eyes.
Therefore, medical agents should also carry out transparent faces or protective eyes of a closed type.
It is recommended that all people in the mistake or potentially threatened regions are frequently recommended to determine their own funds, to try not to get out of the house with self-isolation, and to contact potentially infected people.
The distance to the patient is considered racial about a meter.
These measures reduce effectively the risk of infection and prevent the distribution of virus.
Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not before, the high degree of its comparison with SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, was to become anxious signal for China, taking into account the experience they received during the SARS success in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for the Control of illnesses to Mr. Uhanh made peace with the citizens, reporting that the new virus is a low countervailability and the lasting reproductiveness of human transfer to humans and that the prevention of the distribution and control of diseases is not a problem.
This statement was significantly reduced by the pressure, especially during the period when the whole country was ready to celebrate China’s New Year, and a critical time was lost when the disease could be maintained in the areas of Mr. Uhanh with minimum losses.
China's health care bodies can take this serious lesson and bring significant improvements in the future.
For example, healthcare authorities should be: (1) to make more careful public statements, since each word is considered to citizens and may affect their view and decisions; (2) to follow and respond more carefully to the necessary information from the clinic and not to expect of the official reports from doctors and officers; (3) to take more decisive measures to maintain the potential epidemic in the early phases of its development and not to encourage the public; and (4) to carry out the objectives and efficient teachings to improve the level of information of the population on the epidemic diseases and the regular control and improvement of the reaction of society.
The COVID-19 incidence of the previously unused coronavirus of a severe severe respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) started at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the illness covered China, and at the time of this document was extended in 50 countries of the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavir of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the COVID-19 similar symptoms of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 experienced the SARS receptive feeling.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significantly significant to the maintenance of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 is a greater degree of older people than young people, and men greater than women; the number of difficult cases and levels of kvalitet among elderly people are also higher than among young people.
Mortality by SARS above in case of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsimptomatic, while SARS-patients usually are affected only in difficult cases of disease, therefore keep the COVID-19 distribution more difficult than SARS.
This is partly explaining why SARS-CoV-2 is extended much faster and greater than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal tests to the SARS-CoV-2 RNC.
On the other hand, the patients treated may show you again to place virus tests.
All this increases the risk of the distribution of virus.
The COVID-19 investigations are still resolved by some important issues, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite discovering a 96 percent homolog between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS-flight muscle coronavirus, we can still not say that SARS-CoV-2 infection has occurred from flying mouse.
What animal has been the intermediate species of the virus from the original master, such as flying mouse, to humans?
Without knowledge of the answers to the first and second question, we cannot hopefully stop the way of transmission, and the epidemiological situation can be extended at any time.
Modeling at milk level and biochemical tests demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 relates to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into the cells of respiratory pathological changes and resulted in the following pathological changes?
Does the virus also relate to the ACE2 cells in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure the rapid and precise diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemie be?
How is the virus genetic evolution in the process of transfer from humans to humans?
Will he be the cause of the world pandemia, whether he will also deceive the SARS or will periodically recapitalise such a grip?
These are primarily important, but there will be time to search for answers to these and many other issues.
However, we have no other choice, except what it should be, to stop the epidemic as far as possible and to return to the normal life.
Zone origin of the Coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation stimulated the coevolution of coronavirus (CoV) and their carriers, including people for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two coronavirus (HCoV) were caused to cause a easy disease, such as normal prostitute.
The efforts of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) and of a near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our idea of how disastrous and dangerous human coronavirus can be to life.
The appearance of the coronavirus of a severe heavy respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) in the Central China at the end of 2019 renewed attention to the coronavirus and surprised us with high translation, but more expressed by the pathogenity of this virus compared to the SARS-CoV family virus.
The human coronaviral infection is a zone, and the understanding of its zone origin will be very important.
Most human coronavirus occur from flying mouses for which they are not patogenic.
There are also intermediate reservators of some coronavirs.
The definition of animal weighters has an effort to prevent the spread of diseases.
Study of the interaction of animals, I'm Property of coronavirus, can also shine light on the patogenese of the coronavirus in humans.
In this consideration, we provide information on the seven coronavirs, giving the primary attention to the history of their discovery, as well as their areas and ways of transmission.
It is important to note that we have a comparison and comparison of various coronavirs from the view of the virus evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, the today’s epidemic of the disease of coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19).
Furthermore, the conditions for successful changes are noted and the impact of virus evolution on the weight of disease.
Coronaviruses are related to the Coronaviridae family, representing a group of refrigerator viruses with one locally poor RNC.
These viruses with the largest of the NCB-containing viruses from 26 to 32 thousand nuclears have received a name through their form that recalls the crown under electronic microscope.
From the view of the structure, the coronavirus contains the genemens aggregated with the identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the geneome contain two major part-opening counting frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteine.
These polyproteines are further processed to generate 16 nest-tradeed whites of nsp1~16.
The rest of the gene contains open calculations for structured whites, including white white (S), cloud white (E), membrane white (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines, the coronavirus has also encoded a number of line-specific white accessors.
The differences in the follow-up were four types of coronavirus (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacoronavirus), which includes most of the coronavirus and divides into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The philogenetic evidence is that the genetic source of the majority of alpha and betacoronavirus I flying mouse and grass, while birds are the main reserve for gamma and deltacoronavirus.
Thousands of coronavirus have continued to overcome inter-video bariers, and some of them have evolution to human pathogens.
Today there are seven coronavirs.
Their numbers are related to the HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alphakoronavirus.
The rest of five betacoronavirus includes HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the coronavir of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavirus of the near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the coronavirus of the severe heavy respiratory syndrome of the type SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause a simple form, such as prostitution and/or diaries.
In contrast with them, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoV and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 extremely pathogens are caused by serious infections of lower respiratory pathways in comparison with a higher quantity of patients with a higher probability of developing a heavy respiratory disease (ORZ) and the manifestation of external symptoms.
The first rubber of HCoV-229E coronavirus, B814, was received from the pattern of the patient's nosoglote, painful in the 1960s.
With these extensive studies, more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses have been recorded, which cause the symptoms of local infection.
In fact, before a severe heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred a generally accepted concept, which was totally unconceived by the coronavirus.
The SARS in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8 000 people were infected, and the general kvalitets indicator was about 10 per cent.
For decades, the emergency of the near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to long epidemics in the Arabic half-year-old, and the disease was prolonged in the rest of the world.
The new coronavir (2019-nCoV) found in 2019, which was recently renamed to SARS-CoV-2, is a rebuilder of the current coronaviral infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, at 3 March 2020, had exceeded 3 120 lives, and the number of infected was over 91.000 people.
The severe signal has been received and the world must be prepared for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemia.
All seven coronavirs have a zone of origin, their sources of flying mouse, mouse or home animals.
Many data sets are witnessed in the benefit of the evolutional nature of all the muscle coronavirs from the flying muscles that have been well adapted to the organs in which viruses have been well adapted and in which they do not display pathogenic properties, but demonstrate a wide variety of genetics.
The COVID-19 epidemic has abandoned China and the world's severe call from medical, scientific, and moral view.
The survey of the areaal mechanism of the origin of the Coronavirus will allow their natural history to understand their evolution and their intervisible transmission forces.
It may also indicate or have the search for a reserver, an intermediate and amplificing SARS-CoV-2 drive, which is very important to prevent the re-expansion of disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the area of origin, intervisual transfer and pathogenesis of the coronavirus.
In particular, we consider and consider the general characteristic: the original viruses of the coronavirus are usually not patogenic for their reserveholders, but receive patogenic character after transmission of the new mediator.
We also analyze the trend of the evolution of the coronavirs, which often leads to the decreasing of traveling properties.
In the same context, the result of the current insufficiency of SARS-CoV-2 is considered.
Animal coronavirus is since the end of the 1930s.
Before the B814 virus of HCoV-229E was first obtained from the pattern of the patient's nosolocate, painfulness, different coronavirus for different infected animals, including indeals, mouse, wheat, wheat, cow, and dogs.
Seven coronavirs have been detected in recent decades.
Table 1 is incompatible and monitored with a short history of the detection of coronavirus in chronic order.
The first rate of HCoV-229E virus was obtained from the tests taken from the respiratory paths of patients with infectional disorders in 1966; in addition, this virus is adjusted in WI-38 cell lines.
Patients infected by HCoV-229E have shown simple symptoms, including pain, disorder, general disabilities and pain in the hot temperature and ≥20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was from the organic culture and the following series of muscles.
Clinical signs of infection by HCoV-OC43 appear to be similar infections by HCoV-229E, which are not distinguishable with other respiratory pathogens, such as type A grip viruses and renovirus viruses.
And the HCoV-229E virus and HCoV-OC43 have a global distribution in the world and are normally transferred in winter widths.
In the main incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, and there should be some two-week sickness.
According to the results of volunteers' studies, healthy people infected by HCoV-229E have developed a normal light form-prostum.
Only a few patients with weak immunity have been severely infected by the lower paths.
The SARS effort, as well as the "Atipical Pneumonia epidemy", became the first of the history of the well-documentated pandemy, which was called for human coronavirus, and the rebuilding of the disease was the virus of SARS-CoV, the third of the detected coronavirus.
The first case of the SARS disease was detected at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guandun.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease and 774 death were documented, and the disease was spread in many countries and different continents.
Without prejudice to the surhactive distributors, it was estimated that each iller could heal about two more people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the tissue of the virus load was in the 10th weeks of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, pain in muscles, pains, high temperature, general disabilities and knowledge have occurred, and among more light symptoms have been counted as a coverage, a respiratory insufficiency.
Extended laboratory indicator refuses from the SARS-norms are limfope, inflammation in petroleum tests and increased creativity levels.
In patients with SARS, there is also a difused alveo damage, the proliferation of episodes and the increase in macrophagen levels.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients need intensive therapy and ventilation mechanism.
In such difficult cases, other bodies may also be infected, including the organs of iron-cooked tract, sands and pockets, which are usually associated with a citokinous storm that can be aircraft, especially for patients with weak immunity.
The first virus was of the open biopsy of a sick family who came to Hong Kong from Guanthaw.
With these couples, great efforts were made to investigate the coronavirs.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was a 7-month child from the Netherlands.
Snaʹ was established that he was primarily affecting children of age, elderly and patients with weak immunity and respiratory diseases.
For illnesses of HCoV-NL63, I have characteristics of the manifestations such as smurting, conjunctivity, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent investigation described the same virus of the narrow material taken by a 8-month boy from the Netherlands suffering of pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but it was actually distributed in total.
According to the calculation, HCoV-NL63 is a cause of approximately 4,7 per cent of spread respiratory diseases, and the pizza of the diseases that they are caused is to start the year, the weight and the winter.
HCoV-NL63 relates to the environment of the laring, which is also called Cru.
HCoV-HKU1 was in Hong Kong the same year from 71-year-old guest hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to non-hepatic and bronchiolyte, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with asthmatic diseases.
According to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which causes light form respiratory diseases, have been detected throughout the world.
All these four human coronavirs, which caused infections, were well adapted to people and their mutation, which caused high pathogenic diseases, normally, is less likely, even though the incidents were not their causes, as a rare example of more virusous substances of HCoV-NL63, which, in recent reports, caused a serious infection of the lower pathways in China.
Normally, with the ability to effectively transfer and maintain in human body, these coronavirus become less viral or patogenic.
The Coronavirus of the Near East Respiratory Syndrom (MERS-CoV) was first in 2012 in Saudi Arabia of a 60-year-old patient with an insufficiency and an insufficiency.
Most of the laboratory cases were located on the Middle East, but in various Peace countries and Tunisia, import events and distribution were registered through episode secondary cases of infection in close contacts.
Another secondary extent of 186 cases has occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS) remind of the symptoms of a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) — for both infections characteristicly progressively increasing pneumonia.
In contrast with SARS, many MERS patients have also developed an extreme insufficiency that the MERS is too different from the other diseases caused by coronavirus to be translated to a person.
More than 30 per cent of patients are observed by iron-coated symptoms such as diaries and fluids.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2.500 laboratories were registered under the cases of a high-level respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent), therefore, MERS-CoV was considered one of the most important viruses of humans.
During the middle to the end of December 2019, Uhan in the Chinese province of Hubay, patients with pneumonia were found now related to the infection called by the coronavirus of a severe severe respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Declared that the continuing infection of the underlying breast-feeding paths, called SARS-CoV-2, was a global emergency situation in the field of public health, and the same disease was called “coron-virus infection 19” (COVID-19).
On 3 March 2020, 90 053 were registered in the world in cases of cases, and there was approximately 3,4 per cent.
It should be noted that the employment in the Chinese province of Hubai is 4.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent in its range.
SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronavirus, causes a severe respiratory infection that is characterised by the increase of temperature, halt and coating.
Some patients are also observed in diaries.
Pneumonia is one of the most heavy symptoms and is able to quickly go to a respiratory insufficiency syndrome.
Despite the likeness of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high homography of nuclear sequences (82 per cent), these viruses, however, constitute different feeds of the filogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but is more ability to transfer compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Certain cases of an unsimptomous infection of SARS-CoV-2 have been registered, which testifies the ability of this virus to spread quickly throughout the world.
As a result of the comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six coronavirus, significant equality and differences are shown.
Firstly, coronaviruses have a similar period of incubation and duration of fluctuation of diseases.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the rest of six coronavirs.
Second, in the degree of the COVID-19 symptoms, it is between SARS-CoV and four coronaviruses that cause non-social infections (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to the most often observed by the infection of coronaviruses that cause non-social infections, including non-specific manifestations, symptoms or even the lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as well as when SARS-CoV is infected, a small subgroup of COVID-19 severe cases can be determined, although there is a little below.
Third, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the interesting legislation is also noted as well as for coronavirs that cause external infections, as well as for SARS-CoV.
On one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is, at least, the same high as the coronavirs that cause external infections.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to check whether SARS-CoV-2 is decreased with each following virus transition (e.g. by the infection of each person), such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The end, as well as other coronaviruses that cause external infections, can be found in SARRS-CoV-2.
We should still answer the question whether the fax-oral route to SARS-CoV-2 is the same significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
A particular interest is also questioned about the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 sezon, particularly for coronavirs that cause external infections.
However, the future development of COVID-19 will depend on SARS-CoV-2, including transferability, pathogenity and sustainable distribution after human transition.
All four coronavirs that caused non-hospital infections with the symptoms of a simple form were well adapted to people.
On the other hand, they may have been well adapted to these four coronavirus.
In other words, and those, and others could be called the only successful after the pandemies of the Coronavirus in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause people's harmful diseases, and people whose coronaviruses cause heavy diseases have simply not survived.
In order to happen this, the coronavirus should be reflected in the body in sufficient way to engrave adaptive mutations against the factors of the carrier.
In this sense, as longer the SARS-CoV-2 suspension will be extended and more people will be infected, more than the possibility that the virus is completely adapted to humans.
If he is well adapted, his transfer will be difficult to stop with the care or other infections control.
For many years, four non-hospital coronavirs have been circled by people with healthy immunity.
This virus does not require animal reserves.
High-pathogen coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been adjusted enough to humans and their transfers may not be supported.
They need to be maintained and multiplied in their zone reserves and seeking cases of improving mixtures, perhaps through one or several intermediate or strengthening drivers.
SARS-CoV-2 contains boxes similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four non-hospital viruses of HCoV.
It is very easily translated as an infirm HCoV, at least now.
But he's more pathogeneous than the infirmary HCoV, and less pathogenous than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether it is completely adapted to a person and whether it will be circulated in the environment without a reserver or with a intermediate animal weapon.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, we will discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution, natural, intermediate, strengthening and reserved HCoV virus devices.
The lives serve as the HCoV evolutional driver if it transfers a neighborhood preacher from the same high homologia at nuclear successivity level.
Previous virus is usually well adjusted and unpatogeneously in this driver.
In the meantime, the reserve carrier continues to transfer HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and I have natural HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV was only taken in a intermediate carrier right before or about the time he was brought to a person, he was not well adjusted to the new driver and often patogenically.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zone source of → infection and play a role of the enhanced drive, allowing the virus to be molnically replicated and then transferred it to people, strengthening the infections of people.
HCoV may carry a dump infection if it is not possible to hold the transmission inside the intermediate device.
Instead, HCoV viruses can also be adapted to the intermediate mediator and even establish a long endemic.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reserve device.
Epidemiological data have shown that the SARS’s nul patients had anonymous contact with industrial animals (child).
Further severe prevalence studies showed that the IgG anticipation of the SARS-CoV virus is higher than the population.
The gymalaian cyvets (Paguma larvata) and the ennovisual dog in the live animal markets were the first set of virus vehicles, similar and similar SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly under the fact that the SARS cases have not been reported after all the markets were carried out.
At the same time, it was notified that the gymalae civics in nature or farms and non-marketing markets did not determine in most cases SARS-CoV that could conclude that the gymalian civilians could serve only as an intermediate strengthening driver, not as a natural SARS-CoV reserver.
It is noted that, since 80 per cent of the different animals in Guanthaw markets have antenites to SARS-CoV, the probabilities that intermediate enhanced drivers can also serve many kinds of small milk.
They all seem to be a stupid SARS-CoV virus devices.
The following search for the natural animal weapon SARS-CoV found a neighborhood CoV flying mouse, which was called by the atypical pool coronavirus of HKU3 subcutaneous muscles (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese subcutaneous muscles.
These mouse are on antenites to SARS-CoV and the genetic follow-up of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other muscle coronaviruses have 88 to 92 per cent the same homology of the impact of nuclears as SARS-CoV.
These studies were based on the new concept that the flying mouse was the carriers of new pathogens.
A number of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) was also found in the flying mouse, but no one of them, except one that indicated WIV1, was isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is an angiotension converting farm 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from the fical muscle test, uses ACE2 flying mouse, cyber and human receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, hepatitis patients with SARS could neutralize WIV
Today, WIV1 represents the closest SARS-CoV family preacher in the flying mouse, dividing 95% of nuclear follow-up homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV, but the flying mouse is not the direct SARS-CoV reserve device.
The philogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV will be to the same group as CoV-HKU4 flying mouse and CoV-HKU5 flying mouse.
CoV-HKU4 flying mouse and MERS-CoV are using the same receptor of the drive, dipeptil dipeptidese-4 (DPP4) to produce viruses.
The effects of the NCB depending on the MERS-CoV virus philogeneticly closer to the effects of the betacoronvirus flying mouse found inside and.
Before this, the wild flying mouse is not on the live MERS-CoV virus.
The nucleotic homology of MERS-CoV and its nearby family CoV-HKU25 flying mouse is only 87 per cent.
That means, flying mouse could not be directly reserved by MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies on the Middle East showed that one-east stars are seropositive to neutralizing antenders specific to MERS-CoV, as well as big-east wheels in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, the identical virus found in humans, was from the neck of one-larb wheels, which also confirms the role of steels as true MERS-CoV reservators.
It is also necessary to note that the bullets, experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, have been observed by non-significant symptoms, but massive virus distribution.
It is noteworthy that the infected wheels were not only in the respiratory way but also in the pheco-oratic way that is also the main way of the virus in the flying mouse.
However, there are still questions because many cases of a near-east respiratory syndrome have not been contacted with the wheels before symptoms appearing and are probably related to transfers from humans or transfers to non-east channels, including uninstalled species of animals which I are carried out by the MERS-CoV drivers.
The SARS-CoV-2 nucleo-homology corresponds to CoV RaTG13 flying mouse, which is Rhinolophus affinis in the Asian subcountries.
Like in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to sign their parents.
It means that the flying mouse could not be a direct SARS-CoV-2 reserve device if only in the future the same coronavirus of the flying mouse is found.
Previously, the direct animal weighers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among wild species sold and died in the oil market of marine products, with many early cases of COVID-19, which testify about the possibility of transmission from animals.
A few recent studies based on metagenome sequence have concluded that a group of small milk-coated groups, such as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also transfer the parent betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 family stamp.
The effects of the nuclears of these new genes of pangoline coronavirus of 85-92 per cent corresponds to SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also close to RaTG13, and the identity of nuclear follow-up is about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two areas of virus differencing similar to SARS-CoV-2, in a treefilogenet, one of which is closer to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, with the identity of the follow-up of 97.4% of the aminocyl.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shows are more divergence, despite the higher degree of follow-up genealogy.
In the earlier study of the pangolines, also reported the definition of virus counterfeits in tests that were similarly family with SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of collection and manual analyse were applied to obtain the success of the gene, including approximately 86.3 per cent of the full-dimensional virus genocide.
Without prejudice to the possibility of pangolines to be one of the intermediate animal weighers SARS-CoV-2.
However, by the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines, SARS-CoV-2 family, there are no evidence of direct origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is still shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines with SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolution path has not yet been established in the flying mouse, pangolines and other milkwaters.
While the highest homology of follow-up was found in the RDD between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the highest homology of follow-up in the entire gene.
Very theoretically, high comparison between betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 family, and SARS-CoV-2, with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal refers to the recombination of the betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As a mobile power of evolution, the recombination is broadly distributed among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zone origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU are examined in the area of HCoV-229E viruses, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU.
The philogenetic evidence of the fact that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can occur from the muscle coronavirus, while the parent virus of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 is found in the grass.
It was reported that the Coronavirus of flying mouse, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ri® CoV) and found in the North American three-color adshoscope, demonstrates a close family with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E genetically with another muscle coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although it was doubted that its intermediate driver could be also a virgin.
Contemporary knowledge of the animal origin of the coronavirus is set up in figure 1 and in Table 2.
Philogenetic analysis of the evidence of the event of intervisual transmission of HCoV to anamnese.
When around 1890 the interview of HCoV-OC43 virus was translated and people were infected by home animals, a respiratory infection pandemia was registered.
The history of the interview transfer of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alphakoronaviruses of flying mouse were found, nearby-general HCoV-229E.
There is a alphakoronavirus among them.
Data support the primary transmission of virus from a flying person.
First, people, not alphaks, could contact the flying mouse in the common environmental knife.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacs.
Secondly, the alphakoronavirus of flying muscles, HCoV-229E family, is different and unpatogeneous in the flying mouse, while the alphacoronvirus has caused the adverse respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alphakoronavirus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it is possible to exclude the possibility that the alpacs have received alphakoronavirus, the family HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, the muscles are the primary source of human pathogic viruses, including Ebol virus, Nipah virus and Hendra.
Therefore, it is not surprised that flying mouse could try to send people HCoV-229E.
On the other hand, while the alphakoronavirus of the flying mouse could serve the geneous HCoV-229E virus powder, the alpacs and one-arbian wheels could be intermediate drivers that were before human virus, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves as an example of intervisual transmission from flying mouse to one-arb wheels and from one-three wheels to a man.
The evolution of MERS-CoV virus from the flying mouse is by its original identity and then under the following studies.
It is obvious that flying mouse provides a rich powder of viruses for intervisual exchange of geneal frames and intervisual transmissions.
Duration of the guest populations, close interaction and ability to fly, makes the flying mouse "Ideal distributors".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to one-arbs for decades ago.
It is a good adjustment to these wheels that have been converted from the intermediate carrier to a stabil and natural reserve.
The MERS-CoV virus has a very easy disease and is characterized by a very low mutation frequency.
His episode transfer to a person is a accident, and a person remains a stupid mediator of MERS-CoV, since its transfer is not supported.
In contrast to the role of the steel to the MERS-CoV transfer, the role of pangolines, if such, to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In particular, the betacoronavirus of pangolines is highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be the tubs of betacoronvirus, SARS-CoV-2 families, as well as cyber in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, a number of animals have to be confirmed or excluded by the SARS-CoV-2 transmission of an internal virus from animals.
First, flying mouse may be a reserved machine for virus, SARS-CoV-2 family, along with the same SARS-CoV-2.
People can divide the environmental knife with the flying mouse by viewing or dividing the tissues of these animals.
Secondly, pangolines may be one of the intermediate strengthening drivers in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently fallen.
People are injured by the virus through the section of the tush and the use of wild animals' meat.
It is possible that many animals, including homes, are acceptable to SARS-CoV-2.
The investigation of domestic and wild animals on the anticipation is justified.
Third, as indicated above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in the third form that was contacted with flying mouse and pangolines.
The search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Furthermore, three major factors of the virus also contributed to the crossing of intervisual barriers.
In the first place, their high mutation speed in the RNA replication.
In comparison with other viruses with a single RNK, the counterparty of coronavirus mutations may be considered "dead-height" with the average replacement of approximately 10 to 4 replacement per year at one part of 2 depending on the phase of the adaptation of coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have an adjusting exorbibonuclease, which leads to extremely high mutation and weakness and even immorality.
Interessantly, the Nucleoid analogue Remdesivir increases the replication of coronavirus through the inhibition of this exorbibuclease and the RNC depending on polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising instruments against SARS-CoV-2, which must be checked in clinical investigations.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is near to millions of times above than their carriers.
Moreover, the mutation frequency may often be higher if the coronavirus is not sufficiently adjusted to the mediator.
In comparison with SARS-CoV with high mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation frequency is shown below that the higher level of adaptation to people is evident.
This virus is probably already adjusted to another driver close to a person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this will also happen to MERS-CoV, well adjusted to one-arb wheels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that vaccines and antivirus medicines from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose efficiency in the result of the genetic dress.
Second, the large RNA gene in coronavirus leads to more plastic in the genetic mode of mutation and recombination, thus increased the probability of inter-evolutional co-evolution that is eligible for new coronavirus in the presentation of relevant abilities.
This contributes to multiple unity of open white calculations and functions encoded in the direction of 3′ end of the gene.
Thirdly, by means of the unique mechanism of matrice election, the coronavirus is a case and often changes the matrix during the RNA.
During the DNA transcription, the coronavirus in the cartridge, which serves as a mixed device, often occurs.
High-Medological and Subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronavirus.
Philogenetic tests of natural recombination were found as in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as in animal coronavirus such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mouse.
Interactivity of the virus – a carrier for transmission
In addition to the three virus factors above, another key factor for interview is the intermediate communication of virus with the receptor of the mediator.
In this article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates the evidence of the Committee ' s existence in the events of intervisual transmission, the SARS-CoV recombination is made.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV and civils, SARS-CoV is considered to be a rapid adaptation in different drivers, especially that the mutation on the RDD is being sent to be S.
In general, the CSD was S coronavirus interacts with the cell recipient, and the driver's response is intensely electing it.
SARS-CoV is an aminocycle, 318 to 510, in the S1 flag, which is related to an angiotensin-converting farm 2 (APF2) as well as to its correctors.
SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to recognize the APF2 different animal receptors, including muscles, cybers, mouse and ennovised dogs, making an inter-video transmission of virus.
In fact, only 6 aminocil residues were found in the RDD, which were different from human and civilian viruses, and 4 of them were found in a recipient-related motive for interaction with the APF2 recipient.
SARS-CoV cities have mutations of K479N and S487T in the RDD, which can increase the interaction of the ship-visual besides the APF2 recipient.
In other words, these two replacements of aminocytos may be important to adapt virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in Segment S1 be—S results in the change of the responsibility of S to the APPF2.
In fact, the investigation using the cryptoelectron microscope says that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times above than between human APF2 and SARS-CoV virus S.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other correctors need to be transferred to SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprised that HCoV-NL63 also relates to APF2, but with the other section was S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amnopeptidese N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetil acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adjustment of these coronavirs in humans after interview of animals.
In addition to cell recipients, the HCoV interview is also managed by other factors of dependence and employment.
The divergence of these white weapons between humans and natural HCoVs reserves, such as flying mouse, single-arbian wheels and glasses, may be a barrier for intervisual transmission.
For successful intervisual transfer to HCoV viruss, dependency factors should be susurbed and supported by the restructuring factors of the carrier.
In this regard, the determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to define and category.
Good results may provide a full-free record of the dependencies and recycling of the SARS-CoV-2 drives using the newer CRISPR technology.
Return of new HCoV: back to zero mark
The diversity of the muscle muscle coronavirus creates wide opportunities for new HCoVs.
In this regard, the coronavirus of flying mouse is a genetic pull for HCoV.
Furthermore, the rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also enhanced by the HCoV evolution force and serve two important steps in this process.
For example, the obtaining or loss of new genes, which encoding whites, has a potential for radical mode of virus phenotips.
The SARS-CoV accessoric whites are important to adapt people to ORF8, since the muscle viruss, SARS-CoV family, were isolated, but it was established that they encodified different ORF8.
A 29-nucleotide delegation characterised for the SARS-CoV coronavirus was found in the stages isolated at the beginning of the epidemic.
This delegation divides ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that has a change in the carrier.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a story of recombinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus, where the RNA depending on polymerase was determined by a large number of smaller recombinant parts.
Recombinations were also defined in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
It was also shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV had been subject to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-arbs in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs were recombined with other animal coronavirus in their nest genes.
It is also necessary to be warned that the experimental selection can contribute to non-determined changes in virus genes, which, mostly, results from the release of virus from the selective pressures, such as the immune system of the driver.
The example of these effects is the loss of full-dimensional ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototypic stage through the two-nucleotide delegation.
While an intake ORF4 calculation framework can be observed by the muscle and the wheel viruss of the HCoV-229E family, the alphakoronavirus shows a single-nucleotic insertion that leads to the movement of the frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs has also been expressed by the pressure of the selection on their reservators.
In the infection of the muscle muscle muscles, the symptoms expressed were recorded, or their absence, which refers to the mutual adjustment between the coronavirus and the flying mouse.
Anatomically and physiologically flying mouse was well adjusted to the coronavirus.
For example, the deficiencies of the activation of the response in the flying mouse are effectively reduced by the pathology of coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of the killer cells in the flying mouse has been decreased by the adjustment of the inhibitor of natural kill-cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of the molecular expression of the primary complex of the gas compatibility of class I.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen forms, which provides a high metabolic of flying mouse activity, can increase the coronavirus replication, at the same time affecting the calculation of exozybonuclease, thus create the pressure of the selection to generate virus stamps that are highly pathogeneous in the new driver.
More patogenic coronavirs can also develop by recombination that leads to the adjustment of new whites or properties of the carrier.
Thus, it is not unfortunate that three new human coronavirus appeared in the last twenty years.
Coronaviruses are unpatogeneous or are providing symptoms in their reservators, such as mouse or wheels.
They are probably replied without a strong immune response to the driver.
It contains a secret of why we see the unsensitive carriers, and that causes serious cases of the Infection.
Easy symptoms are mainly with hyper’s immune reaction and cytokinous storm, where more immune reactions are, the seriouser damage of the population.
Instead, the immune response is not associated with the replication of the coronavirus.
At the same time, immune reactions may have a pleasant effect on therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
The flying mouse is especially a strong interferon response.
Thus, by taking type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, people should have a positive effect.
Moreover, the NLRP3-inflammasome is increasing in the flying mouse.
Inhibition of NLRP3-inflamasome with MCC950 may be made in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 should be the common scheme for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the betacoronavirus of flying muscles was found, the nucleotide homology of 95 per cent corresponds to SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of flying mouse, which is 96 per cent of the SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was discovered that civites and other animals on the market were transferred to virus, the identical SARS-CoVs were not directly established by the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate devices.
Betacoronaviruses of pangoline were detected, particularly homosexual SARS-CoV-2, which says that the pangolines could serve one of the intermediate drivers or that the fragments of the betacoronavirus genes could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created or accidentally.
Coronaviruses have completely focused on SARS-CoV-2 recently.
The investigation of coronavirs in flying muscles and other animals has radically changed our importance of the area of origin and the HCoV animal reserves to the transfer.
Make sure the evidence of the performance showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were flying muscles and were transferred to a person through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection occurs from contacts between people and market civilians, the closure of the markets and civilization could make the end of the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of different lines of betacoronavirus, nearby SARS-CoV-2, pangolines should be removed in order to prevent zone transmission of infections from the product markets.
However, if the SARS-CoV-2 person is transferred through pangolines and other milkwaters, and how this can happen to remain the tasks of future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was long-term at one-arbs.
These wheels serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and fats for the population.
They are broadly spread on the Middle East and on the East.
Therefore, it is not necessary for all the rubbers to control MERS as it was made on the wild animal markets of China to prevent the distribution of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the periodic effort of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to repeat the effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for the infection control in accordance with other measures.
Since we can't remove these viruses, new genotics may be caused by diseases.
In the world, different zone coronavirus are circled.
In particular, there are extremely different coronavirs of flying mouse with a zone potential.
There is a huge role in evolution and recombination of these zone coronavirs, which will lead to the future of new coronavirs, which are mostly transferred and (or) more abilities for humans.
In order to reduce the number of different contacts between humans and animals, it should be rejected from the culture of consumption in wild animals in some areas of China.
After severe trials, which became SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the best preparation and plan of responding to such situations.
In fact, many viruses are on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until the possibility of capture of new territory.
Although many flying muscle properties are pleased to spread viruses, learning to keep people on their side, the possibility of human contact with flying mouse and other kinds of wild animals can be minimised.
To improve the understanding of coronavirs and their natural carriers, a continuous epidemiological monitoring for milk-footers will be used to prevent the transfer of coronavirus from animals and future diseases.
Finally, the most effective way of preventing the virus zone is to keep people away from the environmental nests of natural reserve of zone viruses.
The area of SARS-CoV-2 is still missing.
First of all, if the flying mouse was transferred to the SARS-CoV-2 pangolines, it was interesting to see where the muscles and pangolines divided the same environmental low.
Secondly, if flying mouse plays a more direct role in the transmission of a person, it is necessary to determine how people have been contacted with the flying mouse.
Third, if the role of the true intermediate carrier plays a third milk, it is necessary to determine how it interacts with different species, including humans flying mouse and pangolines.
The end, since many milk, including domestic animals, can be acceptable to SARS-CoV-2, should be carried out as well as at the epidemiological and experimental inspection.
If it is a flying mouse, a pangoline or another milk, it is expected that the SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessors will be defined in their natural carriers in the future.
Further studies in this area will light on the SARS-CoV-2 development path in animals, which will have significant impacts on the profile and control of COVID-19 in humans.
diagnostic criteria need to be updated for “supports of disease” and COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group repeated a short guide for diagnosis and treatment of the new coronaviral infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), in which information on our diagnostics and recommendations for combating this pandemia worldwide are provided.
However, the Coronavirus Infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually on the basis of the current results of the study and experience; thus the diagnostic and the therapeutic area have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we replied on one comment of our recommendations and introduced new diagnostic criteria for "consequences of the disease" and "subsequent cases" in the document "Diagnostic and therapy recommendations for COVID-19" (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which now received the official name of the coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus disease only was called "the heavy respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO quality of COVID-19 as a pandemia.
In order to combat the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our group distorted a short guide and repeated it on the website of the Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This responsibility took great attention to himself.
Let us note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually on the basis of the current results of the study and experience; thus diagnostic and therapeutic area have also been continuously updated.
For example, in the period from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the document “Diagnostic and therapy recommendations for COVID-19” held by the National Health Committee of the CNA (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and the content of some of its provinces have been changed.
Recently, Joe (Zhou) prepared with co-operators had been introduced comments on our recommendations, which contained simple diagnostic suggestions that have already been diagnosed.
This work has added new practical witnesses to our recommendations, as well as a valuable information on this pandemia which has been covered by the whole world.
We confirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, the last issue of the diagnosis and therapy recommendations for COVID-19 (the seventh version) and the results of the current studies, and their work needs to be updated.
In the seventh issue of this document (after 3 March 2020) for a comprehensive analysis in the case of suspiciousness of the disease, one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history of two clinical diseases should be associated:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of preventions or residence in Mr. Uhanh and its surroundings or other population items where the COVID-19 diseases were registered within 14 days prior to the manifestation of symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with diseases infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with local tests based on nuclear oxygen); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or repair symptoms from Mr. Uhana and its surrounding or other population items where the COVID-19 diseases were registered during the last 14 days before the symptoms were shown; (4) the history of contacting with the groups of persons with diseases under therapy (≥ 2 people in the case of the COVID or non-receptor, COVID-19).
Clinical manifestations: (1) High temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external infections of COVID-19; (3) the total number of leacocytes is normal or decreased with reduced number of limfocytes at the early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for the subject of the disease should be based on the case of suspiciousness of one of the points of the pathogenic or serological evidence of the effects, namely: (1) the PCR test in real time is local for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-general sequence of virus shows high homogenity of new coronavirus; (3) the results of serotic results for the SARS-CoV-2 anticipation of IgM and IgG; or the change of the test results of a relatively positive to the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 anticipate IgG; or the increase of the titra at least 4 times at the level of the fashion indicator.
It may also be noted that at the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) issues of the document were added to the PCR tests in real time for nuclear oxygen in respiratory ways or blood tests.
The pathogenic blood test diagnosis was added on the fourth (27 January 2020) and on the five (8 February 2020) issues; then, in the seventh emission, the necessity of serological evidence was added.
These changes are on the results of the continuous work of researchers, seeking the optimal set of nuclear oxygen detection in the rapid diagnosis and the analysis of tests taken from respiratory ways, including the selection of blood tests, which increases the accessibility of different models and contributes to the inclusion of local test results for specific anticipations in the illness criteria.
However, more evidence is needed to show caution when treating patients with apatic symptom and patients without expressed symptoms.
Thus, the road card presented in the Jou (Zhou) and Dr., should be updated, since it has no clinical symptoms, is classified as a ‘low risk’ group.
The system also requires accuracy in carrying out a further clone of research and research.
We conclude that we hope to receive more preliminary evidence and invite readers to leave our comments.
In the diagnosis of "consequences of suspicion" and "under the cases", we will make readers follow and apply the last recommendations given in the countries where they live.
Our group will also now update its recommendations in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new cases resulting from COVID-19-day ma
Bangladesh confirmed five new cases in the result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the biggest number of viruss per day.
On yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute reported that in the number of registered cases of infection were 114 current cases, as well as 33 health of the patients who were home.
It was registered by 17.
In the online Britain, IEDCR Director, Dr. Midjabi Sabrina Flora race, that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Midjabi, two ended in the age of 60, two of 51 to 60 years, and one of 41 to 50 years.
She also reported that two dead were from Dakka.
On 11 March, World Health (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemia.
The Clinic partner reported to the Anadol news agency that one of the dead was Jalall Siphur Rachman, director of the Bengalian Anticorruption Commission at the Kuwait Clinic of Matthew.
On Saturday, the Ministry of Car Transport and Bangladesh Mountains stated that the public transport work would be suspended for a longer time than the plan was, in particular, until the Sabbath.
The work of public transport was stopped since 26 March and was to be renewed on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of goods for the first need — medicines, fuel and food products — was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March in two persons returned from Italy, as well as women of one of them.
On 19 March, these three people have been healthy.
SARS-CoV-2 overseer has a million infection cases throughout the world
According to the University of Johns Hopkins, the total number of cases of coronaviral infection of SARS-CoV-2 overall over the world have increased one million.
COVID-19's coronavirus killed at least 52 thousand people.
Ruby was the same day when Malawi was in the first case of infection, and the first case of the coronavirus was fixed in Zambia.
Northern Korea claimed that, on Thursday, it was one of the few countries in which the infection of coronaviral infection was not fixed.
In the event of yesterday, the World Health reported about 1 051 635 in cases of infection, including 79 332 cases in twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 at the central time (0800 UTC) 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244.000 cases of infection were registered by coronavirus, from which at least 5.900 had an aerodrome.
CBS News with data from the University of Johns Hopkins reported that in the United States, more than 1000 of the coronaviral infections were fixed in the middle of the United States.
The countries throughout the world have announced the adoption of measures to prevent the distribution of diseases.
On Thursday, Mr. Moscow Sergei Sobianin extended the state of self-isolation of citizens by 1 May.
Previous President Vladimir Putin stated that growth throughout the country, despite self-isolation, would be received for a period of 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for the prolongation of the emergency position for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes for, ten abstentions and one vote " opposite".
Saudi Arabia extended a time of command in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the earlier commanding hour was only three hours to the morning.
Thailand's plan is to introduce a comment hour from 10 hours a.m. to fourth morning.
The Governor of the State of Ohio, Mike Davein, announced that the self-isolation regime on the country's territory was extended by an offer until 1 May.
The magazines in Australia have a number of toilet paper packagings that can be obtained once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian magazines Woolselfths and Coles decreased the number of toilet paper packages that could be obtained once in all the country's stores, to two and one packaging respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also made a package.
These reports were reported in cases and on Facebook web pages.
As reported, the citizens began to make extreme reserves because of the assurance that COVID-19 could be able to introduce a general self-isolation regime.
In the middle of the Wool ́ths network, the number of buyed toilet papers before one packaging.
Earlier, 4 and 5 March, Woolselfths and Coles have already packaging this number of 4 packages.
Coles’s trade network in its press relief of 8 March reported that by introducing four packages “in many toilet paper stores still too quickly for a time”, it called such a question “before-president”, while ALDI in Facebook post, on Monday, called such a tend “unexpected”.
According to the Representative of Wool—ths, the last week was observed by a rare increase in sales.
Magazine Costco, in Canberre last week, also made this number of two packages.
In order to fulfil the deficit, Coles started to order the suppliers more larger party and increased the frequency of the supply, Wool ́ths added to the party, while ALDI has made reserves for the previous sale in the middle.
Russell Zimmerman, the Executive Director of the Australian Association of Employers, reported that the stakeholders are trying to fill the reserves, but this is a delay in relation to the employment of the authorities in relation to the distribution of car rental cars.
He expects the increase in self-determination of the product, since suppliers are trying to satisfy the question, but there are less favourable proposals.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to the exhaustion of stocks, some magazines cannot carry out environmental action.
In News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a different trade expert from the Queensland Technology University, told that the stores are filling stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a gross goods, so the number of stock stocks is small, and after the total sale of the goods, the long range of pounds remains empty, strengthening the feeling of the deficiency of stocks.
“Coles and Woolities believe that if the pools were able to be filled, and the goods such as the rounds of the toilet paper and the disabilities for hands could be placed on these fields in large quantities, the purchasers would probably not be panic”, says Russell Cimerman.
In the past environment, the manufacturer of the translated toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported the storage of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Toilet paper manufacturer Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also manufacturing the Sorbent marking goods, reported that they work around to ensure sufficient quantities of goods.
Domain.com, the sale site of insurance, reported that when the number of auktions in Melbourne was reduced because of the lack of purchasers at the week of workday, some sellers of insurance began to make the first parts of the auction free toilet paper.
The fourth edition of the NT News each day printed in Darwin included a tab of eight pages intended to break and use as a toilet paper.
According to the ABC, of 3 March, the stores have not been introduced to the number of goods obtained by claiming that they are not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also used by a higher question, including medical masks, dezinficiating means for hands, galandary, brain- and muckles.
In addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening, Ocado was noted that the online store of the British Supermarket Ocado also sold the toilet paper of Andres with two packagings of 12 rolls.
World Health Declares the COVID-19 pandemia
In the Middle of World Health (WHO), the COVID-19 infection pandemia called SARS-CoV-2 was announced.
Although the term “pandemia” is only the size of disease, not the risk of specific cases, the WHO notes that the Governments of the countries need to take measures:
“All countries are still able to affect the development of the Pandemia.”
This is possible if the countries are being carried out by detection, testing, treatment, isolation of disease, follow-up of cases of disease and mobilization of their citizens,” explained Mr. Tedros Addan Hebreisus.
“We are deeply concerned with the threatening level of spread and seriousness of disease as well as the threatening level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Friden, former Officer of the United States Centres for Control and Profile of Disabilities, this Pandemia is "before-president".
In his interview translated by CNN in February, he said that “no one of the other respiratory viruss other than the grip has been followed from the time of its arrival to an uninterrupted global distribution”.
Mr. Gebreisus expressed an analogue point of view, saying, "We have never observed the pandemies of the coronavirus.
We have never seen a pandemia that can be controlled before.’
In January, the WHO announced the emergency of the emergency situation in the field of public health, which is international and then granted her a new status of pandemia.
The Director of the National Institute of Alergia and Infections of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fawich, said: "This is just the beginning, it will be worse."
According to the present Press on Thursday in the world, at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 disease were registered, more than 4 600 people ended.
Coronavirus Pandemia 2019-2020 is the current place of the coronaviral disease pandemia 2019 (COVID-19), which is called for a heavy respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The success was discovered in Uhana, China, December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 the emergency situation of international significance in the field of public health, which was then recognised by the Pandemy on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 disease were registered in 210 countries and regions, which resulted in the death of approximately 97,000 people.
Approximately 364 000 people have been healed.
The level of ability in China consists of 4 per cent, while it varies from 13,04 per cent in Algeria to 0,08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most exposed symptoms include the disorder, the hedge, and the distressed breath.
It is related to the complexity of pneumonia and the intense respiratory distress-syndrome.
Since the first symptoms have been shown to the sickness, it is usually about five days, but it can also be varied from two to fourteen days.
Therapy is currently not found in vaccine or specific.
Basic treatment has a symbolic and supporting character. Recommended profilatic measures include the weight of hands, the covering of the mouth, the monitoring of the distance between people, the detection and self-isolation of people who doubt their infection.
Government throughout the world reacts to the situation by introducing railways, corantine measures, commanding hour, control of the risks in slave areas and closing different objects.
The Pandemia led to serious global economic consequences, transfer or cancellation of religious, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as to a widely distributed deficiency of goods to be lost by panical purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, which had reached approximately 99.4 per cent of worldwide students.
On the Internet, the design of virus was spread, the case of xenophobia and discrimination against the citizens of China, other citizens of East and Southeast Asia, or those who remind them of the external and other groups of people in the areas where the cases are marked by the distribution of virus.
As a result of the reduction of poez and the closement of a weak industrial undertakings, the air pollution and emissions were reduced at the birth.
On 31 December 2019, the healthcare bodies of the city of Uhan (100 Province of Hubai), China reported that the emergency of emergency cases was not caused, and at the beginning of January 2020 the situation was initiated.
The cases of infection, mainly, have been marked with the optical market of Juanan products, so the virus, as they think, has a zone origin.
The virus, who called the illness, is like SARS-CoV-2. This is a recently open virus with a large comparison with the muscles, the pangolin coronavirus and the SARS-CoV coronavirus. Later was found that the first case of illness occurred on 1 December 2019, and the infection did not visit the market after that date.
Two third cases of infection registered in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the report Morning Post, which was not checked, was stated that the 55-year-old resident of the Province of Hubai on 17 November 2019, was the WHO reported that the number of new infections in China was decreased, but was unexpectedly growing in Italy, Irania and South Korea, and the number of new cases of infection in China's areas was the first number of new cases of infection in China.
The number of cases of disease may be decreased, in particular because of cases with symptoms expressed.
On 26 February, a few cases of infringement were registered among youths, while patients with less than 2,4 per cent of cases in the world. The main scientific adviser of the United Kingdom of Patrick Valans underscored that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before the establishment of an effective group immunity of the population of the country.
Statistics include infections of people who were checked on COVID-19 and whose test was demonstrated to locally official protocols.
On 23 March, no country was able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy was adopted that would not be tested on the evidence of unemployed symptoms.
The study held on 16 March showed that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not found in China until 23 January, and that such unregistered persons were a source of infection for 79% of registered cases.
The statistical analysis reported on 30 March showed that the number of cases of infection in Italy had increased significantly the number of cases registered.
Earlier, the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) from COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
In the investigation of the United States control and profile of diseases, this indicator may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well-healing.
In other, more complex cases, from the beginning of the development of symptoms to the time of death, the most common time of 14 days was between 6 and 41 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 of the COVID-19 were held.
In China, at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of the cases were more than 60 years old, and 75 per cent of the dead had associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The Office of the COVID-19 pandemia reports usually include information on patients with local results of COVID testing.
The fact that the quantity of the COVID-19 can be much above, since the Office of Digits may not take account of the dead persons that have not been tested — for example, in the case of death, in the older houses, etc.
Incomplete data in Italy testify that the number of →s during the pandemia has exceeded the COVID indicator of 4 to 5 times.
The press secretary of the United States Centres on Control and Profile of illness (CDC) admits: "We know that [declared number of dead] below the fact." Its words are confirmed by the reports on some unique cases in the United States. The incomplete account of non-complete data is often met in pandemies such as the epidemy of the Svine Grippe H1N1 2009. The first dead was registered in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death after the parts of China was registered on the Philippines on 1 February, and in the regions of Asia, in France, on 14 February.
On 28 February, more than a decade was registered in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions in all continents, except Antarka, reported the cases of death.
All indicators are distinguished depending on the region and the time of the distribution of diseases; they also affect testing volumes, the quality of health systems in the treatment schemes, the start of disease and population parameters, such as age, half and general health.
According to the statistical data of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global quantity of ≥ 6,0% (97 039/1 617 204) has been established by the University of Jones Hopkins.
Data on different regions are different.
In China, the proportionality of disease was decreased from 17.3% (for those who have symptoms appeared on 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who have symptoms appeared after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of ≥ 1% of disease resulting (CFR) as a percentage of diagnosed patients died from disease and the rate of IFR, which reflects the percentage of infected (as diagnosed and non-diagnosed) patients died from disease.
These statistical data are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of the infringement to the end of the disease.
Scientists were trying to calculate these indicators on specific groups of people.
According to the evaluation of the Centre of Medicination of the University of Oxford, the level of kvalitet from this pandemia is totally from 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The top number of this area is resulted in the first test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as in the statistical study that analyses the impact of the test on the CFR.
The WHO claims that the current pandemia can be controlled.
Peak and the precise duration of the suspension are not defined and may be different from the location.
Macey Bonnie, the Penn’vania University, states that “uncontrolled infectional insufficiencies are normally out of charge, and then, when the number of available illness facilities is finished, they begin to gain.
However, in the present situation it is not practically able to make any proof about when this happens.’
An elder of the Chinese medical adviser, June Nanjun, states that “all can end until June” if all countries are able to carry out and implement the WHO recommendations to prevent the distribution of virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski from the London Hygiene School and the Trop of Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 “should be cycled for a year or two”.
According to the investigation carried out by the Imperial College under Nile Ferguson, “to the time until vaccine is created (18 months or more)”, it is necessary to comply with the physical distantization measures and other measures.
William Shaffner, the University of Vanderbilt, believes: "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear, because it is so easy to be translated" and that it can "convert to seasonal illness every year."
The virtuality of new successes will depend on collective immunity and mutation levels.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be extremely inspective, and some infected people can have disease without symptoms.
Two most distributed symptoms are an increased temperature (88 per cent) and sugar (68 per cent).
Less exposed symptoms include obscurity, education of mocrotics in the spirits (slides), loss of disorders, muscle pain, muscle and ingredients, pain in the throat, disease, disorder, fluid, diarrhoea or cyanase. WHO states that it is a serious form of disease with the development of respiratory problems about each six person.
The United States control and profile of illness (CDC) calculates immediate symptoms such as respiration, persistent pain or feeling of injury in the breast, immediately feeling of consciousness, distressing and disturbance. In the case of these symptoms, they should immediately be addressed for medical assistance. The further development of the disease may lead to a serious disturbance, a heavy distress-syndrome, sepsis, shock and death.
Some infected people may be ill without any clinical evidence, but the results of the analysis confirm the fact of infection, therefore, doctors recommend that persons who are in close contact with patients who are diagnosed under diagnosis, under extreme control, and to investigate the subject of infection.
Assessed by Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsimptomatic rate of disease are collected from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (in time between incidence and symptoms) is collected from one to 14 days; it usually counts five days; it has not been full of clearness on the symptom loss: the percentage of patients with COVID-19 developing this symptom was significantly 30% and then falled up to 15%.
There is still no detail on how to spread the disease.
It is considered that the disease is primarily transmitted during the close contact, as well as through small capsules, splits in the air together with ≥ 3 to 6 feet; the contact is submitted in the radius from 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies in the open caps may be extended from 4,5 meters (15 feet) to 8,2 metres (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be translated through small capsules in the air, which can be able to remain in the air for longer time.
The capsules can fall into the mouth or the nose of the neighbors, as well as in the narrow.
Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiovascular reanimation (CRL) can lead to the spread of exhaust products and, therefore, to spread the virus in the air.
He may also be in the body if a person is injured by a threatened surface, including the skin, with the following touch to his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also dangers that the virus can be translated through an efficiency, but the risk of transmission is deemed to be low.
The Government of China refuses the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 feeally-oral transfer. The virus is most infected during the first three days after the symptoms have occurred, although its distribution can occur as well as at the lighter stages of disease.
There were cases when the tests were shown locally in testing for three days before the symptoms appeared, and this is about the possibility of transmission of virus to the manifestation of symptoms.
There are only a few reports on the laboratory in the cases of unsimptomous disease fluid, but in some countries, contact investigations were also detected in cases of transmission of illness from unsimptom carriers.
The collaborators of the Centre of Protection and Control of Disabilities (ECDC) claim that it is not clearly clear how easy the virus is spread, however, that one of the diseases usually affects 2 to 3 other people. The virus is able to survive from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylen) and on the non-governmental station (304) virus is able to live until three days, on the carton surface — for one day, and on the cold surfaces to 4 hours.
These data are, however, varied depending on poverty and temperature, and there was a positive result of the COVID-19 homes and other animals.
There is no evidence of the fact that animals can transmit the virus to people, although the British authorities advise their hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contacting other surfaces to which infected people could be touched.
A hard-respiratory coronavir syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus found first in three persons with a pneumonia from a group with anxious respiratory disease registered in Uhana.
All the characters of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are in nature in family coronavirus. Without the body of the body, the virus can be made using a bite-shirt that produces its protective cloud. SARS-CoV-2 has a large comparison with the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is supposed to have a zone origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it was geneticly classified with the kind of Betacoronavirus, Sarbecovirus (cellular line B) together with two other fluid muscle viruses.
At a total-genomic level, he is 96% identical to other muscle-flight coronavir (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese investigators discovered that there was only one difference in a number of parts of the follow-up of the pangoline and human virus geneome.
The total genocide comparison of today showed that the largest percentage of similarity (92 per cent) is between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but it is not enough to prove that the pangolines are intermediate virus hosts.
The incidence of the virus may be diagnosed pre-diagnosed on symptoms, although it should finally be confirmed using the analysis of the polimer-speed reaction with the reverse transcription of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of the investigation compared to the methods of the CCP and CCT used in Uhana showed that the CCT is significantly more sensitive than the CCP, even less specific, since many of its visualization functions correspond to other infections and processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radio College reported the recommendation “no use of the CT for Skrining or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnosis”.
The WHO was identified by several SARS-CoV-2 test protocols, and the first of them was held on 17 January.
A test is carried out on the real-time polymerate reaction (RT-CPC).
It can be conducted on the spirit tests and on the blood models.
Results are usually ready for several hours to several days.
The test is usually used by a nosalocate brain, even though it can be used from the zea. A variety of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that allow an anticipate to detect.
On 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to receive approval for all applications.
In the United States, the serological test, once Cellex was approved for use in extra cases only by certificated laboratories.
The characteristic characteristics of the visualization of the symptoms on the raingenograms and the computer tomography (KT) are related to asymmetric periferic detentions on the type of mathematic glass and the lack of plural exhausts.
It is the Italian radiolog of the community to be established by the international photo-base under the cases of impression.
As a result of the comparison with other infections such as adonovirus, with COVID-19 photos, not under CCR tests, have a clinical specification.
In China there was a major study that compared the results of the CCT cell and the testing of the CCR, and it was clear that, although the photos were less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted quickly; they were more sensitive, and thus this diagnostic method could be considered as a tool for screening in infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using the rentgenogram and the computer tomography, neurological networks were distributed on the basis of experienced intellectual.
Strategy for the prevention of disease transmission includes maintenance of personal hygiene, arms, disturbance of the eyes, nose or mouth with disturbing hands, use of the oval or shipping of salfets that should be cut off after the use.
Those who may have been infected should be dressed by the medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transfer of diseases, it is also recommended to be physically distorted from people, and many Governments recommend to keep away from any untimely movement to countries and areas suffering from insufficiency, and to promote the movement of citizens.
However, the virus of smoke is spread into most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread between the population, some members who do not know where and how they have been infected. The medical agents who care for patients who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, as well as the precautionary measures for contacting other people and the protection of the eyes. The monitoring of contacts is also a important method used by healthcare bodies to determine the source of infection and prevent its further distribution.
The exercise of data to citizens by means of their mobile phones for this purpose has expressed confidence in respect of confidentiality and such organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International), as well as more than 100 other organizations, with statements required for human monitoring.
Different mobile applications were designed and proposed for voluntary use; at 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups worked over the solutions that provide personal data confidentiality — such as the registration of user's closeness to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the user of the phone was in close contact with the person whose test on COVID-19 was local, he receives the corresponding notification, and there are also unusual versions of how to prevent the injury — such as the nose and the mouth, which actually is ineffective.
COVID-19 vaccine does not exist at this time, although organizations work on its creation.
It is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC (Center of control and profile of illness) also recommends more frequently to smile hands and water during at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or when heavy arms are threatened, as well as before eating, after smoking, oval or chicken.
This is needed, since the virus is outside the body of the vial, which covers its protective shelter.
Furthermore, if weapons and water are not available, the CDC recommends to use and use dezinfectation instruments in order to put hands on a sphere content at least 60%.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching the eyes, the nose or the mouth with the arms.
The surfaces may be infected with a number of solutions (in the surface of the non-governmental dezinfiction means begins to carry out a minute after the introduction) with the content of 62-71% of the tenol, 50-100% of the isopanole, 0.1% of the natrium hypochloride, 0.5% of the water transfusion and 0.2-7.5% of the powder-yode.
Other components, such as benzalconia chloride and gluconate chloride, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the case of suspiciousness of COVID or its submission in the establishment, such as office or daily stationary, all the spaces of such areas, including offices, toilets, general dealing, electronic equipment such as plans, sensor screens, keyboard, distant management and bankomates, the destination of diseases.
Medicinal organizations recommend to cover the mouth and the nose of the lock or the sulphet and immediately to cut out the hygiene objects used.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use medical masks, since the use of the mask can result in the amount and area of the spread of exhaust products that are spent in the air, the chickeny and the oval.
The WHO also issued the information on how and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virus of the University of Lids, “the medical masking may decrease the decline of people to cut them up, and the touching to the face is the main way of infecting.” The masks are also recommended to use those who are injured for people who may be infected.
The WHO recommends that healthy people carry medical masks only if they are highly risked, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognises that the use of the mask actually allows to reduce the number of touches to the face.
Some countries began to call for the use of medical masks in public areas.
The CDC, the United States, recommends to carry out the ne-medicin non-medicin masks. China has highlighted the importance of use of single health masks of health, especially if they are in close contact (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
In Hong Kong it is recommended to carry out a medical mask in public transport or in human areas.
The Tayland health factors call people to prepare face teases in home conditions and remove them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited citizens to go out on the street without a mask closing nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Vietnam turned to all citizens with a request to carry out masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria committed all the visitors of the product stores to provide medical masks.

On 1 April in Taiwan, from middle of March, ten million medical masks per day, it was prescribed and used medical masks for all passengers in trains and intergovernmental buses.
The inhabitants in Panama have been binding to carry out a medical mask in the street; the people who cannot receive the mask were recommended to throw them in home conditions.
Medical masks are also used by Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (a.k.a. the distantization) is a measures to combat infection that are aimed at distorting disease by minimizing intense contacts between people.
Protection measures relate to the care, traveling, closing schools, slaves, stadiums, theatres and trade centers.
People can use distantization measures by staying home, avoiding humans, using uncontakt welcomes and physically distant from others.
Many Regional Governments, especially highly suffering from insufficiency, are currently prescribed or recommended to displacement.
The significant number of people, which could be collected in one of the recommendations of the Governing Bodies of the United States and Health Organizations, was operatively reduced by 250 people (in regions where there were no data on the distribution of COVID-19), up to 50 people and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the collection of groups including more than two persons. Age people and § suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension and deteriorated immune systems are increasingly risked to disease virus in serious forms. CDC recommends them how longer to stay in the region if the disease is observed. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other healthcare bodies began to replace the use of the term “social distance” to “social distance”, so that the objective of this measure is to reduce physical contacts in the context of the situations of the OS and other healthcares.
The term "social distantification" was thus understood that humans should be subject to full isolation, rather than to remain in contact with other people in alternative ways.
Among the other, recommendations were given to enter into sex only with your permanent partners with whom you are living and in whom you are sure he has no virus and his symptoms.
COVID-19 persons with diagnosis and those who understood that they were infected, self-isolation is recommended in home conditions.
Detailed and suitable self-isolation policies, and the governments of many countries also committed a commitment or recommended to all the population of the areas of suffering self-employed.
The faces of high risk groups were prescribed by the highest coratin.
Persons who may have been contacted with COVID-19 or recently visited the country or region, at a significant level of the epidemic, have been recommended to find the carantine for 14 days since the last possible contact.
The strategy of combating the emergency includes the maintenance of the distribution of diseases, deterioration or disturbance.
The maintenance of the disease is carried out at early stages and is aimed at investigating and isolating the infected and other measures for infection control and vaccination in order to remain in the expansion of disease among the rest of the population.
At the stage, when the expansion of the disease is not long-quality, efforts are made to reduce the consequences: measures aimed at distorting and reducing the impact of the epidemic on the health and society system.
The measures to maintain and reduce the consequences of the distribution of diseases can be taken at the same time.
The increase in the infection requires more extreme measures to restore the pandemia, reducing the basic number of infection cases to the level below 1. The part of the infection injury efforts aimed at reducing the epidemic pick as the equation of the epidemy.
Such efforts reduce the risk of prevention of healthcare services and provide more time for vaccine and treatment methods.
Inflational interactions that can be helped to cope with effort include measures of personal identity such as hygiene, use of medical mass and selfisolation; public measures aimed at distantization, such as closure of school and refusal of mass operations; community's involvement in the development of such measures and participation in them; and measures for the protection of the environment, such as the cleaning of the tops. After serious efforts became evident in China, there were more determined measures aimed at maintaining effort, such as the isolation of cities and the introduction of extreme reductions.
Other countries also adopted a number of measures aimed at the distribution of virus.
In South Korea, a mass scanning and localised coratins, as well as the organization of the system of advertising on the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided by self-isolation insufficients and higher steps to those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and scraff was increased for the capture of emergency medicines. The modeling in the United Kingdom and the United States showed that there is serious problems with regard to the disturbance (but not with the extent of the expansion) and the reduction (restauration of the epidemic growth).
The optimal policy to reduce the impact of the distribution of diseases may reduce the severe charge of health system to 2/3, and the duality is double, but it is still leading to hundreds of thousands and collapses of health systems.
It may be a preferred method, but it is necessary to be used until the virus is circled between the population (or until the rate of vaccine will be repeated, if it happens before), because, in the other case, the distribution of disease will be repeated when the measures will be weak.
A long-term involvement in the promotion of the pandemia leads to economic and economic expenditure.
The antiviral medicines approved for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently not available but are taken into force for their time, including testing of medicinal products.
If you take non-receptural medicines from prostitute, drinking adequate quantity of hepatitis and relaxation can help to facilitate symptoms.
Depending on the disease of the patient, oxygen treatment, intravenous instruction and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroid medicinal products can only be used.
A number of associations previously approved for treatment of other virus diseases are also considered to be used for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic means” can facilitate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO considers the increase in potential and health adjustment to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a major response to the emergency of disease.
• The ECDC and the Regional OS Office have issued ruling principles for clinical and primary health assistance in order to contribute to re-distribution of resources at several levels, including concentration of laboratory services on testing on COVID-19, distortion of untime procedures, where possible, detection of virus and isolation of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as extension of intensive therapy through training of personal and increased numbers of available IVL and coke devices.

The 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus testing laboratory includes the methods of detecting virus presence and the methods of detection of an antichange produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the models is confirmed by the OCT-PCR, which recognises the RNC of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and only intended to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to submit enough recent or active infections.
The detection of anger (serology) can be applied for diagnosis and for the purposes of population control.
Anthony analyses discover the number of people who have been affected by disease, including those whose symptoms were too significant to go to the hospital or have been missing.
The precise level of kvalitet of this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of this test.
In March 2020, no reliable data on the proliferation of virus was found in any country because of testing.
On 23 March, no country could check more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in different countries was totally opposed.
Such differences in information are probably strictly affected by the registered indicators of employment, which may be significantly increased in some countries.
The test can be carried out in tests from the respiratory ways received by different ways, including the nosolocate mosque or the model of mocrotics, by means of a polymer-PCR back transcription in real time.
Results are usually available for several hours to two days.
The OIT-PCR test conducted on the fats taken from the throat only during the first week of illness.
Later, the virus can be disappeared from the throat, and it can continue to be multiplied.
Infected patients tested for the second week of illness as alternative may be taken from the bottom of respiratory paths using a decaying category, or use of decreasing products (mocrote).
One of the early tests of the CCP was carried out in the Sharate Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using the Polymeramitical Reaction with Reverse Transcription (RRT-PCR) and on the basis of 250 000 sets that later spread the World Health Protection (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also extended its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kcoubiotech has set up a set to find SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the PCR of the Clinity Level (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It describes gen E, common for all beta coronavirus, and gen RdRp, specific for SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies, received the authorisation of the National Medicinal Management of China for External use of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the CCP. In the United States, the Centre for Control and Profile of Disturbance (CDC) extends the International Reagent Resource’s diagnostic panel for the real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in the laboratory of public health.
One of the three genetic tests of older testing versions issued incomplete results due to the wedded reactions and the low range of the CDC tests conducted in Atlanta, resulting in a middle of 100 tests per day during the entire February of 2020.
The tests used by two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date, the public and employment laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Supervisory Office for Food Quality and Medicinal Products in the context of extreme applications. The United States Common Laboratories began testing at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 on the basis of RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantities have been stated; the compilation and analysis should be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was spread and produced by the State Research Centre of Virus and Biotechnology "VECTOR".
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, the COVID-19, 13 March 2020, was reported that the COVID-13, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for the use of a test that could be performed during 3.5 hours in a large range of tests that allowed the car to solve about 4128 tests for 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an external authorisation for the use of Abbott Laboratories (EUA) to perform the tests of the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued such authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA for a trial of approximately 45 minutes.
FDA also approved the test in which the PCR is used by the ampli technologies of the isothermic nuclear acid.
Since the test does not require a series of temperature temperature, this method can discover the results in only five minutes and the refuses in 13 minutes.
It is currently considered about 18,000 such machines, and Abbott plans to increase production up to 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is currently developed using a monoklonal anticipate, which is specifically related to the new coronavirus (N-Belk), and hopes to get results within 15-20 minutes, like the grip test.
In the review of the specialized literature for March 2020, the conclusion is that “brown cell ringograms have a small diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] may have such value even before the symptoms appearing”.
The typical characteristics found in the KT chode include double-sub-wraw multiplying with periferic, asymetrical and aposterial distribution.
Sub-regional domination, the symptom of bully pool and consolidation are developed as a result of the progress of the disease.
The results of the studies compared to the methods of the CCP and CCT used in Uhan at the present pandemia showed that the CCT is significantly more sensitive than the CCP, even less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for disturbance and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radio College has approved the recommendation of “no use of the CT for Skrining or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnosis”. In March 2020, the CDC initial scrining recommends and uses the CCR method.
Partly immune response to infection is expressed in you, including IgM and IgG.
These anticipations can be used to detect human infections after 7th day, to identify immunity and to carry out popular controls.
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses are able to perform high production of car systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed of each such system.
In C25, one pattern of blood peripheral is usually used, although serious samples can be applied to immune response.
In PoCT, one blood pattern is usually obtained by the roof of each cover.
On the contrary to the methods of the CCP, the stage of bleeding for an analysis is not required. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all registration procedures and now can extend their tests to antenates.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received only one test for external application.
The testing production consists of hundreds of models during several hours and thus works much more rapidly than the normal CCP-analyse of the virus NCB.
At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom found that no of the anthony analysis sets out for an antenate results.
In Hong Kong there was a scheme that allows patients to stay home with a suspicion for the virus: "Cooperation of non-relevant assistance before the patient is a patent', the patient flees in it, returns and receives the results of the test. The British NHS announced the start of its pilot test scheme in cases of suspicious cases, which eliminates the risk of infection by other clinician visitors, or needs to determine the short-term machine if it was available to carry out the patient. In some cases, the COVID-19 testing test has been reported in the suspicious cases of the medical analysis, using all relevant precaution.
The testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and largest test procedures than in any other country. On 2 March, the National Association of Medical Insurance Medical Medicines stated that it was ready to conduct about 12 000 tests daily in ambulator conditions and that they could only be made 10 700 tests a week ago.
If the investigation is appointed by a doctor, the expenditure is covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Institute of Robert Koha, the general production of Germany in the testing plan consists of 160 000 tests per week.
In the 19th March, the test test was carried out in several major cities.
At 26 March 2020, the total number of tests made in Germany was not, since only results were registered.
The first laboratory study showed that in the calendar week 12/2020 of SARS-CoV-2, a total complexity of 483 295 analysis was taken up to week 12/2020, including 33 491 model (6.9%) and the result was local. The researchers of the Israeli clinic Technion and Rambam Hospital were assembled and used the method of simultaneously testing models taken by 64 patients, the model unit and further analysis only if the combined model showed a positive result. In Uhan 5 February 2020, the BGI was opened in the 2000 kv timely laboratorium.
The building of this laboratory was organized by the BGI Van Csan and was completed in only 5 days; the modeling showed that if this laboratory had not been introduced in an exploiting in such a manner, there would be 47 per cent of the illnesses in Hubai and, respectively, the costs of the coratin would also be two times above.
The Laboratories in Uhan were opened in Shanghai, Tanzina, Pekina and Shanghai, in general in 12 cities of China.
By 4 March 2020, the total performance ability indicators were 50.000 tests per day. The Origami Assays multiples were issued, which could test up to 1 122 patients' analysis on COVID19 with only 93 intervals. These balanced co-operations may work in small labs, excluding the need to use robotized hydrogen manipulators.
On March, with regard to the lack of and insufficient number of reactions, the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States have been a problem with mass testing.
In consequently, some authors were addressed to the test models protocols, which provide for the deterioration of models at 98°C (208°F) within 5 minutes to release GNK genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was declared that the quantity of the coronavir tests, which the United Arab Emirates have been conducted by the population, exceeds the indicators of any other country, and most of the population will be protested.
This occurred by the possibilities of testing, together with the receipt of the group 42 and BGI of the Mass Test Laboratorium (based on their laboratories on the detection of emergency cases in China).
This laboratory in 14 days is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory in the world of such a large scale that works on the parts of China.
Different test options addressed to different parts of the coronavir profile were multiplied in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Protection adopted a German version of testing compacts sent to a low income country without resources to repair their own compacts.
The German warrant was reported on 17 January 2020; the protocol, on the basis of the United States' sanitary epidemiological centres, was not available until 28 January, which led to the lack of tests in the United States. At the beginning of the efforts in China and the United States, there were problems with the confidence of tests, and these countries, as well as Australia, were not able to provide sufficient quantities of samples, recommended experts in the field of health.
In South Korea, as experts claim, the broad access to tests helped to reduce the distribution of the new coronavirus.
During a few years, the Government of South Korea worked on the ensuring of Property to test, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health has invited to improve the test programmes as the best way to reduce the distribution of the COVID-19 pandemia. As a result of the growth of the testing question resulting from the rapid distribution of virus, many of the United States private laboratories, in which hundreds of thousands of analysis models, have been threatened, and the stocks of materials for the extent of muscles and chemical reactions were rapidly exposed.
In March 2020, China reported the issues of the precision of its tests.
The American test compacts of the CDC had "insufficients" and therefore the Government removed bureaucratic bariers that mixed privately test tests. Spain received tests in the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of the use of these sets were unfair.
The company explained that the cause of failure of the results could be an insufficiency of the patterns or a wrong use of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would repeat the sets of unfair results and replace them by other sets of the Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test sets that Czech had received in China had wrong results. 1,2 million tests received by Slovakia were also recognised as irregular.
The Prime Minister Mattovic proposed to reject them in Dunai. Atesh Kara, the Ministry of Health of Turkey, stated that the test sets made in China had a "high level of errors" and the Ministry "do not use them." The United Kingdom bought 3,5 million tests in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 was declared that these orders were unusual.
The currency measures for persons whose analyses have been positively resulted in SARS-CoV-2 and the monitoring of people with whom such patients contacted.
The researchers who worked in the Italian town Wo, where the first man died from COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing of all populations that included approximately 3400 people, with an interval of approximately ten days.
About half of people with local results had no symptoms, and all patients with diseases were placed on corantine.
The introduction to the territory of the population has been closed, and this measure has completely stopped the distribution of the infection.
In the conditions of intensive monitoring of contacts, testing, and carantial measures of coronavir in Singapore in 2020, it has been much less stressed than in other developed countries, and there has not been an extent of the extent of the remote closing of restaurants and stores.
Many businesses were canceled there, and on March 28, Singapore began to advise the residents to stay home, but schools in which 23 March had been completed were opened on the basis of the designation.
Some other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also been handled by the Pandemy by intensive monitoring of contacts, injuries, testing and caranting measures, but they have had less aggressive characteristics.
The statistics showed that in countries where more tests were performed in comparison with the quantity of assets were highly lower, probably because more patients were able to be found in these countries with symptoms or without symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratory with the experience of work with COVID-19, send their first five local and the first ten negative results to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirming testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 – in Property, 2 in §, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the graph of the column ‘local results’ indicators depend on the test policy adopted in a specific country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in percentages compared to the country where all citizens are tested, independent of the presence of virus symptoms, in other conditions.
The blue hands, which are also as “higiene of hands”, are the process of cleaning hands to eliminate pollution, grass, microorganisms or other materials.
The regulation of swimming hands in certain " critical moments" prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera translated in a fax-oranic way.
Man may also be infected by respiratory diseases such as grip or normal prostitute, such as if he touches the eyes, nose or mouth (that is to the slides).
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be cut with the wheat: before and after defect, after the child's wheat or switching, before the child's feeding, before eating, and before and after the preparation of food or covering of grass meat, fish and domestic birds.
If water and smoke are not available, the hands can be cleaned with the waters. World Health is recommended to mix the hands:
Bye, in time and after preparation of food.
Before and after the procedures for a sick man.
After the change of the babies or the kid's mixture to the toilet.
After the smoking, the chicken, or the chickeny.
After touching animals, feed or residues of animal origin.
Medicinal hygiene is along with the hygiene action of medical procedures.
Empty hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will allow to prevent or minimize the distribution of diseases.
The basic medical goal is to clean hands from patogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases), as well as chemical arts that may occur or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing food or working in medical fields, but it is also important for all other people.
Blank hands for health: for example, it leads to the minimum distribution of grip, coronavir and other infections, prevents infection types of diaries, reduces the distribution of respiratory infections,
and decreases the level of childhood in households.
The 2013 study showed that a higher quality of hands can lead to a small level of children's growth at age of five.
In developing countries, the indicators of respiratory and diarrhoeatic diseases can be reduced by the use of simple habits such as muscle arms.
This elementary procedure is able to reduce the level of kvalitet from these diseases by nearly 50 per cent.
The regulatory reminders of the poultry of hands may reduce the number of cases of diaries around the third, which will be compared to the low level of income of pure water.
The decrease of the diarrhoea cases by 48 per cent may be with the hands of the mixture. The bleeding of hands with the mixture is the only most effective and irrelevant way of preventing diaries and intense respiratory diseases (OCS) when you have the corresponding habits in each house, schools and other public places worldwide.
Pneumonia, one of the main ORRI difficulties, is the main cause of children’s life in age to five years, which brings about 1,8 million children per year.
Of diarrhoea and pneumonia, some 3,5 million children per year are lost.
The Children of the United Nations reports that the mixing of hands before and after a toilet, which has been strongly used, can save more lives than any vaccine or medical involvement, and reduce the diarrhoea of almost two, and the decreasing of intense respiratory infections is fourth.
Blank hands are usually associated with other sanitary activities conducted in the framework of water supply, sanitary and hygiene programmes (WASH).
It also prevents the emergency of impetic diseases, which are transmitted in direct contact.
A small negative impact of the common weight of hands is that it can cause the skin to wash and, therefore, to her damage.
The 2012 Danish study showed that too often the arms can lead to sugar and skin shields, such as an ecstasy or an ecstasy, which is especially distributed among health careers.
It may also be considered too often to be one of the symptoms of obsession-compulsive disorder (OCR).
There are five such ‘ critical moments’ in the day when the swimming hands are important to decrease the risk of pharmaceutical illness: after the exposure (mocking, defectation), after the mixing of the child's wheat (smalls) before the feeding of the child, before the feeding and until/after the preparation of food or covering of green meat, fish or birds.
Other cases where hands should be mixed to prevent the transmission of diseases: before or after or after the injury of the poetry or of the wound, after the disorder, or smoking, after touching animal origins or animals, after touching the mushroom.
In many countries, the process of swimming hands has been shortly extended.
In 2015, the highest rates of hands made in 54 countries showed that 38.7 per cent of the middle of the mixture of the family was a generally accepted pro. The 2014 study showed that the highest indicator, 97 per cent, was fixed in Saudi Arabia; the United States is closer to the average, 77 per cent of them; the lowest indicator was fixed in China is 23 per cent. In the present, there are several methodological changes and the habits of smiling the hands in critical situations. In the developing of countries, the group of hands in schools at the appointed day is one of those methodology that helps to train children to the process.
The Programme for Medical Assistance, the Ministry of Education of Philippine, is an example of broad-scale activities for the strengthening of the health and increased educational levels of children.
This national programme is based on degelmintisation, which is two times per year, as well as daily swimming hands with milk and everyday cleaning of the fats.
The same programme is conducted successfully in Indonesia.
The elimination of microorganisms from each body is more efficient if weapons are added to the mixture process.
The basic performance of the milk and the mechanism is to eliminate bariers in order to solve and increase its level.
The water itself is not considered an effective means for cleaning the skin, since the fats and whites, which are organic pollution components, are wrongly dissolved in water.
The sufficient quantity of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
A strong wheel, due to multi-fold application, may also contain bacteria that can fall on it in the previous use.
A small number of studies dedicated to each cover of the bacteria with a threatened cow of a solid wheel refers to a small probability of such a occurrence, since the bacteria are disrupted with the pen.
The CZC still states that “the hand-dozator's mouth is a preferred option for hand-smoking”.
The antibacteriaal mile is actively announced in communities that forget their health.
Today there is no evidence of the fact that the use of recommended antiseptic or desinfective means is a choiceful effect on organisms that have sustainable antibiotics in their nature.
However, the antibacteriaal muscle contains distributed antibacteria agents such as triclosan, to which resident organs are sustainable.
Thus, even if the antibiotic stomachs are not eligible for an antibacterial milk, their efficiency may not be incompatible with the reclamed.
Furthermore, the surface-active arts and resources for the protection of skin, complex associations may contain oxygens (ususual, and milk) as a regulator of RN, as well as the antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other disorders (alias faith, vitamins, mentols, extractives). The Common analyse of the University of Public Health School of Oregon showed that in order to prevent diseases and elimination of bacteria with the skin, the simple diversity of milk is so effective as and the common antibacteriaal muscle containing triclosan.
The warm water is comfortable for the skin of temperature is still insufficient to kill bacteria.
Bacteria are much faster at the temperature of the body 37°C.
However, in order to remove natural animals holding threats and bacteria, heavy mixture water is more effective than cold.
Despite the extended opinion, scientific studies showed that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microb load on hands.
The defining means for hands (sanitazer) or an antiseptic for hands is a means for hygiene without water.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21th century, the population of the hygiene of hands on the basis of no water containing (a.k.a. as dezinfectation means for spare base, antiseptical means for dezinfection of hands or sanitary).
Most of these resources are made on the basis of an isop of a spiral or a tenol with additives, such as carbomer (acril acid polymer) in the form of gel or inflammators, such as glycerin in a hedge or penal form, which ensures the use of these funds and reduces the effects of the sharp skin.
Addition of the broadcast of waters increases the anti-microbial activity, which has a minimum of 60-95 per cent of spire effectively.
The disabilities on the basis of sterility kill bacteria, including bacteria with sustainable medication (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bottle and some virus (including HIV, herpes, RSV, renovirus, vaccine, grip and hepatitis) and grapes.
The definitory means containing 70% of the spirit kills 99.97% of the bacteria (reduction logistics of 3.5 analogue reduction by 35 decibel) in hands in 30 seconds after the use and 99.99% of the bacteria (reduction logic 4-5) in hands in a minute after the application. The dezinfiction tools for hands are the most effective against the bacteria and are less effective against some viruses.
The deficiencies on a set basis are practically ineffective against the virus of the type Norwalk (or Norwalk) of the most frequent cause of infection gastrointestinal infection. It is necessary to also use a sufficient quantity of antiseptics or spirit contents to consider and ask the skin from both sides.
The face and steady surface of both ladons, as well as the space between the fingers throughout the length of about 30 seconds until the wheat, the pen or the gel is completely asked.
The fingerprints on both hands should also be closely cut off. The United States control and profile of disease recommends to choose for the use of hands, not for disabilities, especially if the hands are extremely threatened.
The growth of the population of such disabilities is the simplicity of their use and the rapid use of micro-organisms, but they should not be replaced for full-valuing arms if it is possible to use water and milk.
The common use of dezinfiction instruments for the hands on a spiral basis may result in sugar of the skin if they do not contain the mixing and/or the skin inflammators.
Effects of the skin can be reduced or removed by adding the glycerine and/or other mixing materials.
In clinical trials, the dezinfictions of the materials for hands on the basis of mixing components have caused significantly less disorder and suicide of skin than milk or antimicrobial potential.
Alergic contact debt, contact box syndrome or hypersensitiveness to the dispute or additives presented in dezinfiction means are practically not occurred.
The lavere probability of encouraging contact deficiency has become a factor in the choice of disabilities in comparison with milk and water.
Despite their efficiency, the means that do not contain water are not cleaning their hands from organic arts, but simply disabilize them.
It is therefore not so effective to prevent many pathogic microorganisms, such as normal milk and water, as patogenic microorganisms still remain on their hands when using such means.
The efficiency of the dezinfiction instrument for hands that have no spirit is significantly depending on components and sums, and has been significantly lower than the spiral or the spiral contents.
Recently, the medicinal products used by benzalconia chloride, the equipment of steam and cumulative antimicrobial activity, as shown, lose efficiency after multi-fold use, probably because of the progressive effects of each side effect.
Many people in the community with low income cannot allow themselves to replace it with oil or gly.
Oil or glyne can be more effective than only water, but they will always be less efficient than milk.
One of the problems with this method is that if the glace or oil are threatened by micro-organisms, it may, in contrast, increase the expansion of the disease.
Like milk, the salt is a dezinficing means, since in the context of water, it forms a cruel solution.
If the wheel is not available, the WHO alternate recommends and uses a wheel or a song.
In order to prevent the infection of the United States Infection Centre, it is recommended to apply the hand-building technology including the following:
Put your hands under warm or cold steel water.
It is recommended that the water standing can be threatened, and this water temperature does not have any meaning.
Help your hands by spreading them with a large quantity of milk, including the thick side of the ladons, as well as the areas between the fingers and under the feet.
Weather removes microbs from the skin, and studies suggest that when we use the weapons (not only one water) humans are able to swim down their hands more intensely.
Three hands for at least 20 seconds.
The trend helps to remove microbs from the skin, and as long as you have the hands, more microbs are removed.
Excellently stuck hands under the steel water.
Manage in the steel of water can cause a repeated deterioration.
Put your hands out of the pure bottle, or let them smile themselves.
The most often people remain without attention such areas such as a big hair, an inflammation, the area between fingers and footnotes.
Educational foots and throat lakes for node may contain microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use an inflammation loton to prevent the skin of hands that may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If it is not available, there are various inappropriate ways to weigh the hand: water evaporation from the higher canister or bottle tissue with processed openings and/or use of oil if it is necessary, for example, in developing countries. In places with water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-free decisions such as crane with food pedals and other insufficient warrants.
It is a simple co-operation that consists of the embossed throat, and a knife throat that should be pressed to swim in the hands of water; it should also be used as a cup of oil.
The effective sugar of hands is an inevitable part of the hygiene process, but some of the most effective forms of sugar in public trains are conducted.
The growing volume of studies shows that the papers are very hygiene than the electrical sugars for hands established in many toilets.
In 2008, the Westminster University in London was conducted an investigation that was sponsored by the Spansor’s symposium on the production of paper salpets and lottery; this study was a comparison of the hygiene level of paper lottery, sugar for hands with heavy air and more modern air flows for hands.
It was established that the total number of bacteria on the middle fingerprints increased by 194 per cent and 254 per cent in the ladders.
It was also found that the total quantity of bacteria on the fingerprints increased by 42 per cent and 15 per cent on the ladders.
The total quantity of bacteria on fingerprints in the middle is reduced to 76 per cent and at the ladone is up to 77 per cent, and the scientists have also been tested to determine the possibility of cross-border infections of several tourists and toilet in each type of sugar.
Stroo-air sush, which releases air with 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 km/h), is able to exhaust micro-organisms from hand and from its own block and is able to swallow other toilet and sandal users in the radio to 2 meters.
The exhibition of the sugar for hands with warm air extends micro-organisms in the radius to 0.25 metres from the sugar.
In 2005, TÜV Product and Environment studied various methods of sugar.
The changes in the number of bacteria are monitored depending on the sugar method:
There are many different manufacturers of sugars for hands, and the hands are compared to the sugar of paper bottles.
Cleaning hands with the use of dezinfiction salpets may be an alternative solution during traveling when weapons and water are missing.
The determining device for hands should contain at least 60 per cent of spiral.
The medical way to switch hands a long time after the Hungarian doctor Ignac Zemelways discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in the profile of stationary diseases.
There are electronic devices that remind hospitals of the need to smile hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the infection level.
At least 15 seconds, the medical mixture of hands is used by a large quantity of milk, water or gel for each part of the hand.
The hands should be closely lost each other by striving their fingers.
If there is a wheel under the feet, it can be used to remove it.
Since microbs can remain in water on their hands, it is important that they are well spread and cut off the snake of the pure swimming.
After a thick hand, closing the crane, and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, the paper lottery should be used.
This allows you to escape the rearrangement of the hands from these tops.
The aim of switching hands in medical institutions is to remove pathogen microorganisms (microbs) and to prevent their distribution.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the number of hands remains inappropriate in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and sisters regularly forget to smile their hands before touching patients and thus spread micro-organisms.
Following one study, the right mixture of hands and other elementary procedures may reduce the level of blood-coated infections used by category to 66 per cent. The World Health Protection has opened a footer with the image of a standard mixture procedure and the hands to be applied in the health sector.
The WHO project is also available on its website and open for public discussions.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby in cohesion.
If the normal requirements are required, commercial devices can be used to measure and check the hygiene.
World Health Protection means "five minutes" when it is necessary:
after contact with blood or biological disorders,
before use of antiseptics and
After the patient's outcome procedure. Adding antiseptical chemicals to milk in hands (“medical ” or “antimicrobial“ mile”) helps to produce bacteria.
Such antibacteria may be properties before the operation of chirurgical operations or in the middle of high content of antibiotic organs. To purify the hands before the operation, it is required to include and exclude, without having hands; to also use a few chlorides or waters to put hands on, stearing the hands of a swimming hands after the thought, a steril sack for the trend and another sterile tool for cleaning under the feet.
All improvements must be removed.
This procedure requires a mixture of hands and before the lock in general for 2 to 6 minutes.
There's no need to lose hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During the laying, the water with the front should not fall back on the hands.
After the finishing of the bullet, the hands are cut off with a sterile cup and put a chirurgical chalat.
In order to reduce the distribution of microbs, it is better to cut hands or to use an antiseptic for hands before and after the treatment of a diseased person.
For combating stafilococtic infections in hospitals, it was established that the greatest benefit from the first 20 per cent of the fat was brought and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of hands was increased by more than 35 per cent.
In comparison with the mixture of antibacteriaal mixture, the arms of the normal mixture lead to more than three-second increases in the frequency of bacteria infections translated through food, comparison of the contrast with the spiral solution and the mixture of the hands of antibacteriaal mixture, in average of 30 seconds on each procedure, showed that the dilution of the arms of spirthocontaining solution had reduced the bacteria pollution by 26% compared to antibacterian muscle.
However, I am still more effective than spiral solutions for hands, in order to reduce the number of grip A H1N1 and ­ Clostridium diff·le viruss. The development of hygiene in the medical institutions may include the training of the staff with hands, the accessibility of spiral solutions for hands, as well as the written and mouth reminders of the staff's needs.
An additional study of the most effective types of measures in various medical institutions is required.
In developing countries, the mixture of myl is recognised as an economic and important means to improve health and even food.
However, the lack of steady water supply, swimming or resources in houses, schools, and slaves in the morning, is the habit of regularly wearing their hands.
For example, in most areas, no longer in each private or public toilet has a handbound, although the ways are to organize hands in such places.
However, lack of hygiene can also be caused by increasing habits, not by the lack of mylk or water.
The promotion and stimulation of the arms with the muscle can affect political decisions, increase the level of awareness of the pool of the hands and bring long-term changes to the behaviour of the population.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and monitoring of the results should be carried out.
In the system analysis of 70 studies, there is found that in order to improve the situation with higiene hands in countries with a medium-epidemic supervision at Community level, a more effective supervision of public market campaigns is less effective. One of the examples of propaganda in the schools in the United Nations Children's Footnote of the United Nations is the approach to the Three Star Approach: it promotes § in the schools of simple economic measures stimulating the hands of students with the use of muscles, as well as the fulfilment of other gigienic requirements.
In order to comply with minimum standards, schools can increase their levels from one to three stars.
The establishment of hands is one of the measures made under the instruction campaigns on hygiene with a view to reducing the disease and disease levels.
The World Day of Arms (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an inequation campaign aimed at changing the behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavir pandemia, the United Nations Children's Fund continues to use Âdozi, symbolized by hands.
In the course of some studies, the general efficiency in developing countries was considered in comparison with the DALYs indicator (reserved years of life without invalidity).
However, in one of the studies, it is expected that the stimulation of the swimming hands with the milk is a significantly more economic solution compared to other health measures.
The importance of man's hands - especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded guests in hospitals - was first recognized by two hygiene innovators in the middle of the 19th century: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Sammelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis) and Florence Naitingale (Florence Nightingale), the English nurse and “the foundation of the current income of diseases”.
At that time, most people have still believed that infections were caused by anxieties called myasms.
In the 1980 ’ s, in relation to the insufficiency of diseases, through food trading and infections with medical assistance, the United States control and profile of diseases became more active to promote hygiene arms as an important step to prevent the distribution of infection.
As a result of the increasing grippe in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemia in 2020, people in many countries became better understanding how important it was to put hands on the muscle to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, nearly with public tourists, as well as in office trains and airports, the posts with the "governmental teams of hands".
The phrase ‘taking hands’ means the manifestation of its unnecessaryness to take responsibility for anything or to be part of anything.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate “smiled his hands ” in making decisions about Jesus Christ’s disappointment; then, this phrase was more useful in some English communities.
In the "Mackbeet", Shexpere's lady's starting inappropriately taking hands in trying to purify from the inappropriate consciousness in relation to the crimes that she has committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also established that people who remembered or observed any non-ethical acts are often able to strike hands in comparison with others, and their hands are more important for them.
More likely, people who have the opportunity to swallow their hands after seeing will be involved in any other "pursuing" compensatory activities, such as voluntary activities.
In religious religions, it is also a hygiene goal and a symbol of significance. The symbolic weeping of water but without weapons is a part of the ritual that is provided in many religions, including bahaism, induism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in the Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
Industry, Judaism and Islam have been prescribed by the commitment to the toilet after visiting.
Induism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered a mixture of hands before and after each feed is accepted.
Control of productive factors relating to COVID-19
The control of productive factors relating to COVID-19 underlines the application of methods for the safety of work and health in order to control the risk and combat the coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate control of risks on the slave depends on the places and workers of the task, based on the assessment of risks, serious situations with epidemic in the community and risk factors for individuals who may be vulnerable with COVID-19.
The United States Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that jobs with less risk levels have minimum contacts with publicity and colleagues, and in such cases, basic measures are required in combating infection, including arms, stimulation of residues in the home in the case of disease, the monitoring of the repair label, and the conduct of daily disorders and the disinfection of the environment.
Medium risk obligations require partial or close contacts with people who do not have a COVID-19 diagnose or suspicious diagnosis, but there is a possibility of injury in relation to the current distribution of diseases in society or in the way of poess.
Such category can be done by people who contact the public, such as schools, slaves in the field of high population and in some major different stores.
The risk control measures for such groups, other than the basic infection measures, include the use of high-effective air filters, the use of protective screens and personal protection tools for contact with the person infected with COVID-19.
The OSHA believes that the medical institutions and maritimes contacted with a person with a diagnosis or a suspicion of COVID-19 are related to a high risk category; therefore, the risk is increased to a very high level when taking such procedures, leading to the education of aerosol, or the collection/proof of a person with diagnosis or suspiciousness of COVID-19.
The risk control measures appropriate for such assets include the use of engineering and technical security means such as ventilations with negative pressure, as well as personal protection funds suitable for the relevant task.
The effort of COVID-19 may lead to various types of effect on the slave.
Workers may not be on a slave in relation to their own illness, the need for concern for other persons or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial models may be changed as regards the types of goods in question, as well as the ways for such goods (e.g., purchasing the purchases in a short period of delivery or service, unless out of the car).
Finally, the provision of goods from the geographical regions covered by COVID-19 can be used in order to organise protection plans for preparation for epidemic and responsibilities.
The plans concern the issues of risks that have different slave sites and tasks, including infection sources, risk factors, homes and communities, as well as risk factors of individuals, such as age or chronic disease.
The plans also indicate the control means to solve such risk problems, as well as the plans of extreme activities for situations that can result in the epidemic.
Plans for preparation for epidemic and responsible measures may be subject to national or state level recommendations.
• Responsible measures in relation to epidemic: reduction of virus distribution between staff, protection of people under higher risk of health risks, maintenance of business operations and minimising negative impacts for other organizations in their staff.
Responsible measures affect the seriousness of the diseases in the community where business is located.
The erection of risk controls is a broad structure used for safety and work hygiene to group such funds depending on efficiency.
If the risk of the COVID-19 disease is not possible, the most effective engineering engineering means of safety, then the administrative measures and, finally, the personal protection means.
Engineering and safety means under the Property isolation of risks which have been used by the Property and are not confident of the behavior, which may be the most beneficial economic solutions.
Administrative measures are required to amend slave policies or procedures.
Personal protection (PPE) means are considered less effective in comparison with engineering or administrative measures, but can help to eliminate certain risks.
All types of personal protection means should be chosen depending on the threat of a person, adjusting the size (e.g. the respirators) and continuously and appropriately using, the rule is to be checked, supported and replaced as necessary, as appropriate, and to be cleared, cleaned and stored or disabled in the avoidance of infections.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that posts with minimum risk have a minimum contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures for combating epidemics recommended for all slaves include frequency and careful arms, recommendations for the disease of those who remain home, the monitoring of the respiratory label, including the closing of the mouth in the hands and the closing of the hands, the ensuring of silvests and containers for the murder, the preparation for remote or changing, where necessary, the recommendation for the use of other instruments and equipment, as well as the continuation of the daily preparation and the disinfection of the environment.
The quick discovery and isolation of persons who may be infected potentially is a critical step to protect the customers, customers, visitors and others on the slave.
The United States disease and their profile (CDC) recommends that the symptoms of intense respiratory disease remain home before the break of the fat, the lack of a higher body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without use of medicines or other medicines that eliminate symptoms, as well as intends to ensure the deficiency of hospitality policies, to allow the home to stay behind a family member and to ensure that such policies are notified.
According to OSHA, average risk-level posts require partial and close contacts at the distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons who have no data or doubts on the infection of COVID-19, but there is the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 injury in relation to the expansion of disease in the community in the area where business is, or in the case of recent divisions of the COVID-19.
These categories are related to engineering and higher risks for such groups and groups, such as schools, workers in the environment with high level of population and some major different stakeholders. The engineering and technical means of security for such groups and groups with higher risk are related to the establishment of high-effective air filters, the enhancement of ventilation, the establishment of physical bariers, such as transparent plastic protection screens, and the mobility of mobility for customer service without output. The administrative measures for such groups and groups of higher risks include the promotion of assets, the promotion of workers, the financing and the financing of workers, the replacement of special works on the community with the support of customer services, with the support of customer services, the financing of the financing of non-financing and the financing of the financing of the financing of the financing areas, the financing, the financing of the financing, and the financing of the financing of the employment, and the financing of the financing of the financing of the , and the financing of the financing of the employment, the employment, and the financing of the financing of the , the employment and the financing of the financing of the employment, and the , resources of the , resources, resources of the , resources, resources of the financing of the , and the financing of the financing of the , and the employment employment , and the employment employment employment , and the , and the employment of the employment of the employment of the employment of the , and the employment of the employment of the employment of the , and the employment of the ture of the employment , , and the employment of the employment of the employment of the employment of the , and the , and the , and the , the employment of the employment of the employment of the employment of the employment of the employment of the employment of the employment ture of the employment of the ture of the employment employment employment employment archi ; financial archi , , , , , , , , , and the , and the , and the archi ; ; employment ; , employment ; , the , the employment employment financing of the financing of the ; , and the , , , , the ture of the ture of the ture of the ture of the ture of the ture of the ture of the ture of the employment employment , and the , and the ture of the employment employment struct struct struct ; ; ; ; ; ; ture of the ; ture of the ; ; ; ture ; , , , , , , , , the , , , , , , , , ; , ture of the , , , employment , employment employment employment , employment , , , , , , , , , , , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;
In rare cases, repairs may need to be taken from such a group of risks.
If a person has been sick in the aircraft, there are measures such as isolation of a sick person from other people to race 6 feet, designation of a member of an equipment for a diseased person, supply of a sick mask or to such a person with a request to cover the nose and the mouth of the slaughter or the chickeny.
Increased members of the equipment must carry once medical sticks when approaching a sick traveller or in confronting physically injury or potentially infected surfaces and may be added to personal protection means if you have a disease, a regulation or a disorder difficulty.
In cases of commercial courtship, including cross-border and other passenger ships, the safety measures are to be delayed in the case of illness, self-isolation and immediate information of the medical centre on the ship in the cases of the ship, including cross-border and other ships.
In the ideal, the medical survey should be held in the isolated couthe of such a person. In the case of schools and bodies for children, the CDC recommends to carry out a short-term closure for closing or disinfection if a infected person is in school opinion, independent of the distribution of the disease in the community.
In the light of a minimum or average level of distribution of infections in the community, it may be possible to introduce the distance, such as the cancellation of outcomes for different meetings, meetings and other mass activities such as the occupation of physicil or body drinks, the receipt of food in cafeteria, the increased distance between parties, the time of arrival and outcome, the disabled visits, the use of a significant location of health institutions for children with grip symptoms.
In significant levels of distribution in the community, other than the distant distance, the measures for long non-school can be considered. For legal protection bodies who exercise daily responsibilities, the direct health risk is considered to be low as a CDC.
It is recommended that the members of the legal protection bodies to contact the underlying diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 follow the same instructions prescribed by the officers of quick assistance, including the use of appropriate personal protection means.
When heavy contact occurs in the detention, the employees must clean and determine their formed embarrassments and emissions before reuse by means of bicycle cleaning aircrafts or by purchasing, keep standard operational procedures for preventing the distribution of disease and the use of personal protection means, as well as for the use and the strengthening of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and maritime institutions are highly or very highly risked.
Heavy risk officers are related to medical assistance, support, laboratory and medical transport staff that contact patients with sub-diagnosis or predicted COVID-19.
They have a high risk of infringement in their procedures, which lead to the education of aerosol, or at the collection of tests with sub-diagnosis or the predicted COVID-19.
Aerosol educational procedures are related to sanctions, procedures calling for aids, bronchoscope, some stomatological procedures and investigations or testing invasive methods.
In the case of high-risk martyrs, people who are underlying or suspecting COVID-19 in the moment of their death; if such conditions are covered, they go to a very high risk category. Additional engineering safety tools for such groups include the use of isolated places for patients with underlying disease or suspiciousness of COVID-19, including in the course of procedures that lead to the education of aerosol.
In some healthcare and marketing institutions, the use of a special ventilation with negative pressure may be effective.
The tests should be subject to the precautionary measures provided for for the level of biosecurity 3.
The World Health Protection (WHO) recommends to distribute patients in a limited area of expectation depending on the suspicion of the COVID-19 arrest. In addition to other personal protection means, OSHA recommends and uses the respirators that are involved in a distance of 6 feet with patients with underlying disease or suspicious of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the procedures in which are conducted by the aerosol education.
In the United States, NIOSH respirators for the N95 filter or higher class need to be used in the framework of the comprehensive repair protection programme, in which the requirements for individual equipment and medical reviews are set out.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for Property. The WHO does not recommend or use speed, since COVID-19 is a disease that is transmitted respiratoryly, not through physical disorders.
The WHO recommends and only uses chirurgical masks for the staff that carries the patient's receipt point.
Persons who collect models from respiratory ways in patients with COVID-19 or carriers of this disease without aeronautical training procedures, the WHO recommends to carry out a chirurgical mask, protective eyes or a protective screen for Property, calat and purchase.
In the course of procedures conducted by the aerosol education, the mask chirurg should be carried out by N95 or FFP2.
Taking into account the inadequateness of individual protection means throughout the world, the WHO recommends to minimize the need for such means of protection on the basis of the use of a distant medication, physical barriers, such transparency, access to the patient infected with COVID-19, only those who show direct approach, apply only the personal protection funds that are responsible for a specific task, the continuous use of one and the same repository, not taking into account several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of personal protection and recommendations.

TEMA: [Covid-19] Availability of loading and preparation for the future
Date/Time EXPIRY: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
RESULTATION: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we live in extreme circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemy is a manifestation that brings light on people of all the world and responsibility towards each other.
We have no previous problems, but we have the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to be compassionate, cooperation and development of the communities worldwide, which is based on such organization.
We have observed the companions and forgetful among all our colleagues, which were reflected in electronic records, sounds and teases, is a wonderful subject to the fact that, for lucky people work with us.
I'm with great appreciation and bitterness talking about you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the high assessment of our work.
I believe that it is important for peace to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how important it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And it may be thanks to you, either by providing the ability of sites, paying our colleagues or protecting community security.
The world needs information presented in Wikipedia, and this is still more important than ever before.
At that time to gain significant results for the world, it is not just what we do, but and how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in our joint work, starting a week.
Correction of our work and graphics
As Robin said earlier, the "c-team" team gathered last night to discuss our approach and graphics in the present days and months.
In the community, we considered our ideas at the most effective steps in the present situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The long-term majority of us wanted to discover the pressure and support the long-term mission.
If you want to stop, let's go.
For all staff, suppliers and foreigners:
We expect to work approximately 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the following arrangements come.
We don't announce the expiry days: if you can work normally for more hours, this will be permitted for our mission's purposes.
However, the world is now unpredicted; whatever you need, whether you forget family, get food or get to the doctor, your goods is our priority number one.
We don't follow your worktime.
If you were sick, you shouldn't work.
It's understandable and unrespectable, but we're talking about it.
It is not necessary to form a hospital or a total: just inform your owner and help the team to review the calendar and work graph to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a COVID-19 diagnose, please report Brian from T&C Ops to provide T&C support and care for your situation).
The payment of time rates will be carried out in full amount.
We have already announced and confirmed our commitment to comply with the commitment to our subordinators and ­time payments.
Each person will receive a payment of normal time rates in normal circumstances.
This is, in particular, undergoing the periods of disease when you can't work.
If you're going to work, we'll support you.
Many people use the way to make their efforts in the world around us.
What we do can bring wonderful results, especially in such times.
And again, and about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with our owner so that we may know what to expect, and we would be able to correct our actions accordingly.
The types of work are considered fair.
Such activities should always be supported.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (other) commands are critically important for further support.
We initiate the process for all subdivisions in order to evaluate the current objectives and to provide a focus on support that is extremely important for our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we simply focus on the most important projects.
The injury today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We are not planning to work "double more to overcome the lost" after the end of the Pandemia.
You will not need to work at a time to comply with the non-real terms for the current time.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work on the establishment of new objectives and periods as possible.
What happens to APP (year plans)?
To focus on the new reality and expectations of the daily slave time, we are able to correct the time of the implementation of our Year Plan for 2020-2012.
We are able to propose a long time for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing them to give critically important priorities, self-aid and access to neighbors, and to ensure a reduced graph for the next few weeks.
Such duration allows significantly to reduce the current planning and pressure burden throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Council on the week, and we will inform the representatives and teams of the current information on the steps, as well as after the receipt of the relevant undertaking.
Thanks to the APP team for the role in this.
With Office, risks and clothing
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected by the COVID-19 virus.
Nevertheless, in addition to the precautionary measures, we adopted a team for anti-virus disinfectation of all surfaces in the Office in San Francisco.
They repeat the antiviral solutions of the Medical Class to determine all surfaces, as well as the acceptable and lift hols through which access to our stage.
It is said that the own rules for care are applied with the use of products that ensure the safety of their holders.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we will decide to return.
Our office in Columbia (DC) is located in the WeWork network, which shared with us and all the staff in the DC, its rules of COVID-19.
Last week, our Office in Columbia was completely moved to remote inside the directions in San Francisco.
Like some of our colleagues from New York, we also discussed the issue of the townary board in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be released.
Our colleagues first work remotely.
Our old colleagues who work remotely know the opportunity to correct the situation and wish to give you some advice:
It is recommended that the length of the meetings below one or two hours.
If you need more longer sessions, consider the opportunity to divide them to the course of several days.
The aim of the meeting, the agenda and previously set out the materials to be known.
Default use video connections, to facilitate interactions and connections such as Google Docs and Zoom.
In order to please, specify a coordinator, a person who will follow the issues in the chat and control the numbers of shockers, as well as the responsible for making notes (or the joint for acquiring).
If necessary, select the technical support for e-mail.
Take care of your wellness Reimbursement programme's benefits in receipt of deal.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to the colleagues about the designed §.
The HR Operations command examines the engineering management available in the form of webers in order to facilitate the efficiency of the whole organization.
Last week, we asked all the recipients of the community to reject the mass activities of Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until the WHO announced the end of the Pandemy.
We understand and report that our requests for such a cancellation and other applications may not be able to carry out grant activities, and no one will be treated for the delays or change of such objectives.
In the next week, we will take the following activities with additional indications on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The global creation in the global community is not only a threat to interruption of work, but also a few feelings of facilitation in relation to interconscience and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia, and not only.
The CRT works on the Meta-Wiki page, which provides the space for the community that allows monitoring the effects and community.
We remain on issues related to COVID-19
We will send a invitation to your calendar to a special meeting of the staff, which will be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we hope that the opportunity is to share the current inquiry, to answer your questions and to take time together and to join each other.
We are together in such a situation, and we are ready to help all that we can.
You can still receive information from such electronic rescription and other important information on COVID-19 from the Wiki Office.
The CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one.
We also work on supporting the rule of communication with the staff in countries on which the present situation has been significantly affected.
In the case of issues on drivings, businesses, the key slave of the flood, information problems or, if necessary, the CRT's help.
We are ready to provide support and to ensure the relationship as necessary.
In the case of the issues of confidence, you will select email to Brian Judan (Bryan Judan), director HR International Global Operations.
No such changes should be considered as a refusal of our work and our commitments.
Instead, this is a recognition of the possible need for the cardinally new adjustment of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are to support one another and to ensure that it is possible to continue, to provide the necessary support for our movement and the whole world with the necessary service.
Our planning work is to take place until the time.
Today, it has been time to support each other and to create an important space for the future weeks and maybe months.
To happen this, we need help from each of you; and we need you to forget yourself and your families, and to work with the maximum delivery as soon as this is necessary.
Now, please, help your hands and don't get your hands!

Angyotensin-converting farm 2 (ACE2) is a farm attached to the external surface (cell membranes) cells in the areas, arteries, hearts, pockets and boxes.
ACE2 resists the activity of the relevant angiotension-converting farmer (ACE), reduces the contents of an angiotensin-II and increases − (1-7), making its multi-promising solutions for the treatment of heart-conscious diseases. Property2 also serves a point of access to cells for some coronavirus.
The human farm version of the farm is often mentioned as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting pharmaceutical 2 is a cyclocontaining metal pharmaceutical factor that is situated on the surface of endoteal cells and other cells.
White ACE2 contains N-end peptidae domain M2 and S-end transport domain of renal aminocyl collectrine.
ACE2 is a single mixed white of type I, its farmed active domain falls on the surface of cells and other teeth.
ACE2 incellent domain is removed from the transmembered domain by another farm, such as seeddase, and the dissolved white is released in the blood rock and finally resulted with the sword.
ACE2 is present in most bodies: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of the majority of alveo cells of type II, tone wallets, artificial and vulneral endoteal cells and glass muscles of most organ artery.
ACE2 and RNK biosinthesis is also found in the core of the brain, the striat, the hypothalamus and the brain.
The ACE2 basic function is to be expressed as an ACE contradiction.
ACE spreads an angiotensine I hormone in constitutional angiotension II.
ACE2, in its course, removes the carbo-conceptive aminocycle phenylanain from an angiotenzin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vazodilatator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also increase a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apeline, neurotenzine, dinorphine A and graline.
ACE2 also regulates the embarrassment of the SLC6A19 neutro-aminocyl transporter and is present in Hartnupa’s disease.
As a transmembered white, ACE2 serves the main point of access to cells for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus calling SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus called COVID-19).
In fact, S1 was SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with a farming domain ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytose and translocation, as well as the farm in endosome.
This income process also requires an approximation of the serial protease of the TMPRSS2, which is currently considered as a potential therapy, which led to some idea that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can help to combat infections.
However, many community professionals and regulatory bodies recommend to continue the standard APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to the system of review and meta-analysis held on 11 July 2012, “the APF inhibitors were significantly reduced by 34 per cent of the risk of penalty compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia was also decreased in patients, receiving APF inhibitors, which were higher risked by illness of pneumonia, especially patients with insultative and heart failure.
The exercise of APF inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in penis, although the results were less reliable than in patients with a general risk of pneumonia.’
Recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is an innovative therapy in heat disorders and apparently improves the genetic hemodynamic and the saturation of oxygen with a syndrome of a respiratory insufficiency caused by lipopolisharides.
RhACE2 is about 10 hours and the beginning of the action is 30 minutes, along with the duration of the exercise at 24 hours.
The data test that rhACE2 may be a multi-promising means for people with classic inhibitors of the renin-angiotension system (RAS-inhibitors) or in illnesses in which an angiotension II has increased. In the clinical trials, rhACE2 has been evaluated in the treatment of a heavy respiratory distress-syndrome.
The Annexes to COVID-19 constitute programming applications for mobile phones intended for help in the epidemiological investigation under the 2019-20 coronavir pandemia, namely in the discovery of persons ("contakts") that could be contacted with the infected person.
In some regions, Annexes officially supported by authorities were broadcast or proposed.
There were several options for the monitoring of contacts.
This has caused a discussion on the issues of confidence, especially on the systems that are to follow the geographical location of the users of applications.
In this context, more slighter options include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user's nearby phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that their efforts to integrate worked in support of such applications on the basis of Bluetooth directly in their operational systems Android and iOS.
In China, the Government with Alipay has extended an application that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it is used an application called TraceTogether.
The annex was broadcast by IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted under the Government. The North Seedone has launched the "StopKorona" Annex to Bluetooth, which helps to follow contacts with potentially infected people and to ensure an operational relationship with healthcare bodies.
The Annex was joined by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By 14 April 2020, the application expected registration in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government claimed that the application to follow contacts is at the final stage and will be available for several weeks. Analogical applications are planned to launch in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand consider the possibility of use of applications based on TraceTogether and BlueTrace Protocol. Russia is also using the geozone function, which aims to monitor patients with COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, the Cambridge University, refers to a number of potential practical problems that may occur on the basis of applications, including false works and potential inefficiency in the use of only a small part of the population.
Taking into account the concern of the extent of the expansion of the ‘coronavirus’ applications or of the ‘coronavirus’ applications, Apple held a series of organisations that may comply with their applications, which have been applied with the coronavirus, in App Store, including only ‘of ’ or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also introduced similar performances.
Participants of the campaign on confidentiality have expressed the sustainability of the effects of the mass monitoring of the population through the applications of the coronavirus; in particular, the question was whether the infrastructure of monitoring would be demounted for combating the coronavirus pandemies when the threat was lost.
Organization of the International Amnist and more than 100 other organizations of the op.
Organizations announced eight of the public projects:
monitoring must be "legal, proportional and proportional";
The enlargement of monitoring and monitoring should be subject to responsibilities for the time of action;
The use of data should be made for the purposes of combating the distribution of COVID-19;
Data safety and anonymity should be protected and must be provided for the evidence of such protection;
Digital monitoring should exclude cases of discrimination and marginalisation;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the level of law;
It must be guaranteed to protect crimes, as well as the right of civils to respond to misuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporters Withoutout Borders (Reporter without limits) (RSF) should also be provided for as a significant participation in all "compliant interested parties", including experts in the field of public health and representatives of marginalised groups.
Google and Apple have a joint plan to solve the problem of continuous monitoring, which is involved in eliminating the mechanism of monitoring from the operational systems of their devices as soon as it is necessary.
In some countries, in place of applications, the network monitoring of the location is used, excluding the need for loading the application and the possibility of avoiding follow-up.
In Israel, the network follower was approved.
Network decisions that have access to the source data on the location also have great potential for confidentiality problems.
However, not all central server systems should have access to personal data on the location; a number of systems with confidentiality used by the centre of the servers only to connect (see section below).
In South Korea, there was a system that was not used as a basis for contacts.
Instead of using the special application, the system collected information on follow-up from various sources, including the monitoring of mobile devices and transactions with cards, and then approved them to make notifications in the form of text messages sent to potentially infected.
The Government had not only provided this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons, but also made information about the locality of public access, which has become aware of the changes in the law of the protection of information which were in the light of the MERS in this country.
Access to such information can be received through a number of applications and websites, including Germany, which provides the opportunity to use both centralised systems and confidentiality systems.
The details have not been discovered on 6 April 2020.
The monitoring of contacts with confidentiality is a consistent concept, a significant volume of studies of the Library of 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups worked on decisions that provide confidence, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user's access to other mobile phones.
However, the PP-PT is a product of coordination efforts, including centralised and de-aliased approaches, and is not one protocol, where the protocols include a detailed trace with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, mechanisms for mobile contacts (PACT) and other.
These protocols are responsible for that identifying different data would never leave the device, but all the comparisons of it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab works with the SafePaths, the form to ensure confidentiality in collecting and use of data on the location or transfer of ways to follow the COVID-19 distribution.
The work of this formula for the studies carried out in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: holding Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” ("Programmes-Hulagans: how to maintain confidentiality during the epidemic"), which was held in March 2020. Another similar project is SafeTrace, the Enigma MPC, a company that develops the confidentiality technology, which was also initially MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable equipment technology that allows users to exchange confidential data on the location and health status with other users and officers without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the groups dividing the same approach and using similar protocols was a global TCN coalition, which aimed at reducing the fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of applications for monitoring and notification, which is the key factor of their broad distribution.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, firms who control the phone forms Android and iOS, announced the initiative for the monitoring of contacts which, as they claimed, provide confidentiality and which is based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography technology.
They also repeat the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system must be expanded in three steps:
Enhancement of instruments that allow governments to establish an application to follow the prevision of the infected coronavirus but to maintain confidentiality of data
By integrating this functional directly in iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve problems with continuous monitoring, introducing a system by updating the operational system, and then removed it in the same way after a threat occurred.
The replacement of the medicinal product (as well as reprofilation, recycling, change of tasks or therapy) is the re-profilation of a medicinal product in order to treat disease or health status that is different from the disease, particularly provided for in the case of dilution.
It is one of the directions of scientist studies that are currently used to develop safe and effective treatment methods of COVID-19.
Other studies include the COVID-19 vaccine and the reconvolution of the plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 whites, subject to the exercise of medicines, each of which has several liangs of debt.
Analysis of these convictors is a suitable basis for enhancing effective antiviral anti-viral products against white COVID-19.
The most important white mixtures for SARS-CoV-2 — a papain-like protease, a RNC-dependent polymerase, a helicopathe, a white S and AF-ribofosphatase.
Hussein AA and co-operators in their document studied several candidates, which were then optimized, and analysis of their equality on the structure with most approved medicinal products in order to enhance high-effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2, recommended for clinical studies.
Chlorohyne is an opposite medicine that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmunal diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chlorochine and hydrochlorohyne with him would enter into the number of four medicines investigated in the ‘Solidarity’ test.
The Governing Board of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that chlorokin and hydrochlorokine exposure would be started on 24 March. 28 March the FDA allowed the use of hydrochlorokin sulphate and chlorophosphate in the EU with extreme application permit.
The treatment scheme was not approved in the process of clinical FDA trials and was permitted in EUA only as an experimental treatment for non-resolving assistance in patients hospitalized, but cannot be treated on clinical experience schemes.
The CDC stated that “the order of use, dose or duration of hydrochlorokine is not yet established for the profile or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections”.
The doctors say that they use the medicine when "no other output".
The Turkish studies of the Stambul Group conduct a small study on the use of chlorokines in accordance with the cycle and vitamins A, C and D.
Great studies are conducted at the University of Duke and the University of Oxford.
The Medical School of New York University in Langone examines the safety and efficiency of hydroxychlorokin use.
China’s clinical experiences in Uhana and Shanghailand showed that the fabric was “only effective”.
35 patients in Shanghai, who received this medicine, received a negative result in average of 4 days, while 45 patients who did not receive therapy were 11 days.
In Uhana, 240 patients with pneumonia were observed, a half of whom was received favirivir, and the second half is unmifenovir.

Its use may be unsafe for pregnancy patients or for patients trying to adjust.
The results of one studie, a higher combination of antivirus drugs “lopinavir” and “ritonavir” (Caletra), have been concluded that “the efficiency of the use of medicines has not been detected”.
The medicines were prepared to inhibit HIV-replication by association with protease.
The group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicines to find a combination that will be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, the re-profilation of medicines that have been specially developed for HIV and IADA.
WHO included a combination of lopinavaira and ritonavia in the international “Solidarity”.
Remdesivir was also created by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections. In the past, Gilead Sciences discovered that the Remdesivir was in vitro against the anti-vitro activity of filo, pneumopho, paramix and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of resistence through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transfers.
In the first case of the study, the remedivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, which is currently conducted by several clinical trials, including two university clients of Cleveland; one is conducted in patients with a moderated form of disease, and another, in patients with more difficult form.
Three clinical trials are currently conducted for the internal introduction of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized in a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italia).

COVID-19 is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed from clinical trials, many trials of such vaccine continue to be taken.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Protection (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could be obtained before 18 months.
In April, five candidates for vaccine on the safety investigation of phase I.
Virus COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, the major increase in this disease was spread throughout the world, which led to significant investment once the vaccine and investigations were involved in it.
Many organizations for the dilution of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are using geneome.
As announced in April, the key tasks of CEPI's initiative once a vaccine are to ensure the needed speed, production powers, scaling and global access.
In April, the CEPI reported that at the beginning of 2020, in the investigation phase and times, there were 10 different technological forms for creating effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the forms included in the safety investigation of phase I:
Nuclear acid (DNA and RNK) (in phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, irRNC-1273)
Virus vector (with phase I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologycs, adenovirus vector type 5)
As the CEPI reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are located at early stages of time, 78 of them are used in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); it was further stated that 37 vaccines were added, but there are little general information (previously at the planning stage or once).
A preliminary test for safety and immunity is carried out at stages I-II, as normally randomized, placebo-controlled, and in several parts with the simultaneous definition of more precise and effective doses.
Stage III of the reviews usually includes more participants, including the control group, which is tested for the effectiveness of the prevention of disease and is at the same time followed by the side effects of optimal doses.
From 79 candidate vaccines actively located (at beginning April 2020), 74 are not yet related to human experiences (all are still at the stage of doclinical studies).

On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of the Medical School of Pi^Sburgh reported that PittCoVacc, the possible vaccine against COVID-19 on the mouse, stated that “MNA had introduced SARS-CoV-2 S1, with the answers to the antigen-specifical anti-specifical anticipation [mouse] which had been shown in 2 weeks after immunisation”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the Waterloo University announced the potential vaccine on the basis of DNA, which may be released in the form of narrow expiry.
With the DNA bacteophas, it will be multiplied inside the bacteria and developed without virus-like parts that can stimulate the immune system to you against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three United States universities united IBM supercomputer resources in accordance with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google resources.
Vaccinas have geological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits, besides the characteristics of preventing diseases.
Another randomized study conducted in Australia includes 4170 health careers.
The developed vaccines may be insecure or ineffective.
Earlier studies on the evaluation of the efficiency of vaccine using animal models, for which COVID-19 is characterized, such as ACE2 transgenous mouse, other animal and lower premiums, indicate the need for measures to maintain biosecurity infections with levels of 3 live virus and the international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
The vaccines against SARS and MERS were protested on animal models.
In 2020, there are no medicines or protection vaccines that would be safe and effective for people.
According to the works held in 2005 and 2006, the identity of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical relief was a priority for governments and public health institutions worldwide.
When MERS began to spread, the SARS study, which was conducted at that moment, could be a standard for vaccine and therapeutic anti-infection MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which passed the phase I of clinical trials on people, and three more vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on a virus vector and were found in the process of dilution, two adenvirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The theory of the negotiation was extended in the public networks, confirming that the COVID-19 virus is no new and that the vaccine already exists.
Implementations in networks cited the words of some patients who claimed that the genetic follow-up of other coronavirus coronavirus, such as the coronavirus SARS, and vaccines for these stomachs.
Coronavirus is a disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19), which is a infectious illness which is caused by a heavy respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most exposed symptoms include the disorder, the respiration and the disorder.
Other symptoms may include the feeling of calamity, muscle pain, diarrhoea, bitter pain, loss of disorder and life pain.
Since the first symptoms have been shown to the sickness, it is usually about five days, but it can also be varied from two to fourteen days.
The majority of the cases resulted in symptoms, but in some cases, the disease is overcome to virus pneumonium and polyorganic failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million infections in 210 countries and regions were registered, more than 153,000 people were killed from this disease.
More than 568 000 people have been healthy, and the virus is mainly spread in close contact with each other, often through microscopic capsules that are distributed in air, chickeny, or ↓.
Although these capsules are formed at the exhaust, they usually represent a threat, falling on the ground or on the surface, but are not transferred through the air at large distances.
People are also injured by injury of a threatened surface, and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live in the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most infected during the first three days after the symptoms have occurred, although its distribution may be → before symptoms and at more light stages.
Medical masks are recommended for patients with suspicion on illness, as well as for those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks are different: some news recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others need it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment of COVID-19 virus.
The local distribution of diseases was registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Insufficients may not have any symptoms or have symptoms of grippe such as rubbers, scarlets, furniture, and clothing.
External symptoms include distressed respiration, persistent pain or feeling of disturbance in the breast, consciousness, distress with awakening, breathing or mouth; if there are above-numerated symptoms, it should be immediately addressed for medical assistance.
The symptoms of the disease of the spirits may be observed, such as kissing, disturbance or pain in the throat.
In different proportions, iron-coated symptoms are also observed, such as heat, fluid and diarrhoea.
The cases of the disease registered in China were mostly shown by the feeling of disturbance in the breast and part of the heart.
In some cases, sickness can progress in the development of pneumonia, polyorganic failure, and then death.
This is called an incubation period.
The incubation period COVID-19 is usually five and six days, but it can be varied from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of the symptoms begin to be shown within 11,5 days after the infection.
The role of such unsensitive carriers in the transmission of diseases is still not fully, but the data predict that they can contribute to the distribution of infections.
Percentage of infected people with an unsimptomatic illness now is not known, it is only being studied; therefore, the Korean control and profile of diseases (KCDC) reported that in 20 per cent of all cases and hospitalizations on virus during the illness of the disease was unsensitive.
The National Health Committee of China began to include unsimptomatic events in its daily report from 1 April; from 166 cases of infections registered this day, 130 (78 per cent) were rejected without symptoms at the time of the test.
And the mocrothes, and the sulphur may have a big face of virus.
When the sound of the speech is in the air, there is more capsules than normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that the capsules could be extended at a distance of 4,5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is normally not translated by airway, but the National Scientific Academy suggested that the transmission of parts of virus in bio-erozol paths, and the testing of the air, which was translated to the air collectors of the corners, was the identity of the virus RNA.
Medical procedures such as intubation and cardiovascular reanimation (CRL) can lead to the spread of exhaust products and, therefore, to spread the virus in the air.
There are also dangers that the virus can be spread through the efficiency, however, the risk is considered low. The virus is the most counterfeit when people have symptoms; the distribution of virus may be until the symptoms appear, but the risk is small.
The collaborators of the Centre of Protection and Control of Disabilities (ECDC) claim that it is not clearly clear how easy the virus is spread, however, that one of the diseases usually affects 2 to 3 other people. The virus is able to survive from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that the virus was able to live on the carton surface during one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylen) and on the non-governmental station (AISI 304) until three days, and 99% of the melted surface is to 4 hours.
However, these indicators are varied depending on the heat and temperature.
The weight and the potential means in their proper use have sufficient effect in combating the depression: the vial distorts the green vial protection layer, dea-virus, and also can remove it from the top of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconychloride and chloride gluconin (chirurg’s dissinficiating means) are less effective against this virus. In the course of an investigation conducted in Hong Kong, the models were taken in the middle after two days after hospitalization.
Five of the six patients showed the first test the highest to the blood virus, and the highest content of the blood virus was detected on the second day of testing.
The severe heavy coronavir syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new heavy coronavir respiratory syndrome, first found in three persons with pneumonia from a group with anxious respiratory disease registered in Uhana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also met in the family of coronavirus.
Without the body of the body, the virus is a bitumin, which covers its protective clothes. SARS-CoV-2 textile with original SARS-CoV.
Easy is a body that is the most underlying effect of COVID-19, since the virus is coming into an angiotensine-converting farm 2 (ACE2), which is most exposed to alveo cells of type II.
The virus is associated with ACE2 and is located into a cell of hostel with a characteristic glucoprotein, "shipa" (peplomer).
12 per cent of infected people, who have been in the hospital in Uhan, have been diagnosed with an enormous miocardious damage, which often occurs in a severe form of disease.
The frequency of heart-conscious symptoms is high because of the systemic reaction and immune system's distortions, observed in the progress of disease, but the miocardious damage may also be similar to the ACE2 recipients in the heart.
ACE2 recipients are present in the heart in large quantities, since they participate in the body.
The high rate of trombosis (31%) and the Venezuelan trombobol (25%) was observed in patients located in the COVID-19 OIT and could be testified of unfortunate prognoses.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a tropism to ACE2-expressive episodes of respiratory paths, patients with COVID-19 severely observe the symptoms of system hyper-spool.
In particular, it was discovered that Patogen GM-KSF T cells were corrected with recycling of recycling monocytes with IL-6 and serious pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Limfocitarian infiltrates were also found in the cover.
The WHO also opened several testing protocols on this disease.
The polymerate heat reaction in real time (RT-PCR) is a standard testing method.
The test is usually carried out on the respiratory models obtained by the nosalocate glass, but it can also be used as a weapon model or a mocrotic.
Results are usually ready for several hours to two days.
They may also take blood analyses, but they require two blood tests taken in two weeks and their results have no direct value.
China's scientists have succeeded to determine the coronavirus steam and to determine its genetic follow-up so that scientists in laboratory worldwide can automatically develop tests with the method of polimer-speed reaction (CRC) to detect the identity of this virus.
At 4 April 2020, tests on anticipations that could be found in the present time of infection, as well as the possibility of infection in the past were found at a stage of times, but have not yet received a broad distribution.
The Chinese experience of test data studies showed that their accuracy consists of only 60-70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the Office of Control of the Quality of Food and Medicinal Products (FDA) approved the first test for diagnosis, permitted its application at the end of this month. In the indications on the diagnosis issued by the Uganian University hospital, the methods of detection of infection are indicated on the basis of clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
The bilateral majority of the subeuvre focus on the “mate glass” type with peripheric, asymetrical and aposterial distribution is the part of the symptoms detected at the early stage of disease.
Sub-regional domination, the symptom of the bully pool (a decreased deterioration with the variable alveo-completion) and the consolidation are developed as a result of the progress of the disease.
COVID-19 has little data on microscopic disorders and patofisiology.
Basic results of the pathological investigation carried out in the inclusion:
■Roscopy: Plunivit, percaardite, dilution and springs
Four types of virus pneumonies may be observed:
Pneummonia: rubbers, pneumatic hyperplasia, major atomic pneumatics, interstitial burning with limfocytary infiltration and education of multi-electric igant cells
Hard pneumonia: Diffusal alveo disorder (DAD) with a difused alveo-exsuad.
DAD is the cause of a heavy respiratory distress-syndrome (ORDS) and a heavy hypoxemia.
Equipment: Exhibitions in Alveo and Interstitial Fibrosis.
Blood: Difused intra-socious inflation (DVS syndrome); Leecoerithrobastatic reaction
Profilatic measures to reduce the probability of infection include residence in the house, avoidance of humans, frequency swimming hands with milk and water for less than 20 seconds, respecting respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding disturbances to the eyes, nose or mouth with unmounted hands.
CDC recommends to cover the mouth and the nose of the salpet with the snake, or, if there is no salpet, to cover the mouth and the nose by the internal side of the locking zone of the hand.
Following a ≥1 or a chicken, it is recommended to carry out a quality hygiene procedure for hands.
Control and profile of illness (CDC) recommends and use in public areas of tissue masks, in particular in order to translate infections to the unsimptuous period of illness. The distance strategy aims to reduce contacts of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and enterprises were closed in the framework of these measures, the movement of citizens and major public activities were cancelled.
Recommendations on distantization are also subject to the recommendations that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) each other.
Medical medicines with an efficiency against COVID-19 do not exist. Since the completion of vaccine is expected not before 2021, the main part of the COVID-19 distribution is decreased by the epidemic epidemy, which is “output on the plate”.
The CDC also recommends to raise hands with milk and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting a toilet or when a strong arm is threatened, as well as before and after eating, ≥ 20 seconds, and after eating.
The CDC also recommends to use a dezinfect spirit content (spearted contents of at least 60 per cent) a means for hands, but only in cases where weapons and water are not available.
These sums are used as an antimicrobial activity of the isopropanol or isopropanol.
It is used to remove bacteria in a spiral and is not a suitable antiseptic antisept.
Glycerol is added as an engineer.
Patients have been shown a supporting therapy, which may include infusion, oxygen support, as well as support of other vulnerable life-related organs.
CDC recommends those who doubt that it is infected by virus to carry out a normal medical mask.
The Ecstracorporal Membral of the Organization (ECMO) has continued to be studied to resolve the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but its advantages are still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that the rules of personal hygiene, healthy life and diet are observed.
The supporting therapy methods may be shown to patients with easily symptom at early stages of disease. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China op ։ Recommendations for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy and pulmonologists have communicated therapeutic recommendations for various free resource institutions — IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specification of the treatment of COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as the first line, some medical agents recommend to choose the benefit of the paracetamol (acetaminephen) compared to ibuprofene.
In order to minimize the risk of transmission of virus, especially in the medical institutions, it is necessary to take precautions in order to implement procedures where air-capital emissions may occur.
The COVID-19 medical agents recommend that the CDC be placed in a air-capital isolator (AIIR) as an additional measures, other than the standard precautionary measures for contacts and air. The CDC recommended the use of individual protection (SIS) during the pandemy.
Recommended individual protection tools: protection chat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical sticks, of the above renumbered means, and of the use of respirators, not of medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved to use under industrial conditions, but the FDA allowed the use of these respirators to be used in a external application permit (EUA).
They are intended to protect parts of the air, such as the air, but no efficiency is guaranteed in the use of the biological agent's specific protection.
If the medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use and protect personal screens or, at least, to make masks automatically in home conditions.
In most cases, COVID-19 is not sufficiently difficult to require experimental ventilation or alternative, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with a respiratory insufficiency with COVID-19 is currently actively examined, there are some tests that intubation can be avoided using a hydrogen channel with intensive air stream or two-level pressure in a dry way.
Not yet, is there any of these two ways for patients in critical condition the same effective as the IFL.
• Doctors make a choice invasive mechanism for invasive ventilation, if available, since this method is strictly spreading parts in air compared to an intensive air flow. The risk of a heavy form of disease for elderly (even 60 years older, especially those who are 80 years older) is far above.
In many developed countries there are no enough hospital cooks for the population, and the resources of health systems are too much to cope with the rare increase of COVID-19 infections in a serious way that requires hospitalization.
Following one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy, 2,3% needed support for ventilation and 1,4% ended.
In China, some 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 finally fall in the reality.
The task to ensure experienced ventilation is complicated, since the intense respiratory distress-syndrome (ARDS), developed in COVID-19, and the gender is more difficult.
IVL with support for the pressure and the DCV is to provide the maximum quantity of oxygen in the coastal and to ensure the minimum damage of their ventilation, which could be developed by pneutorex.
High DCV may not be available in the early models of ventilators.
The potential treatment methods began in January 2020, and there are currently several antivirus medicines in the clinical trials.
The most perceptive is the remdesivir.
Once new medicines may be extended until 2021, some of the tested medicines have already been approved for other purposes or are at the last trials.
Antiviral medicines may be tested in patients with severe disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers participate in the efficiency and safety tests of potential treatment methods. The FDA is a temporary permit to use a reconciliation plasma as a experimental treatment in cases where human life threats seriously or directly.
It was not subject to clinical studies that should be carried out to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched an application aimed at combating the emergency of disease.
The users must enter their name and identity number to log in.
The annex may find a “ close contact” using the monitoring data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is found, the application recommends not only self-isolation, but also sends information to the responsible health bodies. Analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, person recognition technology, mobile monitoring and experimental intellectuals are used to follow infected people and persons with which they are contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed the security bodies to follow the mobile phone data of people who were predicted by the coronavirus.
The measures were taken to ensure the care and protection of persons that could be contacted with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the distribution of Deutsche Telekom virus before the Federal State institutions of Germany and the Robert Koha Institute, the data aggregated on the location of citizens.
In Russia, the character recognition technology was introduced for the detection of karantiers.
The Regional Health Authority of Italy, Julio Galler, reported that citizen network operators reported that “40 per cent of people are still moved in the territory”.
The Government of Germany has conducted a 48-hour programming marapon of outcome days, in which more than 42.000 participants were involved.
The President of Estonia, Carsti Callulaid, also expressed the invitation to seek creative decisions against the distribution of the coronavirus.
Humans may experience stress in relation to karantine, inflammation, the side effects of treatment, or because of fear of self-infection.
The BBC cites Rory O'Connor's words: "Enhanced isolation, unity, health care, stress and economic disaster is the idea of the conditions for human health and well-being."
Sickness may be easy to run with insignificant or missing symptoms that remind other spread diseases of respiratory paths such as normal prostitute.
Patients with a easy form of disease are normally satisfied during two weeks while treating patients with serious or critical forms may be needed from three to six weeks.
Insured women may have a higher risk of receipt of COVID-19's heavy form for other viruses such as SARS and MERS, although there are no data from COVID-19. Some people COVID-19 may be vulnerable and injury.
The COVID-19 faces with the most severe period of disease can rapidly progress in a intense respiratory distress-syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganic insufficiency.
COVID-19 compliance includes sepsis, anonymous trombocytology, as well as problems with hearts, pockets and sands.
Trombocytical anomalies, especially the increase in protrobine time, were described in 6% of patients in the hospital with COVID-19, while 4% of this group were observed.
Approximately 20 to 30% of COVID-19 patients have increased feeding farms (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days of which five patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients translated into intensive therapy was seven days.
According to the cases of the first stage of disease, the average time of the initial symptoms to death was 14 days with a full range from six to 41 days.
According to the investigation carried out by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the level of kvalitet between men with 2.5.8 per cent and among women is 1.7 per cent.
Histopatological studies on the models testify about the difused alveo disorder of cell fibromixoid exhausts in both.
Virus cytopatic changes were observed in pneumatics.
The outer look of easily reminded the intense respiratory distress-syndrome (ORDS).
In 11,8 per cent of the cases registered by the National Health Commission of China, the problems with the heart were increasing the level of troponine or the detention of heart.
According to the data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems.
Assessments of kvalitet depending on the situation are different from such regional differences, as well as because of methodological work.
Insufficient calculation of cases in easily form may lead to increased levels.
However, the fact that death occurs in the past of the diseases may indicate that the current level of life is unvaluable.
COVID-19 increasingly developed COVID-19 severe symptoms, and these patients were more frequently needed in intensive therapy or died in comparison with non-commercials.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinics discovered that some patients, healthy from this disease, were reduced to 20 to 30 per cent and their scan was discovered of damage.
After healing, it may also lead to the “After intensive therapy”.
In March 2020, it was not possible to produce a sustainable immunity against the patient's health.
In view of other coronavirs, it is considered likely, but it was also reported that after the COVID-19 sanction of the coronavirus tests were still local.
In these cases, it is considered that there was a timely period of illness, not a repeated injury.
It is considered that the virus is natural, has animal origin and is a infectious disease.
The fact that the virus origin was not, but the distribution of the infection was almost completely stated by human transfers to humans until December 2019.
The study of the first 41 cases under the COVID-19, held in the Lancet in January 2020, calls on 1 December 2019 on the early date of the first case of disease.
According to the official data recorded by the WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are usually used for quantity.
All figures are varied depending on the region and the time of the distribution of diseases, and they also affect testing volumes, quality of health systems in the treatment schemes, as well as in the beginning of the emergency of disease and population parameters such as age, half and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO has been affected by the MCB-10: U07.1 in cases of death under laboratory infection SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for cases of death from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory laboratory infection SARS-CoV-2.
According to the statistical data of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global quantity of ≥ 6,9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) was represented on 17 April 2020.
This number varies depending on the region. Other methods include the definition of the coefficient of disease results (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients, the result of disease, as well as the definition of coefficient in the result of transmission infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (and diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases), ends.
These statistical data are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain level of population from the time of the infringement to the end of the disease.
Despite not all patients who have been infectioned, such an anticipation may be understood as they have been infected.
In Epi, Castillone d'Ada, a small village of 4600 people, 80 people (1.7 per cent) are not alive.
In the town of Hangelt, the disease was distributed in the festival of the young people, and not all cases of death from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been threatened.
In Netherlands, approximately 3 per cent of the population may have antenites, judged by donor blood indicators.
COVID-19 is an official cause of 69 cases (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemia and levels of differentity for men and women.
According to the investigations conducted in China and Italy, the level of kvalitet above for men.
The largest risk group is men in age of more than 50 years; the breaking in indicators between men and women is only reduced from 90 years of age.
In China, the level of ≥ 2,8 per cent for men and 1,7 per cent for women.
The accurate reasons for this distortion are not, but can be included in genetic and conducting factors.
Gender immunological differences, the less expansion of smoking among women who are associated with men (e.g. hypertension in men in a younger age than women) may be a cause of higher ability among men.
57 per cent of the infectioned men were composed, and 72 per cent of the cases of death from COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the Government of the United States is not a gender statistical on COVID-19.
Scientific studies showed that virus diseases such as Ebol, HIV, grip and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most health careers, especially the medical staff, include women, respectively, have more opportunities to infect them.
On 11 February 2020, World Health has announced the official name of this disease — COVID-19.
Mr. Tedros Adan Geheisus explains: "CO" means "corona", "VI" means "virus", "D" is "sease" (disease) and 19th year when the first exposure was detected: 31 December 2019.
Such a name was chosen to avoid a specific geographic location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by the nomination recommendations aimed at preventing adjustment. The virus, which calls COVID-19, is called a heavy coronaviral syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO uses the terms “COVID-19” and “virus responsible for COVID-19”.
And illness, and the virus itself are usually called "coronavirus".
During the initial invasion in Uhana, China, the virus and disease were usually called "coronavirus" and "Uhanx Coronavirus".
In January 2020, in the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical characters in the names of diseases and viruss, the WHO recommended and used the terms “water respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the Office of the name was ‘COVID-19’ and ‘SARS-CoV-2’.
Because of the range of standard stakeholders, some digital printing services manufacturers are medical materials such as tampons to take the weapons from the nose, as well as IVL equipment details.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic was urgently needed in ventilation, and the supplier was not able to deliver it to the required time, then one of the products was re-profiled and smoked to print 100 packs per night.
Following the first exposure of the COVID-19, the Internet has made a high speed to spread different theories of negotiation, dezination and fashional information about virus, its scales, profiles, treatment and others.
Perhaps humans can be affected by the virus of other animals.
The results of the studies have not confirmed the distribution of virus between wheat, wheat, and cycloth.
There is no approved vaccine from virus or medicinal products for treatment at this time.
Government, academic groups and researchers are currently conducted by various studies of vaccine and medicines from COVID-19.
In March of the WHO, the SOLIDARITY Trial programme (SOLIDARITY Trial), aimed at evaluating the effect of the treatment of four associations, considers the most effective today.
Prepared vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
As SARS-CoV as well as SARS-CoV-2 is in human cells using the ACE2 recipient, the results of previous investigations are therefore used by SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccinations.
First, researchers are trying to create a target-virion vaccine.
The exercise of such virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to address the rapid human body's immune response to the new COVID-19 infection.
Secondly, the establishment of sub-evenical vaccine is aimed at creating a vaccine, which increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain virus subsidiaries.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are addressed to the S-shirt-visible be, which helps the virus to reach the ACE2 farmer.
The third is a time of vaccine based on nuclear acid (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine creation method).
On 16 March 2020, the first cycle of vaccines on four volunteers began in Sietle on 16 March 2020.
The vaccine contains no genetic code copied from the virus that causes disease. Anthousiastic strength was designated as one of the potential problems of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is a characteristic of the risk.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are carried out.
The medicines approved for the treatment of ma ́mia were undertaken in seven tests, four of these studies were on hydrochlorokine or chlorokine.
Reprofiling antivirus medicinal products consists of most Chinese investigations; at the end of April, nine studies have been conducted in the phase III of the Remdesivir.
In April 2020, there was a dynamic review of COVID-19 vaccine and candidates for the treatment of COVID-19, with the same scope, several other antiviral medicines for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorochine and hydrochlorohyne, lopinavire/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in accordance with interferon beta.
In March 2020, data on the efficiency of the use of reddexivir are provided.
Clinin was observed in patients, receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Step III of clinical experiences already occur in the United States, China and Italy. The application of chlorokine, which was previously used for the treatment of Maiae, was considered in China in February 2020, and was predicted.
However, there is a need for a experimental assessment.
Corean and China healthcare bodies recommend and use chlorochine.
The Ughani Institute recommends a specific dose in one gram, but it notes that the duplication of this dose is very dangerous and can lead to the aerodrome.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA was authorised to external use of hydrochlorokine and chlorokine for medical treatment with COVID-19 patients. The 7th issue also indicates interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir, as means of anti-COVID-19.
Prepare the data indicates that the high doses of ribavirin are in vitro to inject SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for a detailed in vivo study, demonstrating the injection of SARS-CoV-2 in low coverages. The studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 should be interacted with the ACE2 recipient with a ship of transmumbed protease series 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chlorokine and hydrochlorokine with azythrome or without it have serious effects that do not allow the medical community to use these treatment methods without more detailed studies. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is not clear.
Hypercytokinemy may be caused as a complication in light stages of COVID-19 heavy form.
The fact is that hydroxilochlorohyne can have hypercytokinetic properties. In the light of a small investigation conducted by the National Health Commission, tocylisumab was included in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
This medicine came to 2 stage of an unrandomized test conducted at the national level in Italy, after the results of its use in patients with a severe disease.
In accordance with the analysis of the ferritin heat for the detection of cytokines, it is intended to oppose such factors that, as it seems, are the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA was approved antagonist of the interlacin-6 recipient based on the retro-thematic studies for the treatment of steroid refracter cytokins, which was caused by other reasons by the T-cellotic CAR treatment.
Today, there are no randomized and controlled evidence of that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of a cytokine freedom syndrome.
The transmission of clean-up-and-contained anticipations produced by immune systems of patients with health from COVID-19 is now considered as a non-vaccinated method of passive immunisation.
This test was tested when treating patients with SARS, but its results were uncertain.
The neutralisation of the virus is a expected effect that the passive treatment of antenders can ensure protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, the use of other mechanisms, such as the antithylosismic cell cytoto and/or fagocytosis, may be used.
Other forms of passive anti- anti-terapie, such as the use of monoklonal anthers, are located at the stage of times.
Increase may be increased the use of the reconvolution of blood fluid, which consists of the blood hepatitis of patients and contains anticorps against this virus.
Coronaviral diseases, high-like syndrome group
Le Venilan, the doctor of Uhana's central clinic, who later infected and died from COVID-19 after reporting the distribution of virus.
