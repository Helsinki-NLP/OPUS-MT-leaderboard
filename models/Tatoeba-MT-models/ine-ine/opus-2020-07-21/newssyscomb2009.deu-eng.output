Triumph of the legalists in Austria, in total they come to 29 Pro
A fair weakness of both parties of the current large coalition and a clear strengthening of the right institutionist parties, following the first provisional results, was the preceding Parliament's elections from Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian Popular Party (AEP), where the position of the former President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the kippe.
In contrast, the chairman of the covenant for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, for a triumphale back in the Federal Policy.
According to the current results, the social democracy (SPÖ) remains at 29.8% of the votes in the country, but the last elections in 2006 loses 5.5% of the votes.
The UVP is still worse, which loses nearly nine pro of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two large parties in the Austrian after-government history, and especially in the population party who had requested the previous elections, this is a really disastrophe result.
On the beginning of July, when the UVP was out of the coalition, the people party had a clear view before the SPÖ.
However, the electors have probably punished the party for that they have left the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there was a specule over a possible retreat of the President of the Parties and of the Vice-Cancler Wilhelm Molterer.
Observators believe that this may be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the Parties' representative on Monday.
Such development would probably take the way to the most probably out of the election deck, so to renew the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In the light of the strengthening of both right-evolutive parties - the freedoms (FPÖ) have temporarily received 18%, the BZÖ eleven pro­jects of votes - but the social democrats have formed their protection, which can be repeated in 1999 when the population party with the peoples with the peoples of Abăn (as the FPÖ was yet unified, in 2005 she had fallen from the BZÖ) in relation to a common government, which had even made sanctions from the European Union.
It is obvious that Jörg Haider, who has already explained that he is ready to cooperate with each party and goes from a return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
In this Parliament, the Green Partie, however, has easily lost and has been removed from the Austrian Political Parties to the fifth place.
There is no other party who has probably held the four-percent duty and therefore has not come into Parliament.
Blackzenberg: Relations with India can be coaled
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech Competitives who have been accused in India because of the unusual collection of buyers, it could, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, come to a certain depreciation of the Czech-Indian relations.
This stressed the Minister in New York after the present meeting with the Indian official colleagues Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't make it clear, then it's sure that it's going to a certain refrigeration," he explained after a meeting that was located on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters, the executives can only be difficult.
On the other hand, he concluded that in the case of Petr Schvácha, who was released by the accusation and received a penalty penalty, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, where the legal proclaimment falls in the matter.
"His problem could be understood," said the Minister.
For Emil Kuchera, who was condemned in three years of freedom punishment, it would be the best if he would be at a professional instance.
He could likely ask for freedom for the caught and wait in freedom for his judgment, as the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself as well in negotiations.
"He recommends an appointment at a court, then he will make him a pleasure in question," said the chief of the Czech Diplomatie.
The only way that the Czech side can be involved in the whole of the matter is to give the judged "competent legal support" to the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such a help will already be offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in getting closely contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
"The Inders also give it," said Blackzenberg.
At the same time, the Czech Presse Agency CHTK, before partners, confirmed the Czech Republic to meet the problem of the Czech Entomologists.
"We really believe that it is a big error to arrest and complain these Czech companions," he said.
An answer to the question is whether he has received the request from the Indian side to discuss the matter as the Minister said.
"I have already been very much spoken," he only stated.
A Czech recruits the ring around the sea
It approaches a electronic card which is designed on the sea and the border areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent but a small point, lost in the ocean blue.
"The island belongs to the island and with her the border sea.
The area is as large as the continent itself," as the Italian Jurist Luigi Santosuosso, which belongs to the thirty-cooperative team of the UN division for Ocean and Sea.
His boss, the Division Director, the Czech Jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and adds it.
Here are workelan and pleasure.
The sea-based causes a little small world, which is rich to natural sources.
Here is the oil to be found, increasingly inherited and other non-creasing raw substances, but also in a longer known living organs, for example the key to develop a medication against cancer.
A sea background, greater than the festival
Today, the landscape states have highly reported their attachment to the new sea areas.
After a United Nations Convention, they make use of their rights to which they agreed in Montego Bay in 1982 in Jamaica.
It is, in particular, the area of the continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred miles away from the border of a country to the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exhaustive approach to all sources of the continental shelf.
" simplified, as continental shelf is considered the part of the sea ground and its soils, which represents a natural continuation of the continent under the surface of the sea.
He exceeds the borders of the sea, often the border of two hundred miles of the economy area,” explains Miculka.
The request submitted by the Commission's country to establish the external limits of the continental scale must be submitted by a large scientific and technical documentation which is subject to many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to give the Commission legal and technical support.
The Commission has already negotiated more than five applications, even from Russia, Brazil, 日, Ireland and New Zealand.
To this end, only the three years mentioned countries have succeeded.
On a international echo, the success of success, which as the first country could clearly increase its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the sea ground, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1,6 million quadrimeters, so about six times more than the size of the State.
Both countries have invested millions of people in the investigations.
The winning that brings them out of the use of the sea ground will, as they promise, have an unvaluable value.
More States will gradually submit their requests.
You can do this for years since they have the "Monto Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean ground begins by the Convention as the "general inheritance of mankind".
There's no more a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted a international institution established by the Convention.
"The ground of the sea is not a golden grassland," means, with some transmission, Director Miculka and f ́, "whose areas are legally defined and the system are contractually enhanced."
Czech Republic of the Pacific
Today, part of the sealand belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former East Block within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This received 1991 because of the Convention, as well as the investors of some few other states, the status of a "bad-break investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the area of RiverClipperton in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something greater than the former Czech Slovakia.
The sea ground is covered there, it is a species of Tatra on the sea.
"Fortress can be found in a area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetall credits containing nickel, buffer, cobalt and Mangan, such as another jurist, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the Division Rober Sandev brings such a confidence as a pattern.
She recalls a small cartoffle or, with a little fantasy, the claiming scheme that has raised the legend to the Golem to life.
Dutch special forces were in the place of freedom of ice
The Egyptian Government had requested help from Germany to solve the gesel crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
In the circumstances of the release of 11 tourists in Egypt, more details will be made.
The salvation action was also shared indirectly, according to the information of the Defence and Internal Ministry.
In this case, both the specialists of the Federal War and the employees of the GSG 9, the Federal Police, the Federal Crime Lamp, as well as the logistic experts of the Technical Aid Work at the place of freedom.
As the Ministers continued to communicate on Monday, however, the German powers were not needed because the captives left their prisoners and fled when they recognized signs for a violent release.
The Egyptian Government adopted the aid offered by Germany to join them as a support force in place.
"This has not been happy," said a speaker of the Federal Ministry.
The traveling group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and eight Egyptian followers were driven out in South Egypt on 19 September.
After the destruction in a wilderness region in South Egypt, the islands in the border of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Tshad were split up and removed.
The efficiency of the islanders remained unexpected, as well as the details of the freedom or possible solvency payments.
The rescued ones arrived in Cairo, inter alia.
Steinmeier said that the free friends are located in the obhut of the German message.
For details of the release, he did not express himself.
In Berlin there was no information when they returned to Germany.
According to the "image" citizens, the five holidays and the special ships will be exploded with a airbus of aircraft and take place on Sunday in Germany.
US Representative House refuses salvation package
The first room of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion severe salvation package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went out into the depth.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US representative house has refused the Government's salvation package for the financial markets.
Despite all the calls of President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which the chaos should be entered into the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the guards were trying to doubt the critics still to convince the 700 billion of a serious package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiations leader, had called the ladies to agree, even if the plan was unfair.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Moreover, during the vote of the Dow Jones, about more than six per, or about 600 points.
The reasons were the concerns of investors that could divorce the State salvation package.
He recovered soon before the end of the vote, so that, after the announcement of the sheet, he would be destroyed again.
Experts now consider more serious turbulences on international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, the approval of both the Member State and the Senate must be required.
Increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travelers:
In travel bookings for the coming months, the conversion in comparison to the previous year is clear - for the winter season even about 30 Pro.
Despite weak conjuncture views, the loss of the Germans remains untrue.
In the bookings for the winter season, the travel offices had a 31-pro-pro-place in the previous year, as the German traveling band (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
The study of the market research institution GfK also provides booking numbers already provided for the last months.
Thus, the road boards for October, around 11 Pro · compared to 2007, shared the DRV.
Based on these results, the numbers of the GfK evaluated monthly booking data of 1200 German travel Offices and calculated for the total.
The travel bookings held up to the end of August 2008 were found.
Because of the weak course, travels were particularly asked to the United States, the DRV shared.
Here the booking growth is around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece and the homefields were particularly asked for travel targets in Germans.
The DRV president Klaus Laepple explained in the case of pauschal travels.
In view of growing energy and food costs, the costs "for customers are better calculated than for individually organized holidays".
Finance could include consumers, among other things, save by early booking processes or all-inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
Even the sommer months were very well worth it, so that it would be a turn-up plan for the previous year - even though another part means the number of Germans who undertaken a trip, compared to the previous year.
My first party of October
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless shot, birds from liter-krucks and Promis in Designer-Dirndln.
A show debt.
Susanne Kron Zucker and I have not much together.
She's blown, television modern and has a mathematical dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm Studentin, and my clothes are second hands.
But one thing connects us: Three minutes on the show, the photographs are already broken on us and knips the memory cards fullly - very funny and it is at my first visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Billig Dirndl seems to meet his purpose.
As the shown tour and north of the white crowd quarter are seated, the well-being remained in the trail until the date.
But only once on the thersian point, everything is so bad.
Almost everybody takes Dirndl or Lederhosn; no one looks at or touches penalty - everything is totally normal.
It's a rare shock at the chokobanan station, but my girlfriend's shoes.
A monastery notes me that I would have wrongly linked the shoes: "Links highest free, middle girlfriend, forgive right, forbid behind."
Heavenly, I'm driving my back to left.
"Passt," he said and laughed.
Others do less upcoming for subtil flower technology and → slipped films on which "To dungk to get dressed!" states and stretch the naked interval.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes named Bob, comes from England and visits the first party of October.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long "ooooo".
He told me this after he decided his earlier drinking measure.
Just along with one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a Mâmer.
So, Bob is one of the reasonable "Wildbyslers".
Others don't have the happiness to get the alcohol out of this way.
Apart from eight hours a night, sanities run over the festival that must take care of the poor shooters.
The hospitals always come up in the road - always four once slipped a overwhelming tragedy of cells to cell.
This works as with most shown visitors: empty, completely back.
Whoever lies in the promille guard under the plane, you don't see.
"These are those who are better packing," called one of the sanitaries to ask me and disappeared in the fucking.
Name of the accident sacrifice given by the police
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after it was taken in Essex by a vehicle was given.
Carole Paulson, resident in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was shared in the accident on Friday morning on the Shenfield Road in the middle of the city.
She was brought to Queen's hospital at Romeford, but she died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the decree on easily running.
Meanwhile, he was released on the case.
Turkey extends the diplomatic Horizon
For a long time before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the powers were interested in deeply involved in Turkey's territory.
On the remote side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the most fair relics of this scared, census effort.
The Hydarpasha Bahnhof was made by the two German Architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the travelers tell you.
The building is located at the end of the train stream with a tour on each corner of the front side and looks like any provincial German Rathaus.
The stone is crazy.
The entire building is located around
But if you are inside the populated cart button, there is no doubt about the inheritance of the foreign, whose western access was this.
The bathroom was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was later in the imperialist game, had to implement before his ambitions, to dominate the Middle East, through a traveling connection to Bagdad, and further after what Saudi Arabia is today.
Nevertheless, Germany's imperialists claimed that during the First World War.
His railway chineses were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, produced by the unwindable limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British powers removed from Egypt and forced the Turks and their German associates from Palestine and
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Bahnhof.
In 1917, a munition trip flew into the air, with the artificial dach was cut off.
Turkey sources say it was Sabotage.
Since then, it has fallen quietly, pass away from the story.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolic, is the port to Anatolia and all of it, to highlight the extension of the diplomatic Horizon of Turkey.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development, the ACP, has introduced a good new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a existence of the neighborhood.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has relations with Israel and ́s, the Palestinian spliters groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and, of course, to the European Union and the United States.
In order to evaluate the data of this new foreign policy, I have held the night in the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading external experts of the ACP, the Turkish Deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about a half hours later, after a holprid driving on glasses that produced the same step of the old world in the documentation "The Night Mail", I came in the Turkish capital, which is considered as a new city, for the new world's stateholder, the Osmanian past.
However, the ACP, which is for its islamistic roots, represents a paradigmen change in the Turkish unit.
This has caused some misbeliefs in the west, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the AKP's main business, a specially added, ultramodern stone and steel construction, in a developing village, around half-complete purchases and kitchens in which the medium manager was in charges both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a medium-right politician of almost every other European political party.
Look, Krawatte, I'm sure he even got a Blackberry.
"The objective of the external policy of the party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its direct neighbouring countries.
The Cald War was an exception," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from her territory.
Today, she has to look at East and West at the same time.
It doesn't have one or another.
You have to do both.
"But I'm sure that Turkey could sometimes," I asked, "which has been forced to decide?"
"The Turkish," he said, "he wouldn't have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point, nearly everyone with whom I spoke here, almost routinely said: The relations of Turkey, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Kaukasus and around the Black Sea, are also of benefit for Europe and the United States, as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems to be the message, Europe can, in the oversee, lead as a whole on equivalent railway chineses, lead Asia and the Mediterranean East.
Back in the Hydarpasha Bahnhof, after another long-term sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu who had seen the building of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they were to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East now, to large parts, could lie in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the flights that should bring me back over the Bosporus, I noticed that Turkey was always called "the cra's man of Europe" in those days.
At least that time, there seemed not to be a lot of doubts about which continent should have an attachment to this fascinating country.
In the memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley (convocation on 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmoniker and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth, Proteus, in the next year.
He was thinking about youths to 21 years, but when the Chor last time in 1979, some of us had been in the end of 20 years, we refused to leave the Chor.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form exchanger) was for the preparation and ability of the Chores, to take into attack any music piece presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messias, whether a capella or with a full orchester.
The musical discipline of such a young core often was amazing, always exciting, and was unique and only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his disgrace for the music that never was after years.
How often death thought to us "laying music for himself."
He refused to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His type of direction was absolutely clear and precise, but never overwhelmed.
How high the musical level was, he always requested a more higher.
John Frayn Turner says:
If any director had to be shot to the rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two years, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmoniker.
In the last 40 years, I wrote critics for over hundreds of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by a single - often I was inspired by them.
Mord Handley was that rare combination of size and personal humility.
He accepted the directors who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two of them in the world.
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25) you write that " he took again the education of the economic stories in Oxford and received a Houblon-Norman research stamp in 1950... while he studied at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctor.
This is a conclusion from a author note in Woodruffs book "Jensideit of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953, he was a dog of the economic stories at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British Kautschuk industry under the maintenance of Professor J.D. Chambers, published later in 1958 as the "British Kautschuk industry".
He was 1950-1951 in the United States at the tour of a Houblon-Norman Stipendi · and delivered the summer from 1952 to the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham finally and went to Illinois.
It's not, why Woodruff wanted to cut this part of his runway.
J. Vicente Resino on the philological faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photos are fantastic in black-white, in the documentary style.
They made me careful about them because of their lightness and the power they stretched out, as they always acted with respect to the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments."
Second of the excellent sale in Honda.
In November, Honda was arrested with the confusion of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Since his precedent model had a large internal room, this large space limosine offers a significantly greater.
It also comes to the technical fines that enables even more comfortable drives and gases.
Changes before the previous revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz shows a similar line to the precedents, the changes made by this great limosine are numerous.
In addition, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism should be shown.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, you must say that this new Jazz appears six years later after the first generation had occurred on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other producers, renewed this model for a short time.
Although Honda Jazz is less in Europe, this model is a phenomenon regarding its sale on other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the most broken car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz was on the market, only in Japan was a million models.
The second paragraph was the old continent, with a half million busy cars in six years.
However, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese enterprises had a total number of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected rates are 10,000 cars, which are 17% of the accepted growth on the market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has totally secured 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which are 6,7% of the total market in Hunda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the leaders in Spain expect to overcome 2 000 Jazz models per year.
It is considered precisely that the new Honda Jazz model is enabled to disturb the supply in Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the market hope to complete the year with a total extent of 22,000 models, which are less than in 2007, a 16% decrease.
Despite this purchase, Honda has increased its market share in Spain against the previous year (1,6 %) to 1,8 %.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to achieve 2 % in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda sets out the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybridaut with 5 doors and a compact size of 4,7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to survive about 200 000 models per year throughout the world.
According to the market assessments of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are being replaced in the United States, while the rest of the share is distributed to the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of the insight on the market is expected for the first months of the year, for the first time his public presentation will be placed in January in Valencia.
In view of the first generation, the new Jazz in all its sizes.
His length is 3.90 metres (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 metres (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 metres, which leads to the assumption that he has increased 5 centimeters.
The height, however, does not change and remains 1.52 metres.
In addition to increased dimensions, the internal space is also increased.
This success is, on the part of the new space flexibility programme and the other side, the central position of the cartridge container, to enhance a solution that was also used for Jazz's previous model.
Furthermore, the capacity of the Kofferra, which has a system of the double load area, reaches up to 339 litres, so 19 litres greater than the capability of Kofferra of the first generation.
It must be highlighted that these measures are available in the version of a 1.4 liter gas engine, since the capacity of the Kofferra of Honda Jazz with a 1,2 liter-benzine motor is 379 litres.
In addition to improvements, other than associated elements such as leadership or the possibility of panoramic windows, a improved access to the sites is offered.
The opening angle of the doors is 80 degrees, with the first Jazz had only 67 degrees.
Also the engines of the second generation of Jazz are new.
At the beginning of its confusion, this small model has 2 exhibitions of gas engines: 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both variants have the i-VTEC system which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 exhausts, has excellent technical performance and simultaneously makes a drehmomental performance for the entire time of the engine.
The first variant with 1,2 liter produces the performance from 90 PS at 6 000 rotations with a maximum drehmoment from 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gas engine - the Jazz's processing model reached 78 PS - has 5,3 litres of gas and CO2 output of 125 grams.
In view of the operational engine that reached the previous generation of 83 PS, he can now come to 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5,4 litres of gas and 128 gram CO2 exhausts.
`Auto-Biene', avoiding Collisions
In order to promote the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the birds.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight returns to the heat behaviour and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The Technical Development Engineers of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of Tokio University (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the leader of technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-year Nissan security schedule.
This robot will ensure that the cars of this mark are able to avoid the collisions.
With the currency of the flight, each bottle builds its own, oval-formed aircraft, which is very similar to Nissan security schedule.
However, the most important is the facette nucleus of the bones that can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to flight in your personal airspace without interruption.
To imitate the Rundum perspective, the technicians developed the Lazer Range Finder (LRF).
He notes the barriers that are located before the BR23C at the distance to two meters and lies in the 180 degrees radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a border microprocessor, which is directly translated to a signal for preventing the collision
`In the moment when a barrier is observed, the small robot will imitate the fucking flight and immediately change the direction by turning his rats around 90° or more to avoid the collision.
The largest subsequence of other population systems is that this development is absolutely instinct.
If it wasn't so, the robot could not be able to respond with sufficient difficulty to avoid obstacles, "affirms Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
In the subsheed to a bone, the robot can not move up or down, but also not oversee; he can only move to two dimensions and to the direction that allows him to turn his roads and not to the infinite directions and infinite ways as it makes the birds.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in order to avoid the collisions by the small robots.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and to act according to this information.
It does not require to save the information or the intuitive logic of the designed manövers, therefore it can work with only a few thousand KB of the space.
It sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the space.
This is the first step in the development of the technologies for the immediate prevention of the collisions, a technology that prophesyes Nissan in the series of years.
The robot works with lithium polymer battery, which are easier and holds longer than lithium-ion battery.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS processing system through satellite to lead to the goal and to avoid the barriers on the road.
She's at the point before it is loaded with a hypothek.
It must be considered that the United States Financial Ministry, except for a sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without check.
Before the crisis, and to avoid developing the US citizens in hypotheken discussions of the traditional payable banks, a sustainable and informative game for the Internet surfer was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it is said.
Or maybe the `Hotel of the bad credits' or the other.
The aspect of this accommodation and particularly his recipient is to consider one and two and three times whether it is the moment to ask no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is better a page for the teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will be done when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreaming room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it doesn't matter to buy a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the income of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) in its company, with which this would be the first bank in Japan, which issued nine billion, and so 21% of their capital, a renewal, which is to be brought back to a strong case of their rail course.
One week after a provisional agreement had been published, the two banks explained that MUFG 9,9% of Morgan Stanley's stamp will be purchased at a single price of 25,25%, which is a total amount of three billion.
The accepted price is under 19% of the rates of the action from 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion in the acquisition of convertible actions which will be able to ensure a 10% winning and to a price of 31,25%.
Morgan Stanley explained that the world business is performed on the basis of an average average price of 29, therefore 28 % over the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's action falled against 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to 23.07.
'This strategic connection is an important opportunity to clear the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank', explained John Mack, Director-General of the Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which would allow him to expand their business in new areas, but under the view of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also ensures that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more careful attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed during the last days: the last Monday Morgan was clearly explained that it would overcome up to 20% of its actions for about 8.5 billion e.g. to Japan.
'From a week', Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, business leader of the MUFG, we thought that the share would be completely from stammacy.
However, in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and to ensure ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will be paid for its Morgan Stanley action 7% under their rates.
And the business is going to depart about 20% per action with a reduction of winning.
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert the help of its preferential acts into stamps in a year when the names of the MUFG are replaced to more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, so to about 47%.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money delivered by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities to strengthen their big and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to make more precise information on the strategic areas of the two new unions.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to buy a payment amount of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his bie has been sent to the end of August `dumily'.
The last weeks were hard for the group who had to see how their railway course returned around the half, while the price for the insurance against paying incapacity was rapid to the height.
This price returned Monday, but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only `relevant' of the large investment banks at the Wall Street after the concurrence of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the uptake of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion, part of Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic renewed the socialism of the 21th century.
This is the common predetermination of the Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivians Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
That third was the one who followed the example of his equivalents and friends this Sunday, the plan for a new constitution.
The mission is fulfilled because the public results of 80% of the electoral votes corresponded to 64% of the people's vote with 'Yes'.
According to these results, 28% were equal to 'No', 7% of the election notes were invalid and 0.7% were released empty.
In order to prevent the Constitutional project, a vote must be achieved more than the help of all the votes issued.
On Sunday, two issues made in the elections and a statement of a non-governmental organization have announced a clear victory for 'Yes' and prophesy to him 63% up to 70%.
On Sunday night on Monday, Rafael Correa had also requested the winning of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution triumphed in overwhelming manner', he had in Guayaquil, the seat of the Government 280 miles south-west of Quito, and welcomed the equatorian.
Of course, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chávez and Morales, but also by the Chilean Similar Michelle Bachelet.
The choice held in silence in accordance with the observation regulation of the United States (OAS) was based on a text of 444 points to ensure the 'new socialism' for which the Chairman was engaged.
The Constitutional project transfers the State Government to the economy by granting it the only right to 'evolution planning' to a country, which is largely of the earthly oil promotion by foreign companies and by the devises sending the emigrants to the country.
The project, which will be provided by the 2006 selected Corree, is also more powerful to the Governing Boss, which will be able to exercise up to two follow-up mandates every four years and will have the possibility to resolve the national assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical and training, which the President has already started, to introduce in this country with 13,9 million inhabitants in which 50% of the population live under the poverty border.
Finally, it also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorian support point as a station of origin for antidrogs.
The 19 prisoners were released in Chad
A Egyptian command started the attack on the leaders of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who were taken captives ago 8 days ago.
You're in Kairo.
The eleven tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were arrested for elf days in the wilderness, were healthy in this Monday afternoon and unwantedly returned to the main city of Egypt.
Tomorrow they were released by a Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in the state, the ships at 15.30 a.m. reached the military point al-Maza directly beyond the international airport of Kairo at the board of a special aircraft.
They were directly brought to the board of a helicopter in the hospital of Maadi, a foreign quarter of Kairo, to be investigated there.
They are all pleasing to 'best health' and to the deducters have not been paid a ransom, explained by the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the Rollfield.
After being taken captive on 19 September at a foreign car Saphari at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of prisoners was still brought from a hidden group of 35 unrecognized deducers.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four leaders, a borderman and the director of the Agency of Egypt, Safari.
A Egyptian security responsibility explained that 30 members of the special units, from the Board of two helicopters, have started the attack on the night, shortly before the morning breakfast.
'By the two sides of the shoes fell, and the help of the leaders was killed, the rest of them fled,' said the responsibility that wanted to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special units were sent to Sudan, where they received support by German and Italian commands.
The top of the Italian diplomatian Franco Frattini reported from the rad where he was just there, played about the role, secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units', he explained without further details.
He also concluded that a ransom was paid.
At the earlier night, the Sudanese army claimed to have shot a landing vehicle at a patrol, where the deductors were from which they were six, including the leaders, killed and two arrests.
The army explained that they were associated with a group of rebells from Darfour, the movement of Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which was on the basis of this movement immediately.
Letters - The quiet majority of the culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes lines and is a central topic of the current election battle.
That's better.
But a area of our cultural life remains in memory.
Who will rise up and appropriate the natural sums which will be granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are fatiguing?
What more will it be to remind the Federal Government that it reduces its memories and culturally significant buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that our culture is effective?
Did you know that the French Government provides 3.5 million euros only for the aurration of the chinous lock in Loiretal?
Our neighbors are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the culture of the American culture belongs to, and that all citizens, all deputy and all government concerns must be rejected, even in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the Congregation of History Societies Quebec, at least 40,000 people who are collected in 211 historical societies are attempting to intensify their history, to save the number of archives and to receive the archaeological residues.
They are also often the guardians of our culturer be, which protest with the power of disturbance, when promotors and decision-making leave their Bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten peacemakers.
When will there be a bathroom for history and culture?
Benelux Governments of the Fortis Bank
With a part of constitution, the Benelux states of the Belgian-Netherlands Fortis Bank in Turbulencies will take arms: the three States provide the Bank and Insurance Institute, which is also in Hungary, in total EUR 11,2 billion.
The Governments of the European Central Bank, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the representative of the European Commission.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis which has been stopped since one year, so decisions that are now taken in relation to the bank may have a character of presidency.
In the meaning of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three States purchase the relevant shares of the bank about 49 Pro.
The Bank will probably exhaust a part of its shares, before all the insurances covered by the Netherlands ABN Amro last year.
Fortis' acts have started a steady train last week, and in the second week's half a series of crisis scenarios have already occurred.
However, the analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a floor.
The value papers of the Institute have fallen to a 14-year-old depth by 12% on Friday.
Since Janders, the value of the shares was decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current action rate, the market value of the group is 14 billion euros, which is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion teure’ananic salvation package and the uncertainty of the markets is deemed to be able to carry fortis action.
However, on Monday, the courses were easily made.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx was appointed as a new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also searching for a buyer, but it has not been interested in a business boat.
The Belgian Government was trying to pursue - no investor would delay his money, he called it.
No panic has been broken up by the customers, the bank's owners have not been disturbed.
In Hungary, the Fortis is aware of ownerships, but it also calls her own leasing.
Fuchs in the street
As a result of human medicinal consumption, life and hospital in America are often refusing to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts ensure that data could be uncontrolled.
"The data protection programmes are linked to the approval of the concerned.
These should be in independent hand, elsewhere we trust the hosts in the fuch" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the follow-up of data.
Insurance shall determine taxes and payment amounts in the case of damage depending on the health status of the customer, and if the risk is too high, the insurance will not be completed.
Previously, the customer was sent to an investigation, and the Treaty was only concluded in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Dick experienced a much more favorable method for the time: With the client's performance number, he relates the data of the last half years of the apetics, speaks what preparations have been covered, and the program calculates the disease of the customer and how its health status is.
For example, if he regularly purchases a large quantity of cholesterin less medicines, it followed that his blood fat level is untreated, which would automatically specify it into a risk group.
There are several versions of the program in the course - some define even a risk multiplicator, so that the insurance needs to carry out the paper frame, however there are smaller difficulties.
One of the consequences is that many medicines can be taken for different purposes, such as migration and heat-walls, but also against depression.
Finally, the survey is a high-risic factor in the view of the insurers, while those are not mentioned above.
For the question and processing of data, their own companies have been formed, before they relate to the data, requesting the patients to agree.
In the meantime, they must do that by law, although submissions have not been recognised until the time.
Some companies even process the results of laboratorial studies and connect them to the medical consumption data, which provides a more precise picture of the health status of patients.
More companies have access to data, and the control of their use will be more weak at the same time.
Although there is a own data protection law for health data, its effect is only focused on service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The legislative draft has already been submitted to the Congress, which may also control the data processing forms by the authorities.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too small, so he wants to continue to develop his program so that data can be transmitted only with the understanding of the person.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can not submit access to his data because the insurance is not concluded with him.
And thus the guards are left just like the G. of the winds.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both trade partners of each other, this was the main subject of other global problems in the nineteen-year-year-feeding.
Today, the French and Indian gipfel is also located, in particular discussing cooperation in the Atom Energy sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an exciting, democratic power, which should be given more votes and rights in international cases, however, the Member States could not be able to find whether they should submit the continuous membership of New Delhis in the United Nations Security Council, or not.
This question was not discussed at the nineteenth meeting of Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and Chair diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian President Manmohan Singh. There was an agreement which would be made to double trade within the next five years, such as approximately 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 was reduced from 25 to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this regard, the 26 existing civil flight agreements with India were legally composed of an agreement, so that the air traffic will be eventually endangered.
By 2009, India wants to submit the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to deal with the package.
The goal is to make a balance currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: the Union of the partners number one Indian is only in the area of nine of the EU partners.
The gipfel was determined by the global offer.
In addition, the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, regardless of terrorism, was condemned by both sides on the highest.
The Doha Round should also be completed with both sides of the sheet.
The EU emphasised its energy and climate programme, meaning that the damage emissions should be reduced by at least 20% until 2020.
In this context, India agreed, as well as the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise during the coming climate, and to reduce the gas production to 2050 to 50%.
The increase in prices in food should also be affected, thus both include a international conference on the issue of financial crisis.
The Indian Governing Boss visits the French capital today, where he will submit an agreement on the peaceful use of the atom energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is expected to be assigned to French companies in the value of EUR 20 billion for the building of atomic reactions in India.
Agency has to conclude the agreement at 15 years.

The small aircraft that was missing a year ago of the billion of Steve Fossett
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, who was missed on 3 September 2007 in a flight over the wilderness of Nevada, was found.
The parts were found on a 3000 m high platform, in the area of Serra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the countries of California and Nevada.
However, inside the aircraft there were no human survivors.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely strengthened the last doubts during a press conference: "The flight has been located, has been shot on a troop. Now we have the security that it is about the flight with which Steve Fossett fled on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human residues were found in the aircraft or its nearby.
The 63-year-old billion was dead in February.
The Ananian Security Office (Ntsb) noticed that a company has been checked a few hours after the aircraft has been seen, which identified the machine: it is the Bellanca 8kcab that was lost on 3 September 2007 after the start of a 3-hour flight in Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, some of the personal objects of Fossett from a couple near their home at the Mammoth Lakes were found in California, near the border of Nevada.
This is two exhibitions with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Propertyation of Illinois, bars and a Jacke.
The search for Fossett was given a month after his disappearance.
The billioner had obtained a place in the history through a long result of records.
In 2002, in the sixth attack, it was the first man to surround the worldball in a holiday ballon: a two-week, single flight.
Three years later, he enveloped the world in a single flight without interlanding with a flight.
Under his category records, a height flight of 15445 m over the other, however, with a co-pilot.
Glk, the public that you don't expect
A suv that falls through its original design and the special line management, the outloading surface and its clear angle from the original schema.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offerer to put a new spirit into the sector.
Just because of his exceptional properties, the imagination of Suv Glk will also appear unconventionally, which will be seen since 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
Thus, the public troops that will be associated with the appearance of the new model will also occur in a new clothing, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a newness in the car sector in the resting Italy.
A project with a maximum extent to be carried out in various phases, which will be taken by the Central Shopping Miles Maylands, to Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car, including 3D brillies that are distributed near the Corso Como will provide a special optical to the whole: the new suv will appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear as apparent from the place on which it is drawn.
This will be lightened in all its details, using the electricity8-technology of the new Glk at different times, to recombine it as a whole.
There is no doubt that Mercedes' offer with this publication is to introduce a new type of authoreclame in this earlier stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel to the interest of the future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium prohibition
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for which the whole Italy is sorrowing now? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling back since years of the Italian nationality and who, honestly, have caused no serious problems to be recently.
Never came to match with gender fans.
The Ursp of the Group is in the right environment.
The promotors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Triest and Udine.
To these, other smaller groups from campaigns and apoles were shot in Sofia.
They are the Tricolori, on which the towns of the Militarians appeared: but they were remote on Saturday to avoid exercising.
Your examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a match with a real right radical fans, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans 144 cards were provided for the game: all were issued on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: among those traveling to Sofia, there was no one with a running stadium prohibition.
Four fans of the Italian community, which had already been charged in this regard, were also rejected by the ticket and the travel to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of Bulgarian police to introduce further steps: in this case, the tifosi arrested or identified at the exhibitions can be calculated with a stadium prohibition of at least five years.
This is a international prohibition that prevents access to stages in Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is a number of post-building sites that could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be exposed immediately, and that such behavior in no case is given the possibility of justifying," it means from the viminal.
That's why, "It's especially with a choice on the nationality's game at the middle-week in Lecce."
Because in reality, there is a small nuclear of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sport Survey), on Tuesday, will gather the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, so the secret services that are occupied with the problem of the stadium dewalt.
"Duce-Duce call and the high-right arm during the hymne of Mameli? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazziová (deeply in no pleasure exhaust), which has been on the Viminal Director of Osservatorio since a few weeks (he took the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzi > was the President of the Police of Trieste, where now the Ultras Italian subsequents founded in 2002.
Although it is true, Mazzibody says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but, of course, the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – f ́ to add the number 1 of Osservatorio – crimes are in the land of their facts.
This group had to stay in the room until now, but now it must be overlooked what happened and it will happen.
But we also speak of the fifths during the Hymne Mamelis: even though this is not a punish, but they allow me, then the education fails...."
