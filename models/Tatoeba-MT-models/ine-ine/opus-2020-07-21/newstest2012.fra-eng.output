Parliament has not made the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament, within the framework of a amendment to criminal law, has made the draft cancellation of paragraph on the inculpation of Julia Tymosenko, the head of opposition.
In second read, the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the currently prisoned former Prime Minister.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years of prison for concluding an unnecessary agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not definitive and the Court must establish the call for the sentence in December.
Tymosenko approves the judgement of political vengeance of the regime and has caused a process of partiality suspects from the court to the western.
The draft draft of a > paragraph 365 of the criminal law, based on which the former Prime Minister was condemned, was signed by 147 members.
It would have needed 226 voices to approve it.
Libyan Victoria
Libyan freedom or rebellion has already fallen.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the wilderness and without it the war has been completed.
He's still determining the winners.
As it is coutum in the region, election winners are islamists, but if it is moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed Charia's usual law and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight we're cut off the hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the unrespectable of her faith are passive of the capital penalty...
This is the Coran who will join the dictator's personality of the company composed of opposed tribes.
Libya will rule such a order as we cannot represent it and as we would certainly not like.
But our way of life is not unique, not objectively the best and probably would not be beneficial for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that islamist guests have accepted help with confidential dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not a American general who managed the NATO's strips but instead of Allah whose size they would be elected to each attack.
So when it's looking for winners in Libya, the o's not part of it
We participated in the courses, served islam, and our policies turned away from the dictator as a political alliance without any benefit.
According to the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not care militaryly for Libya.
There is therefore no problem for locals to dismiss "cress".
It is that without the earth's occupation, oil companies will easily be accessed to the Libyan Black Gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the o's finally can benefit from a disinteressed protection of human rights.
Soon as we prevent these appeals from the charia.
A new crisis age begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the investors' viewer.
A turn of statistics went on Thursday on Europe.
Each of the states has made the information related to the PIB for 3A.
The Czech Economy has stepped this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The obligatory market struggle all records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The Offices of the Euro Zone Statistics, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have previously held their views of economic development for the third quarter.
The German PIB has a growth of 0.5%, the 0.4% of France.
The two countries had the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better placed (instead of 0.3% in place of 0.1%), however, France had been a decreased decrease of 0.1% (is a question of stagnation).
The Czech Economy has increased 1,5% during the third quarter.
However, the PIB has stepped and ­ The Czech Statistics Office is confirmed that the economic growth is a progressive decrease.
The results are worse than the analysis previsions.
The most important events:
Czech economy has increased 1,5% during the third trimester, but has continued during the last trimester.
In the third quarter, the German economy has increased 0.5% of the estimated and repealed data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union has increased between July and September in comparison to the quarter, which corresponds to the provisions of analyses.
The Greek economy has lost 5,2%.
The debt debt for ten years is 28.45%
The performances of Spain and Italy's obligations are striking to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Â ́s, etc.
Czech commitments are maintained below 4% while the situation is in the region.
Votes are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
Czechs have been qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrated the qualification for 200 million
The representation of the football has succeeded with its most difficult session mission!
In Montenegro, she also gained the super Cech and the guard Peter Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football also defends a great part of chance in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed reporting.
No special excitation during the first part and a large part of chance for the second.
The Czech representation also gained the super Cech and the hero Peter Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its qualification at European campionnat.
Montenegros were under pressure to the second part due to a precise Czech defence.
The victories of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who had two chances to mark a goal.
And thanks to the super Peter Cech, the Czech representation will not be abstained from Europe's campionship next year, and more than 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first minutes we played a football guer.
The two teams came hard to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers did not come to the Czech Defence, which directly responded to long courses even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are prepared for the nuclear programme in their country.
They created a human bottle
A few hundred students of high schools have created a human bottle around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country with a possibility of Israeli assault.
Students began to pray at midnight before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Spain have created a man's buckle around the Ishpahan nuclear center, where the ur is transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend the nuclear programme of their country to the danger of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) has found in its last information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear institutions.
Students began to pray at midnight before the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose goal would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Ispahan but also the site of Natanz where the ur is rich.
Food of a obsessed child: don't take a little dinner and take care for dinner
More than one third of the 9-13-year-old children have overweight problems, 9% of the schoolers have a weight above the average and 5% are obessed.
As the current research shows, obesity children come from families who have a bad life.
This shows again how important the environment in which human being and the models around it are.
On the obessed children's tables, for example, 50% of the characteristic is more often than in children's families at normal weight.
19% of the obesities had feeds at dinner, the request carried out with an action of "The Obesity is not a hazard"
In small sports familys is not also a habit, which is now the case of most of today's schoolers - only 15% answered that at least one time a week the parents took time for active movement.
Question of 900 Children
The question was deployed during the last school year and participated in 900 primary schools in Czechland.
It was the second edition of "The Obedience is not a hazard", supported by the General Health Assurance and the Unilever society.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 of the sixth to the third were inscribed to this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, even obesity, is the absent of a proper food and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the questioned children, for example, indicate to eat five times a day in the case of dinner - yesterday - dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," indicates one of the results of the question.
Without a little dinner and charcuttery at dinner
Specialists take attention to the fact that in order to have healthy development, there are some basic details such as a small dinner at the same time.
In Czechland, only 23% of the families eat at my same time.
In the major part of the family everyone takes his little dinner alone.
And the worst that was raised is that a tenth of the population doesn't take a little breakfast.
Yesterday, however, is based on good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obessed children more often consumes bad feeds.
Almost every → - without talking about weight - drinking sugar drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the questioned children are regularly sporting, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the query allowed children chosen (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare their own food from their proposed opportunities to go own and their personal opinion.
"The preferences of the Czech Children from 12 to 15 years are far from the idea."
Among their preferred plates there are many gates, meat and sugars.
"The most alarmant is, in particular, a great preference for sugar limonates," is indicated in the results of the question.
To dinner, these are the feet that took the first place right before the white meat.
Children do not want to be feculents and the preference for fish and food was very low.
Chief on Health
The request also showed that children are ready to change their habits since they receive ad hoc information.
"In the control of a group of participants at the questionnaire who had completed the questionnaire after the "Observation is not a hazard", it was seen to a well-determined will to go to a healthy food," they indicated the results of the request.
The most significant was, for example, regarding sugar limonates because children began to give preference to consumption water.
Children most often covered the white meat and fish as the main plat and reduced the sugar plates and the "knedliky" (speciality of cheques of bread-feed bullets or land pomps).
The list must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article regarding how to learn for the lists, I made a little wrath of the fact that there was a lot from the beginning.
I didn't think what would happen afterward.
The exhibitions of three professionals of the speciality, the accommodation of persons and a seminar on what is going on.
And it's gonna be worse.
We draw closer to final reviews and more expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Sunday and Sunday, it's actually "bourned".
This time we have with director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) treated the way to collect the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a little cow, the other a boy body, without a special corbe, another of the overweight.
The list must know how optically admining bread arms, extending a cow or raising the needed corbes.
So we have come to be nicely highlighting the personality and also not to be too seen by women types such as Jennifer Lopez with a strong poitrine and pronounced hanches and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and the hanches in such a way that jupes or pantalons do not pass in all, it is worth making it a measure.
And you won't regret it because the accumulation that falls impecc’s is inestimable.
In a jupe on a measure you will feel much better than in the one that slides permanently, rounds and doesn't keep on the cinture and soon.
For those who have a man's appearance, there may be an accommodation of Tucker, with cousy tissue songs, or even a lot of broadcastings.
There are evidently many examples of different appearances, and I am glad that I have all the week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid you should do what I have to do in the house there's too much.
Each stage has received a collection for day and evening.
We must take into account the present appearance, the type of personality and its appearance.
I should "habiller" Miranda Kerr, which you may know of the Victoria Secret campaign.
In the background of me, it makes me pleasure, because it's better than habiller Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost hundred kilograms of these last days (do not take my statement, svp, completely serious) or well the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and run from magazines or search on the Internet, print and work the graphism.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal and our relationship with graphical creation.
It is also important to think about the graphical part of the holding.
The list does not just imagine it, but grows the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for hand-saves, mantels, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, the graphist and graphist, took care of all of this.
But this... until Sunday
The list must have a general vision
Three of the speciality invited have given a variety of aspects on the Saturday meeting full of information on different types of persons.
Honza Pokorny,list, Jakub Polanka graphist of mode and Ben Renc, mode photograph.
Jacob reminded us that the mode is an illusion and the list should know to use it.
And a talentlist knows to work with a single accommodation in different ways.
Variability is for this primary example.
Like for example, this trench-coat that must be taken classically with a jean and a t-shirt like a mantel, but he can also shape the nudle body, with scarpins and take it into photo like a robe.
Or it's enough to rebow the bottles or the cow and have a new look immediately.
"Just with this" he highlighted.
But I especially appreciate the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to strike," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, while sometimes in mode magazines we see something else.
No statement on mode screening.
I know again, thanks to the mode photograph of Ben that the list must have much more variants of heating than those that are photographed.
It is to say that for fashion story that will have a diction of pages (so a say of models) I must be ready to "detail" at least a fifty.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely different than actually.
We must consider this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and the image sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna who is not a super song, but his image and marketing made it a world star.
In Czechland, the approach to the use of the list services remains fresh.
And faces with Property sometimes viewed them as unusual (you are enough to know something but what I seem to pass to the second range).
And if somebody makes a story from our side, then we have to count on the fact that he tells us with a great probability a totally different size (small) than that he has actually.
Then we are left to navigate on google and make sure if the information of bulevard is a state of the collectiveness concerned, if it has magri or big etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it doesn't suffice the list to orient in the mode and learn to gather models.
He must be with the people he has to be, and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing to be people, not flattering, keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his army and fill it again, you can't throw everything and say to him, "My God, what terrible."
"You'll find some cases you'll find beautiful and he you'll advise what to bring them," said Mario.
This showed us specifically what must contain all that is called "placovka" or sac of the list.
It's the one you're looking around the size and you've got on yourself for everything you need.
Further than the things defined in terms of ciss, depilation rolls, or even nutrition eggs, there are also the nilon sheet (which the list uses for photographing products such as sacks, or many caps), special clips with which a closure is closed in the bottom, if it is too large (the oil or other type of agrafy is not useful because they could cover the clothes) or even a couture kit.
To be not only people who listen, but who have tried something practically, they have taught us how to look like chaussures correctly.
And during the photo seat in the athleary where the surface is equal, the seed could be sealed, with strength to the outside.
And that's what we've done and done.
We didn't have the right to touch the tissues so that we could not hurt by unexpectedness.
So we really need competence.
Mario liked me when he welcomed me for my creation.
The account I'm doing is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second week-end of course
I'm also starting to understand that making a profession is not a promenade in a rose garden, that everyone tells what he wants.
The need for speed is disputed throughout America.
Revision
In the origin, a course without problem is transformed because of stupid errors of people who have nothing to do in a morning road move to work.
This fills everyone's ambition up to a certain measure but it doesn't serve anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled part of the theater has produced great expectations before the outcome.
He promised to take a new direction with the Need for Speed course series already age and to get out of a kind of game from playable parties that would not only count with points.
So we were interesting in how the passports will be replaced during which the main hero is out of his car and do what he wanted.
As this is already done in the NFS series, the result is fully different than what we expected.
These are potentially air course games but the enemy shoot down because of some unusual mistakes that already exist for several years.
This is not really a mistake but the expression of an incomprehensible fainance from the developers.
The aventure starts very well.
You are taken in the aventure of which the main hero Jack has characteristic problems and to resolve it starts to participate in illegal courses throughout America.
You are sitting behind the flight at the western coast in San Francisco and your mission is to reach the first to New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The inheritance is divided in ten steps and then in more than 50 courses.
What results that each course is on another roadway and the steps provided in different environments that are very different and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel the only instinct that the game offers him something of identity.
Some environments are very beautiful even if the graphical technical level is the same type of series.
Finally, this isn't the end of the world.
But the drive through the wilderness, in autumn landscapes or well in highly humid mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are more timely approved of an atypical election.
For example, in the wilderness you find in a sand storm that decreases your visibility in a senseless way.
Then in the mountains you need to take care of what a avalanch doesn't fall on you.
In addition to this, the different courses are well agencies each other behind the other.
There's only a small number, but it's enough.
There are instinctives that you are trying to overcome the number requested of opposers (as in a classic course) and then you'll run against the hour (classic dual with the chronometer) and then wait for another dual with a opposer.
At times you have also the police that enters the game and trys to make you the difficult situation.
Newness is the outer vehicle passages.
It is instead of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs before someone and you need to help it by pressing on the right button at the right time.
Nothing to be complicated.
What is surprising is that there are less times of this type than what you expect (to be specific only three).
The result is that because this element is not able to generate and place, in the context described above, in the elements that approve the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of games.
What means that there is no extraordinary thing currently but we cannot say that it is negative.
For the real simulation, you should go to another way.
But although we can find better in competition the model of conduct is very well with the type of design of courses.
So it's all right.
Problems begin to appear after a certain time.
In the difference of the model of conduct, it is still not the point.
We do not have this game a complex deformation and deformation, but when you do not have, when you have any object with any object, the latest idea of how your car behaves, it is not completely good.
During closed transmissions, you sometimes touch you mutually furiously but otherwise your car part in fools.
Or you're in the middle.
Thanks to the regeneration system, this is not really a problem but it really affects you.
The regeneration is so that when you've cut the figure or you've gone in the covering game you're running on the last point on the inner point.
But you have only five renames.
When you used the 5 renames, you must start the game again since the beginning.
So it's more a tool, for if something doesn't happen as it is necessary, that something you can really count on.
Sometimes remarks do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the tree of the tender.
The big gentleman of this game is that the same actions are located in the same places.
For example, there are some virages that must be passed in a certain way, else that doesn't happen.
Otherwise you meet on a given location of "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, five, five seconds in front or a minute in the late.
What makes anger these are the situations when you easily cross the opposite between two cars coming in inverse and when you arrive, you need to put on the side and conturb them or swimming them.
It is equal if you go before him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the situation given it always comes close to your nose.
Opponents have other benefits.
Pentate all the time of the game, you, you come to some places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opposite that leads you to the same place.
This is the most in the end of the game when you're rolling on a long pond in turn.
The opposer has to pass before you at any price.
When it goes before you, he hides you the view of other vehicles in turn and you enter a lot of times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something tragic and full of adredaline, but it's fair that you're quickly distressing.
And it's damage because through a simple conduct model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal to if it's because of the concept of 50 single travelers, that the order of courses is like there's no opportunity to renew or something else .
The original idea is the change of car during the courses.
You must take care of the basic pumps on the roads because you can change the most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are ideal for towns, the large American cylindrized for the right autoways and the super sport cars in exotic areas on very technical drives, for example on the lace roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are courses in particular places you know about the aventure, is very well with the main system of history.
You are not only receiving medals but also experience points to your profile that are common to challenges and futures.
When you reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to devote:
This connects online with the Autolog function that, inter alia, compares your results received with those of other players and provides other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult courses to understand is the situation of the last course of the aventure.
You are coming with your car in the metro tunnel, where you round in the darkness on the roads (sa ride).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priority) and behind you comes a metro tray that sends you the car directly to the railway.
In the editor, we had a discussion for a few days to know if someone really thought about the creation of this game or if the authors really take us for imbecil.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is in general pleasant and in some cases really super.
What is genuine is that in extreme situations, imagery does not keep the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially about accidents with a lot of participants when a fluid imagery does not serve you anymore.
The sound part is good and the track is at the choice.
In order to please the largest number, especially the young public, a new sound track has been created in the "I meet everything", but we can wait for nobody to buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: So it is really confused.
If the game hadn't had these stupid errors, we could not be afraid that it was the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game makes the impression of not to be finished.
Awesomeness is really good but you will prepare for the mistakes to put you in the eyes with the strength of a aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassadrice near the European Union:
Czech Republics are acting as negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between institutions"
"I wasn't attracted to such a hard war."
"There will be 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players live in their new role," thus Milene Vicenova started its exposure to the Czech Ambassadrice Faculty of Droit near the European Union.
When she succeeded to describe the various EU bodies and their relationships in a way so comprehensible and →, while a large number of conferences of the University of Droit of Charles's University could be able to winter, she showed how much she takes its "comprehensible and openly" motto about Europe.
Mrs. Vicenova has made the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, they reasoned the critics that he is hungry, that it is a round-cover, that he cannot fill any mission, and I have to say that he has cut the suffle to everyone because he holds his role to perfection."
"It's a man who can listen to 27 members, well with them and has a vision of the direction to take Europe."
It explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question, "Who is in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the unity and a greater readability of the Union policy against states, such as China or India.
No one wants to prohibit us our syrecky (cookie footage that feels very strong)
Mrs. Vicenova also stated the agenda that he had, lived and will live for a while close to the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency for two years ago.
Czechs resolved the financial crisis, gas crisis, or well organized a sum for a Eastern Part.
It qualified the loss of very negative government and harmed the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation to the EU is currently very occupied.
According to the words of Madam l'Ambassadrice, "the activity has completed not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved yet.
Moreover, it is necessary to approve the new seventh budget of the Union which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would be that the budget would be weak and for economics, which will have the priority, which countries will be helped at least in the framework of future negotiations.
Ms. Abassadrice reminded her slogans with which she came to Brussels "For a comprehensive Europe".
"I really don't love abreviations, foreign words, foreign ones that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that no one doesn't make round or tordus cornchons, bananas differently big or even nobody prohibited us to make syrecky."
She wants to use the EU environment better and see more Cheese in the European institutions.
A Europe at a number of speeds expects us
According to Abassadrice, the Czech Republic has the reputation of being eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspects more than positively.
Moreover, it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in European institutions.
The mistakes result in many factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their incapacity to write a letter of motivation and a low support of the Czech party.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, it then highlighted the force and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Cr" I, when the Polandian, the Magyar, the Slovakian, comes to me, "Hey, what are you doing there, what does this group of Visegrad still do?" and he is not content."
According to Madam Vicenova, in a nearby future, these are new hard rules on budgetary policy that are expected by Member States.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if it is not at several speeds, which prevents instead of a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and other outside the area."
"We have the Schengen space, we also have the Enhanced Cooperation Institute."
First, it was said that the countries who wanted it and those who did not want it were in their corner."
"There will be many institutions of this type and there will really be a Europe at two speeds," Mrs. Vicenova said.
In this regard, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases which all the subjects with an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not only members of the eurozone.
History of a mark:
The IBM innovator begins in the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expresses the IBM strategy at the nearest, the nearest would be "the long term".
For a wide public IBM is the symbol of the revolution, it is a firm feeling as a very present and yet since its creation he has grown hundred years.
The base of this long-term strategy was issued by the first head of the firm, Visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a lot of world problems can be resolved for a little time that people would want to think.
His "PENSE" slogan became the printing around which the life of a genuine future will be developed (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis for the culture of Watson's carefully developed company.
For us IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements to the future.
IBM survived hundred years because she remained faithful to its basic values and, however, was not afraid to change all the other around her.
This allowed us to transform the business, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will reach more for the birthday the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the thirty-years, began to take care of his employees as Bata in Czech Republic - the IBM people were the only one of the first American employees to have payable vacations, a assurance paid by the employer more a electant employment uniform and a well-build repository system for inventors and commercials.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed client relationship system.
The company was at the beginning in the covering of talents - such as one of the first firms that had any form of discrimination, and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the mind of the antidiscrimination strategy because it will be a Virginia Rometty woman - which should replace Palmisano with the IBM head.
This works at IBM for thirty years and currently occupies the head of Ventes, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years does what is called jamy, online storming brain from which are issued many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that he has many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500 000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
This is the internal and external image of the company which provides him a safe position in business areas.
"Despite the beginning of the IBM, there was a concept instead of institution than a firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economy at Harvard Economy School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve the world's problems by using it," was Geogre Colony of the Consulting Forrester Research firm.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the Great Bleue, as it is called the United States in respect of its slogan - she has grown up to become one of the largest world firms.
It is obviously the most polyvalent firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, housing, Council services at the level of products from the server until nano.
It has many patents from all American firms and five of its employees received a Nobel price.
Among its discoveries, for example, the distributor of billets, payment cards, financial swap, bar code or well the diskette.
IBM was found this year with 220 billion dollars the second largest firm of the market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it was the first time to overcome Microsoft in 1996.
Advanced preview
These are not all the innovations and manufactures that have had the customer and time preference - for example, IBM has not succeeded on a own operating system OS/2, the Prodig service online or the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the time your business is based on the movement you can't emotionally stay attracted on the past, "notice Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this reason, IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes.
In the difference, for example, of the Microsoft competitor, which stands and remains under the Windows operational system.
A Perspective
In the IBM income, services, which are formed for a fifth of software and hardware, have a positive place.
However, in 1990, it was more than the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM sold low rental assets for $15 billion, it invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspectives.
It continues in investments and even since 2008 when it for the first time exceeded the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiated the precepts of his first leader Thomas J. Watson, who also increased its investment volume during the large economic crisis.
Did IBM now seem to pass the current crisis without being concerned?
The price of the IBM action has progressed from 2008 in range of 120 per cent, and the net benefit of the firm continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible gentleman of other crises.
History of IBM: From fragrances to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it first had the complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name of IBM in 1924 - initially it was a mark used by a firm's succural in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the combination of four firms whose history is linked in the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
For example, the old "pointable", the pendules that recorded the array and the department of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who was president of the Society Supervisory Council until 1930.
Flint embauched the leader of a competitive firm Thomas J. Watson to help her lead the company.
The leader then made the shadow to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that still rest the identity and culture of the society.
Watson managed the campaign in 1952.
IBM, as he said his name, started with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - trancheuses of skin and meat to recording boxes.
During the first four years when Watson managed, the business number multiplied up to 9 million dollars and started the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was so unreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of direction, he was his son who occupied the leadership, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM started developing artificial intellectuality and developed the first programming language.
In the 60s, people and IBM computers helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturne, and on the Moon in 1969.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the time computer standard with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its manufacture of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of advice and services with high value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM in recent three years - is the concept of Smarter Planet "a more intelligent planet".
Its goal is the intellectual promotion of the Property in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and management of cities.
For the IBM trade area, there has been some time a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps commercials to manage the whole trade cycle.
IBM has a strong story also on our territory.
It created its contribution in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center of Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is sitting in Prague, and there is also the worldwide research and development team that takes care of the speech.
Richtarova concerning her faithful husband:
You can keep this egg, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it's done!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) became guardian of the body and loved Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina would still hope that Joseph was wakening from his rose dream and returning home.
Only she could not wait and set rules for the future life.
"Papa can come home, but not as my partner" explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in Bartosova in her house, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted for Ricany's delay after 30 days, Pepa didn't rest the song.
And he said in public he loved him.
With the time Darina resigned himself, accepted her husband's connection and ended by saying, "Aye forever."
Richtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband lies with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova are separated, there will be no wife to take her at the step of the door of the house.
"This is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put it out."
"He will no longer be my old old age, loving and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he left Rychtarova filtering by showing that she was distracted from her husband, but they are only in a decent relationship.
The fact Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and don't change."
"My wife put a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of reparations, garden, real estate, I buy."
"As Darina we are talking completely normal but we don't sleep in" said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't prevent him.
"We don't sleep in ` and he doesn't care for me to know where she goes, with who and if she has a connection.
I know that it's my fault, I've fallen in love with Iveta and I take all my responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Is this also about you?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, like the others, are able to get them out of their hands.
My dear ladies, you're going to know in the following lines of women's vices that come to burst the blood of men's vineyards.
Building
Your half notes that you are depending on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least a clothes per week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of sales?
In your case, we can talk about purchases like a →.
Some women think that they should restrict their passion to purchase.
But you say, who would resist the lake-vitrine of clothing stores, looking for himself of beautiful clothes and then trying them all in cabin (the different color idea)?
And although for most women buy is a hobby, this can become a real fire for man.
Remember just how many times you told your mate he's waiting for income...
Constant Insatisfaction
"I'm not too big?"
"I'd have to meat at least 5 pounds - I should start doing sport?"
"I'm sorry?"
Didn't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yeah?
So you are part of these women who are obsessed by their appearance.
This is not the question you should stop dealing with yourself, but a large number of men is allergic because their partner is still in dealing with his appearance.
The strong sex does not say that the frequency of these claims increases and women become more empoisoning.
Wood and cleanness at first
It's like a finish manage.
Take windows, pass the aspirator, clean the sun, make the powder, break the bathroom - and it two times a week.
Do you notice your partner that he walks with salted feet on the ground, children they went out the lavabo, crossed the vitro of the living room, and that gives you much work?
If you are just suffering from this situation, try to have the mind that you do not have to exage and that the order and cleanness should not be at the first place in the family.
However, this undeserved desire of cleanness can break your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sadness
"But this surrounding used for the pub."
"You're going to put these old chaussettes tomorrow?"
"A mocked snippet has nothing to do on earth."
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really decompose it.
It's obvious that you don't think bad you want everything to be inequable.
Maybe if men do it, women wouldn't have to do so much sad work...
Diffusion, persiflage
Diffusion, persuasion, but also insults against someone are also the own of certain women.
Women are particularly concerned with relations and thus are pleased to treat subjects such as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe everyone of us let us escape a little inoffensive persuasion here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persevere, even disappoint others, and they are especially in the work in a collection of women - especially dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek have helped by participating in Philadelowe Victory
The hokeyist attacker Jagr participated twice in Philadelowe winning during the Sunday NHL match on Caroline ice and is again in the head of productive Czech players for concours.
From the point of view of the 39-anns Giroux star, who has yet made a more pass and was appointed the best player of the match, he marked in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, playing with Jagr, also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match declared to the outer Atlantic journalists that he had predicted Giroux that it would be a great night.
"I told him before the match he would give his ha-trick."
"I heard it."
"Every time this feeling falls upon you" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marks a purpose for the first time of the Flyers.
An instinct later was a second assault of the Czech team.
Voracek fighted behind the Urricans' goals for the palette and presented it to the Maxime Talbot butter.
One second before the first pause, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a decent, but the beginning of the second part belongs to Flyers.
Specificly in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he marked three targets, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player of the ligue but he's actually part of the three best," Jagr said about his center.
"I've never thought I'd play at the end of a career with a hokeychit like him."
"I'm really pleased with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in NHL the other players of the team have tried to play on me, now it's my tour," said Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and Dwyer again on a penalty threshold she ends with a diffusion of a goal.
Matt Read did not separate other complications that ended at two against one.
"Pronger has done excellent attacks in our area."
"He's thrown on the palette, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most remote angle of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I reached it," described the last goal of the match of its Voracek viewpoint.
Philadelowe has arrived with this victory in the East Conference.
The Czech Defensor of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not end the match with Buffalo, he went out in second third place because of a wound in the top part of the body.
The Candians did not face a experimental defendant who lost their front of two butset after a penalty threshold by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the back line was sick that was especially injured by the local entryer instead of lost points because they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's new."
"We played the match only with a experimental player, the rest was young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," said Jacques Martin.
"The replacement was not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just planned to simplify the game, move the palette out of our area."
For this reason, we had limited, "the one of P. K. Subban defenders.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defendant, participated in the thirteenth Winnipeg attack and the victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different trainers participated in uax targets of Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have developed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travels in particular in the countries of the socialist block, because the travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for vacations in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the two in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A large exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when it was authorised to travel to Yugoslavia, then the regime began to have a inclination to the west and the travel to Yugoslavia was very limited to the Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist time was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist block (as so for the Czech Slovaks) to travel individually even in the socialist countries.
In the case where the Czechoslovakian wanted to travel individually to Poland or Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter other than the individual travel was not allowed.
The travel agencies at that time also offered travels to the West, however, it was necessary to make the cheue all night with a couching bag or having a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it wasn't won't yet.
The agreement for devises that were the condition of traveling to the west was made to people "politically wrong" which could not be able to travel.
However, the Checoslovake currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible for financial means without the agreement of devises (West Monday) to travel to West.
The Czechs often passed their holidays in the country where there were many campaigns and chalets houses that the Czechs purchased and this hard habit until now.
Czech travels have since 1989 known a big revolution.
Although the vacances in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum until 1989, the Czech Republic spent the last year to the foreign 4 million holidays in the countries of the world.
The great paradox that we have not known today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go free to 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of the time.
The elimination of visions in the 1990s of the last century in the neighborhood countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria, in Vienna and Germany.
The Czech Slovaks can't long travel through aeroplane to the western that everyone wanted to see at least one instinct.
For example, in Paris, the travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical travel of a Cheese travel was at that time to carry his own food, saucisson, etc. to economise.
Another important instinct was also the interchangeability of the Czech Corn that finally allowed our tourists to buy freely from the West currency.
Our level of life and the average salary increased what has caused around 1997 another important time.
Thanks to a growing request for traveling, travel agencies began since 1997 to prepare tours with air cartridges which, through contracts, reduced the costs in comparison with what was before.
At the end of the 1990s of the last century, the Czechs had an unvisual link with practically most of the developed countries in the world, other than the EU, which later made our travels easier.
Another time interesting in the history of the post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to a exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, each year, the direct air cartridges have carried out Czech tourists in the far-term countries; this winter will have 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
There are more than 100000 Czechs who visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting time in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutional development has occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU removed the visibility for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to be completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, the Czech Republic also spent for the first time in the history more than half of their holidays in the foreign (50,3%) and for the first time in the history, more than 15,000 hours per person for vacations in the foreign, including the charges of the added.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this is the risk of ending with a situation without solution to "a pat"
Nearly five months the Czech football is without President, and the follower of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is still not known after a General Assembly to take place Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement with which vote regulation should be processed.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas
Hasek gave his demission in June, and during his department, he called his members together and found a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.
Only during the year after Hasek the football returned to divergences between the Association rooms that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely shown on 16 September when a new President had to choose.
The delegates of the General Assembly were unusually gathered in the National Assembly in Prague because the negotiation remained locked and had not even been questioned to deal with the way to escape.
There was no agreement on the fact of knowing who has the right to vote to the General Assembly - is it only the statutory representatives or also the employees of full powers.
In this unique point, there was a party agreement since this instant with the assistance of the Office for State and Right, which is not possible on the basis of the full power.
Divergences continue on the election regulation.
It is too much that the Executive Committee, which, in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not contributed to the situation.
The opinions on the possibility of vote have changed several times, but the neurological point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third turn to not fall in the bed.
"The divorce pomp is in the following case: whether to process statues or to find another model," said one of the three presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, who represents the professional football within the district.
According to the rules of the scheduled model, the third turn of the candidates will receive the most percent vote in the room for which he is candidate.
Moravia is ready to return to the candidate who will receive the largest percentage of votes from the two rooms.
And the Czech part studies the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percent of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two tours and it would make the bicameral concept complete," admits Svoboda, which includes the objections of the live party and which would be the best to not change the regulation and vote in force.
It is surprising that Tomas ։ It is also agreed even if it believes that the election regulation is established of the most favourable statutes of Pelta among all candidates.
"I want to vote at the maximum of the statutes of the §."
"When there are no saved ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is the first candidate and who in his exposures has been defined in particular against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, there will be a new President in Nymburk, and he believes that candidates will cooperate in the future in a constructive manner.
"The potential qualification in Championnat of Europe today should be calm to everyone."
"The football will be again on a happiness vague and there will be more income for a cooperation" means Jablonec's officer who among the three has the largest experience in the direction of the football both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimist.
"I believe in this agreement but, despite all, the situation is very tired."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are tends to want to change the design regulations."
"This may cause a blocking again to the General Assembly."
"I hope the same reason I'm going to win," Rajchl said.
There is no longer time for a common agreement to all parties.
Certain meetings should be held directly in Montenegro, but who can say if the whole direction of the football will be complete for the match.
The flight especially disappointed in which it was to travel to Podgorice between the Presidents of Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, was not discovered for technical reasons and were searched for a variant to take a part of the exempting committee on the area of the represails.
Finally, it is the Ministerial Meeting, which might be held on Thursday, which should be determining.
The Ministry of Education for Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties delayed within the highest sports → and to bring them into an agreement.
In the game there are many: a statistical dotation, football credibility and also the Czech Sports General Assembly, which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
It's going to fight for the Chairman's position because he does not see any correct candidate.
If the leader of the footballers of Plzen Tomas ́lik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered everything he requested for a new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) would not be campaigned for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists, I support it, I fight for him and I don't present me to the election."
"In the present situation, it was not possible to find such a candidate," said the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
The motivation of ↑lik is to enter into competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the AFRT head, which would first be given favor for this choice.
It also highlights that in the case of the elections, it would hold the Chairman's position only until 2013 for a General Assembly.
He would see a experimental and high-level manager in the function but is not connected to the football world.
"I discussed with people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some said that they wouldn't be identified with the Czech football at this time."
"I'd like to change this picture," he said.
What, especially, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man who is known in the coulisses as lobbyists who are able to influence the vote of the delegates of the General Assembly.
It is not acceptable for Pelta to take this position of the President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing again in the football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high flight marketer, it would be even less favorable to football," she declared.
What the choice still is that the name of Pelta has been announced a few years ago in the context of an investigation on a case of corruption, for which Pelta has come out without any damage.
"I don't know what pretty Pelta would bring to football."
"And how we should be considered in the eyes of the EUFA and the FIFA'diteltlik, who said "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club."
In the case where the vote would be triomphed on Thursday, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who was supported by itself before the General Assembly of September, who had ended by a fiasco, thinks of the same thing.
"It (Pelta) would be the first I'd be with."
"It's great capacity"
"He could, for example, be able to present himself as a head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put the nose in what I don't know," Indian, who in September took great attention when he spoke for the cancellation of the Commission of Arts with Ludek Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
It states that it would be at the level of management of the Association.
He takes as example his ability to lead private firms and also leads the Plzen Club since the last year, who celebrated with its support in May in the first division.
"I have the power to make something change in the sport world and bring a certain culture there."
"I would free the influence of some interested groups who, for example, have tend to influence the disciplinary and calling Commission, which has caused bad go's situations," said êéquellik who does not hide his antipathie for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympical Committee whose lobby power in high-level policies would allow more sports of the tax on games.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take care of."
"If this is the tax on hazard games as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money is going," he said.
It does not take its current connection with the Plzen Club as a negative thing even if it himself states that the President of the AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is linked again with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"This isn't the idea."
I don't see why to translate my actions from the Plzen Club to someone if I have to return a year and a half after, "say.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end the situations of bed.
Two days before the Football Association General Assembly, one of the candidates to President Miroslav Pelta promised that if it was chosen, the AFRT will have new statutes to end in the future on the election regulation.
The officer of Jablonec is very optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk and thinks that the success of the football representation today should be calm before the vote.
It has been promised before the election of September that has not been done, that it has just promised to be dedicated to the national representation and to the receipt of financial means if it is chosen.
He decided to be candidate at the last time before the past General Assembly, and this duration of two months could help him to defend his vision of the direction of the football and to present it in a broad context.
"The people at all levels have been footballed for a long time and have been waiting for Thursday there's a President."
"They feel that it's the best time for someone to take the Association's direction," he says, "but it's primarily linked to the Jablonec Club, worked a lot of years in Sparta and the EU's Excipient Committee.
This is also why it has enough experiences to lead the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election, there is an euphory that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Happy to the General Assembly of the Statutes of June were approved that were not perfect as all of them were considered."
"If there were no such different interpretations, we would have already had a President since September," Mr Pelta.
This is just the most important review of the document of civilians who took all attention to the delegates.
"If I become the President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take all responsibilities in the case that it does not work."
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," said Pelta.
Then he strives to not confront his opposers.
He previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his right training and that he perseveredly knew that his opposite would be his first Vice-President.
He has no longer attacked Tonasquellik who, in contrast, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He has been developed in the football for a year and has already been successful."
"Their attacks were, however, not most honourable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to the address of his opposite but stay, he said, faithful to the announcements he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to national representation.
It should be a football wheat.
"And I would also strive to finish all cases that begin with the Bohemians or the success of the corruption scandale."
"I would immediately enter negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could have enough money for all football," the Czech Press Agency said the 46th candidate for two months ago.
He also said that his nomination to the head of the football would not make any changes of people.
"I should come to know all employees," he said to Strahov where it rules a comprehensive nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophe scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of discourse on how to vote at the third round, we will overcome it."
"The football needs creditability and it will only get it when there's a new leader at his head," as it says in a optimistic way of Pelta two days before the probably determining day for his officer's career.
Rajchl promises that the AFRT would start working hard under its direction.
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is chosen a new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly of Thursday, it would not like a lot of people.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the case he would choose, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee are responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to regulate the Bohemian case, to improve relations with EUFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and to continue the work started by pre-decedent Ivan Hasek.
"As the President, I want to take care of the football in all of her."
"International contacts with the EUFA and the FIFA through the national representation, professional football and a perfect football for youth."
"But I don't say I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in a CTK maintenance.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute competences within the Excipient Committee so that each member may take care of a specific area."
"And I'll distribute difficult missions to make football a big step in front."
"Some people will not be satisfied because it will start working hard instead of criticizing others."
He stated that he would not be a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it, and if I'll have people behind me who will put me in the wheels and put doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he was deceived.
"Some people said to me that I don't have to reject because they would also reject."
"It's a confidence I can't trace," he said.
What motivates is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"From these last two years there was a great real work and I don't want to let it fall."
"There are processes that have been held that will have consequences in some years and I would not like anyone to stop them." He said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election, the situation in the Union does not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work, and this is something Mirek Pelta doesn't know."
"There are people who would do football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been chosen."
"We can reproach me a number of things but certainly not support anybody."
"I'm trying to be a goal."
"I want to do football for everyone, because everyone will be pleased with it not only those who have been chosen
And again he confirms that he would be only a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there's anyone who says the contrary, I'm ready to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts by one Czech and the other morave whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would not have any situation as currently with only three moral teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas ։lik, President of the Plzen Club, has entered into the competition for the Chairman's post, Rajchl cannot evaluate its own chances of winning.
"I feel permanently supported by the Czech Chamber who chose me his Vice-President and knows that with me there will be success," Rajchl considered among his future successes to economy tens of millions of coronations on disadvantaged contracts, negotiations with television and games.
In contrast, he said that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "which is disqualified because the Czech footblal with him would lose his credibility," he thinks that the second opponent is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"Nobody can doubt Plzen that he has done a great work this year."
"If he was chosen, he would certainly continue in what Hasek started and would not make significant changes among people in the Commission."
"He wouldn't want to get out of his success," Rajchl said who evaluated his own.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A shot in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Pat's oven's optical, wonderful pools of Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or making a long hole - can let his feet rest in gasing water bags.
A book shows in which bassin of nature we can experience most well-being.
When Iris Meder was traveling for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not miss in his baggage: his bathroom maillot.
When she was stretched on her legs in the water, she observed the articulately arranged cups, and naked against Putten's marbles that attracted it from the other side of the piscine and missed to add the New Art metically restored of these converted piss.
If a covered pool would make her pleasure, she would note in her book without time all the valuable details of the type of building and the story of the building.
More than 200 pools were considered in this way by the architecture history of Meder, and it presented them in her book already described: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The municipal pools covered by Münich, the historical bain palaces in the black forest, "Beton Hardcore buildings" in the Taunus.
She conducted its "separators to the most exceptional bathrooms in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Near Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited its sites in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
Germany of 46 years is a real fervent of the bain culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport but she feels attached to water in a totally different way.
It is irritant that the supporters of the natation must enjoy contemptation of blue carriers and accommodate Javel's water pool while players breathe the perfume sending epicea forests or can listen to the gas of joyful birds of the park.
"I asked me one day why the pools must always be as soon as you leave," said the winois.
"I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The water surface double strengthens architecture
A pool in a pool and oil of sauna oil - the factor of goodness in the natation rooms is great because all senses are wake up, according to Meder.
And if the baptizers were given a little more painful, the narrow rooms could be a real delicate for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, we have a surface of water in the natation rooms."
"It's on a transparent side, but reflects the beautifulness of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high voeues, multicolor carriers, tremplins.
The image volume of small "Badefreuden" format makes a valuable report of 190 pages of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical welfare - he certainly wants to make a shot in the blue.
The Collectionsman Meder discovered notable examples during her research in Hungary.
Near the well-being bags like the 100-year-old Shechenyi Bain in Budapest, she found waters containing nitrate in a natural caverne in the karst (cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a bathroom of therms whose bassins are filled with water containing alcali and (Városi Termalfürdö in Jaszberenny) and found in a bathroom.
Instead, the pools of the full air of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a toilet of Zürich's bathroom we have all the city in his eyes, we can add the Arlberg inclined from a foreign pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bain is combined with a window from which we can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design of pool is expecting nagers in Längenfeld: The Water Dome Ötztal resorts to a OVNI that just came on the Alpes.
In winter, the winter is from the three open plates, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal go to heaven.
Alhambra in black forest
Javel's water wheel doesn't take all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermical baths have a suffrage, from the Arrd-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba, which is hard to believe, to find in a health spa.
The odor comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its limon brings you to the skin after you let you go into the pool - a special spa experience.
Her search for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also found deceptions: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free and full air of Checoslovakia, she was found before a barricad land.
The bathroom designed by the Dušan Jurkovic archive was closed in 1902.
When she looked ahead through the window of the New Art In Red-Blu-June, she observed the spread of the bad herbs between the carriers.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's therm palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it is not only possible to discover nio-romain elements that come from its conception in 1844, but still a worry room in Alhambra, which was given to him in 1900.
Since 1995's careful modernization, the thermal palace remains the favorite bain of the basin expert Iris Meder - and not only because it is originating from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a beautiful performance that is to make building so different in such a wonderful unit," Meder said.
With such a palace, the flat in the thermal basin is apparently only a small question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the specification on primary matters
De Christian Teevs
Does the German bank leave its speculation on the first materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Joseph Ackermann loaded a working group to search for the consequences of speculation for the poor people of the world.
In January, the leader of the group wants to take the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the matter is: According to a study, 84 per cent of Germans are unacceptable that the banks specify the primary materials such as magic and vegetable.
Two thirds of the requested persons even require that the German bank and other credit institutions dismiss this income of business because it increases the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is supported by a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the Bourses on the global primary materials, moves the prices up and the banks share a complication in world famine.
The consumer protection campaign is particularly aligned against the leader of the Deutsche-Bank, Joseph Ackermann, even if the large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
The speculation on primary materials was initially introduced to protect goods from price fluctuation.
However, most experts share the opinion that the parents have distracted their offers and ask - and benefit from the expenditure of the very poor.
Ackermann responded differently to the American competitors: He promised to investigate the prosecution and said, "No matter is worth playing the right reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group currently examines Foodwatch-Reports.
The examen must be completed from here at the end of the year, and then the results of the Governing Council of the Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, of habit.
End of January, the Chief of the Bank will indicate the consequences to take place.
It could result in a reduction in the market of primary materials, or even a complete abandon.
Ackermann built his Image
The leader of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the new, but at the same time confirmed its criticisms towards the financial sector: "The speculation on the growth of food prices shows a particular draconic way, as today's banks hurt the general interest."
Ackermann is the first lobby to be particularly binding today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all positions from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculations", said the Bode.
"This is little, for Mr. Ackermann, whether there is a question of famine or if the German Bank's reputation is in play."
Ackermann's conscience may appear in the first surprising view, but the group's PDG wants to present a perfect image, a few months before it leaves its functions.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Administrative Council will not change anything to what is provided within the Administrative Council.
It could improve its mark image with a delay of converse agricultural speculations.
And in the case of eventual losses, he is not wise to be concerned about it - his follower will take care of it.
One of the two would resist the positions on the main materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
More than 30 000 international people have already participated in the organization's campaign.
The Bode conducted the Mardi survey, with which the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November made questionnaires with 1001 people.
Only eleven percent found that the Deutsche Bank offers places for which food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one of two would, after the investigation, resist all the positions for which money is injected in the specifications on primary materials.
43 percent would be discontinued by such a bank on their round, 49 per cent replied that they would reflect on the resiliation of their account to change the institution.
21th house in Vienna
The Pavillon who delayed
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with higher, lower, and Happy End: the Austrian pavillon for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 received prices, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell in ruin.
Now it is open again and holds place of exhibition.
If it is enthusiasm for a modern post-government, for its forms, its hungars in glass, its live and audacious longs and its new building materials that are typical of the faith in the technical progress, then the architect of the Austrian Karl Swanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and glorious example.
The Pavillon of Schwanzer received the "Grande Architecture Price" for its ice and glass construction, and suspended.
Construction is considered to be a major step in the modern architecture.
He made the texts so famous, that he also built the Pavillon for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
Although his four-country house with BMW cylindres and its adjacent building in Munich, he finally became glorious at the international level in 1973.
His project of pavillon as a temporary building has been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Switzerland Garden in the south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was not either technically adapted to a museum - no walls to cross the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was so long used until the modern art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the bathing was empty and was far more delayed.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavillon, now he has the name of "Maison of the 21th century" and will be used in the future as a museum for the modern art.
Thursday evening the Belveder Museum opened, whereas the house belongs, the first exhibition is a chance for all views.
Agnès Husslein-Arco, which became the new guide in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belveder, was conducted by Agnès Husslein-Arco.
Husslein-Arco, promoted a historic of art to a significant career among others in its youth of artistic panic, after Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a foundation of the modern art Museum of Salzbourg, it was particularly well-handed with the political men and the protection of monuments, which has received public funds and private sponsoring and has established the operation.
Except the contemporary art, the works of Fritz Wotruba sculptor whose foundation is the same name has been exposed there, a café and a library are located there, and a office must be built there.
strict monitoring, small budget
For Krischanitz's implementation, then, was the ideal interface.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded the sequence of Joseph Olbracht and had won the concours, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that the pavilion for him was "a very important place" where he had seen the exhibitions " practically every weekend".
He knew the original project, and he knew the issues of the building, which lost generosity and eroticity after its movement to Vienna and its change of use.
In the present transformation, there are big problems: the building was "a energy-group", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glass fashions were changed, the isolant glass strengthened in glass fibres was placed and the toilet was replaced by a special safe glass.
The pots of the thermical ponts have been strengthened or replaced, and the clothes filled with amiant were rehabilitated.
Two sub-sols have made the place to the new exploitation, a tamazed light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a pond leading to the entrance - it is almost a new building, but always holding Pavillon Schwanzer.
The outer doors of origins have remained, the house is painted in a dark protection against the red-brun red wheel.
And the cinema room is even exactly identical to what it was sometimes.
And all of this under close monitoring of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"There are materials that are good and less dear to be found, and they also enjoy the Office of Protection of monuments," Krischanitz said, and he attaches attention to a brutal ground in subsol.
Despite all restrictions, problems and transformations, the building remained flat and slow.
It would have been difficult with Pavillon, "which came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such a technology is "always in the wrong place" and wants to "wake up the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21th century is not in the wrong place, because if this is a town building moment: around the Gardin Switzerland is just the "fourth of the central garage" of all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may occur: The Business of the 21th century could benefit from the strength of another Krischanitz building, because the Francesca von Habsburg Collection has bought the Berlinish Temporary Art Centre, and, as he says, it is already negotiating with the city to › a site in the neighborhood of the Switzerland Garden.
She plans a standard winter crisis in millions.
The railway society has developed a crisis plan that aims to avoid winter train accidents.
The number of salaries should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to winter season and losses, the "Deutsche Bahn" railway company will cost more than 70 million additional this year.
The "image"-Zeitung day reported to the preliminary by invoking a internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of approximately 300 million euro would be planned until 2015.
This should also enable the improvement of vehicles and railway networks in extreme time.
The number of internal and external salaries for the refraining of railway facilities and which should be doubled and passed to 16,000 people.
The goal is to remove which snow and ice until the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the road devices necessary for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube held the Government and industry during a conference to the summit of train accidents that also occurred in this winter.
The last winter of the railways society has experienced extreme problems for the transport of users because it is missing of reservations in case of difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been allowed by the Iron Road Ministry for years.
Moreover, there is a delay in the ICE train delivery.
The railway company has been working for years, since it has to make the ICE trains checks quite more frequently at the atelier, after a breakdown of ovals has occurred on a ICE in the central garage of Colonia.
The German "Deutsche Bank" bank pays millions of penalties to the United States.
In the case of Chief Joseph Ackermann, there is new in the United States: the German "Deutsche Bank" bank must pay an amend to millions.
As if the Deutsche Bank's problems had no longer been sufficient, the past of this sector's rattrape in addition to the United States: the Francfort Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to resolve a difference due to the failure of five large co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothec documents.
The NCUA financial market regulator has a series of accusations to the major banks, and it would have encouraged the co-operative banks to make false promises on the purchasing of financial products; they would have minimised the risks.
These documents have lost very valuable during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are satisfied, that we could have found a solution to this, without the parties to start a procedure in the court," said an interlocutor of the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank has not recognised any error in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of the NCUA Debbie Matz accepted the consents of the two agencies.
The National Credit Union Propertyation (CUA) responsible for the United States Cooperative Banks and interacts in case of failure to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to repair the damage of several billion dollars.
The currently concluded comparisons are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks in part and was assigned to the Court of Justice JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The question of hypothetic documents is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit houses are based on it.
When the American immobiliary bottle was expanded in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of companies.
In September 2008, at the summary of the financial crisis, the United States Investment Bank Lehman Brothers grew up.
Even if the events have been given for a few years, it currently suffles an wind of storm on the American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have intended to have many resources for repair or sanction of deficiencies.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has deployed the largest state of complaints.
It recalls 18 large international banks, both of the American State Immobiliary Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be prejudiced in nature in cases of hypotheches of about 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank must also submit a resource to the FHFA, which is a number of operations of a total of $14.2 billion for 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurter respond to "substantial duties" but, however, without quoting a specific sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the requests as injustified and said that it would be defenced.
WARREN Buffett increases 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the Government of Finance, invests colossal amounts in the IBM TI.
Since March, he bought action for a value of over 10 billion dollars.
Until then, the large American investor Warren Buffett explains not to invest in TI information companies, since the long-term development of companies is only a bad pronostic.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed its opinion on investments in this sector.
It had already been to understand much earlier than the IBM offers services and information systems for TI sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered as an attack on horse in the financial world.
Therefore, the TI IBM activity is granted the right to be called "Mister IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed the CNBC economic emission, which has bought from March IBM action of $10.7 billion.
His investment company Berkshire Hathaway became a large IBM shareholder with a part of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that IBM never knew anything about this commitment until here.
He welcomed the direction, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You've done a super job," Buffett strategicly said.
IBM has been put for a while on TI's lucrative services as "building of accounting centres.
The informal pioneer, older than 100 years old, also offers software and consultation as well as very perfect business calculators.
Buffett had soon avoided businesses.
He says that he is only investing in the enterprises which he understands businesses.
But in contrast, Buffett attacks railway fresh, rubber manufacturers or machines.
The Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 branches and parts in a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the ex Re-Munichois.
This eighth-year-old anniversary had re-repeated in the 1960s the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and had led it to one of the most prestigious world companies through smart investments.
However, his life’s life is modesty.
That is why it is a form of worship for many investors in the world.
His feeling almost unfailable to win money worth the surname of "Oracle d'Omaha".
After Buffett's investment announcement, IBM actions increased by one percent to the bourgeois.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a total value of more than 220 billion dollars and account with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to participate in it.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is ill.
After the "Zwickauer Cell" covering, the Turkish media doubt about the German rights status.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blood ideology" that would renew now.
Eight Turkish citizens and a small Greek company in 2000 to 2006 had an extreme context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German and Turkish population react with fear and concern.
Because for many German-Turks, the spectrum that we have been dead has been dead for a long time repeated its appearance: since Mõn's incendiary expectations in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there was no more violence comparable to this extreme context of right against the Turks.
The fact that there is a xenophobie in Germany, however, it has never been questioned.
The extreme right network that has been detected, however, shows the proportions of which the dimension is far off to be pre-predicted.
"Is there a return to blood idea?" "This was the title of the transmission on the Internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah highlights that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and concerns the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right bower.
That is reasonably that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: she called this weekend to a silent memory of racial violence victims before the Brandebourg gate.
It is only two weeks ago that the Turkish community of Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had considered a ceremonie of the fifth anniversary of the German and Turkish recruitment agreement.
It is with gay colors that the cohabitation has been set in scene, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a giffle: "The gift of Germany for the fifth anniversary" is the title of a article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus, the German parution of "Hürriyet" does not have the right to carry out unilateral conditions.
"it starts to be a child," Tel is the title of the Chronic of Ahmet Külahci.
It highlights that people would have been able to pay taxes and would have contributed significantly to the restructuring of Germany by their work.
The police action was considered very critically on the German-Turks forums, and these had been discussed with the success of their research.
Why it hasn't already come to the mind of the German authorities to investigate in some areas of suspicious extremely straight, the authors are surprised.
More than one seems ready at least to rather than drastic means: "If the case continues to be bacled, the migrants will remain nothing other than self-defense and armment."
"it's gonna be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of information and pertinence of the punishment of the network," wrote "Selen".
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, Mõn and Solingen's attents were well explained in the 1990s.
The photo of ruins after the incendie of Solingen is deeply incredible in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has been shown more to Turks living here than a tangible threat, and the Germans, on which the defiance and distantness of violence acts to delay.
However, the attents have appealed to the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past errors
It is especially the failure of the German policy after the attents of the Turkish presses: Helmut Kohl has made visit to the overseers of Mõn.
After the Incendie of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, he represented the funerals in Cologne by his Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel accounted at the time in his speech, how many taxes was produced by the local Turkish population.
As if a man's value could be evaluated on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows how much more the defiance of many Germany-Turks has been deep towards local law state since that date.
In addition to the efforts to enhance the lighting and reevaluation of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, it is this time necessary.
The Zürich Lake Scandal Bank
The most advensive European Bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and suffers during the time of a crisis to the other.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber imagined.
After its spectacular department of the Bundesbank's head; in July, it was known that it would take a nearly as spectacular post in 2013: President of the Board of Administration of the Great Swiss Bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber rejoiced, he welcomed; Switzerland for its beautifulness and UBS for its recently obtained solidity and has made famous observations on the future.
"UBS succeeded Turnaround."
"I enjoy the ability with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
Yet, since September, he was able to change everything.
A UBS Title market in London had distorted all the Bank's security systems and had flambed about 1,7 billion euros.
The Chief of the UBS Administrative Council of Oswald Grübel, a well-known bank not only in Switzerland, had to go.
the President of the UBS Administrative Council has been considered as a suspicious - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will repeat the Presidency of the Administration in May - not in 2013, as the bank was on Monday.
For Axel Weber, this becomes difficult.
It is not a ban, much more economy professor and the President of the bank, and it would certainly have needed an adjustment period.
Once again, he was responsible for a bank's strategy, which has just proved more than it has deserved the title of the "the largest scandale bank of Europe" for a long time.
In fact, the UBS is on one large side - until recently, she was the biggest manager of assets in the world, and, on the other hand, she suffered for years from a scandale to another.
Nothing, if he does, doesn't spare the Swiss wrath bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The picture of the Swiss activity manager, silent and solid, but also rushed, has combined it with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of investment.
So UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1,6 billion more money from a easy customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had progressed as a investment bank in the ligue of the largest banks of the world.
That's the impression.
Ancient ban · Hans Geiger and later a bank teacher for long years in Zurich ra: "I've always taken the UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"In the current optical, we ask ourselves, how would I just have been able to get in this point?"
He was deeply foolish.
In 2007, it appeared that something did not turn around the UBS for the first time.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli returned in a surprising manner, which was considered to be a high intellectual and a genial ban.
A few months later, we pressured for what reasons he had gone.
The bank's division was flambed with sub-prime documents and has a cross on billions.
The UBS announced an increase in capital of a amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross above.
It has actually found investors, but sometimes before, they would have cut down the sugars: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an arabic state fund, which had passed in silence, while they had never learned its name.
However, it was only the first time.
On April 2008, it came to pass.
The bank had to announce the losses of billion, and the President of the Board of Administration of Marcel Ospel, which was still the second administration Council of Switzerland, would return in 2006.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: the UBS was found, given its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the failure and was required to be saved by the State.
The National Bank has purchased the UBS of tens of billion problems, and the Swedish Conference has given six billion francs for obligations convertible to action, for which it could be co-private of the bank.
All Switzerland has been cut - because she has noticed how dramatic this could be for a small country, to cover such big banks.
Finally, the total UBS 2007 balance increased more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphical).
"We couldn't save UBS again," said the bank investigator, Geiger.
After the first catastrophe, he followed the second.
A few months ago, UBS had captured a tax difference with America and declared ready to acquire the data of the easily customer, which might have distorted the tax with the Bank's help.
Moreover, she accepted a payment of $780 million - in refunding unjustified benefits from these operations with an increased amendment.
Thus, UBS had more or less aid for tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestigious of discrimination.
At the scandale, the Swiss Secretary has no longer been the same.
It followed by the head of the Administrative Board and the President of the Board of Administration.
And the exode of the customers' money.
Thus, the bank had lost its creditability in the two main business sectors for a few months: the investment of bad speculations and the management of assets due to tax fraud.
And, as there was a little back to the calm, and as we thought, the UBS would go out, it followed this unfortunate story of title markets: a single flamb title market of 1,7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something wasn't going around.
And it is: with the management of the risks in the investment bank, this does not always work.
"In the case of Adoboli, it was found that risk management was too shortly changed," said Martin Janssen, economicist and Professor of Finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich.
"The problem of the UBS is that she has no risk management."
However, it was exactly about the idea of demand, with which the Swiss banks have been taking their function for a long time, that of being guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too large risks, but the security for money - and the world could be able to go beyond the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss banks' treasures became the symbol of an unusual confidence like Lindt and Sprüngli are for a special noble chocolate.
The central of the UBS in Zurich will still partake with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at the central garage of Zurich, which directly leads from the central garage to Zurich Lake, which himself is surrounded by the inclined tops of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the magazines are among the highest of Europe.
The biuters such as Tiffany's, are found here between Swiss traditional magazines as those of Sprüngli's confisery.
Since the centuries of Swiss banks have resided here: from the national bank holding by the Palace of the Swiss Credit to private banks like Julius Bär.
We're coming to the UBS income hall through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are dressed of marble, in front of the walls of glass, and at the bottom of the bank's logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the client searches here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has a day or the other distance from the market - or delivered the two large Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss credit, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank is located.
He would prefer not reading his name in the journal, finally as all Swiss banks he makes businesses with the two large banks.
The UBS would have become too large, especially in the investment, where saxons would also be extended.
The Swiss wouldn't have anything to say anymore.
"And even so long, they have been adapted to the masters of the saxons."
This was actually the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, made high benefits and then debt: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub-premium jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became manifest on 15 October 2008.
"This Thursday, the government coalition of the small country to seven million residents has undertaken the largest salvation operation in the history of their nation," wrote the author Luc Hässig in his book "UBS crash".
Without 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, the political men accepted to save the large bank from failure.
How could that happen?
If we are talking to Swedish banks, they see the problem especially at the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks concluded in a large group.
A bank has been created, which was already too large for the small Switzerland - and has not yet been recorded a growth.
What helped is that the two pre-decedented banks of the UBS have completed: a rich, but lethargy with a strong point of management of activity in Zurich and a poorer, but some have already stronger internationalized.
Instead, international investment banks have favoured access to many money, with which they could turn a big road.
Two names are associated with UBS: Peter Wuffli, 2001-2007 UBS Group Chef, and Marcel Ospel, sometimes President of the Administrative Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said the bank investigator, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modesty intellectual, which is very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who was scared of a path to the top with the bank's learning."
But Ospel would have done up to the end of Wuffli.
And the wuffli would probably have done a decisive error at the end: "He thought his models were real," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is fair: the exhaustion has occurred before the fall.
The UBS staff remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group has always spoken the same word: destrowning Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the planet.
She commanded the "League Tables" classifications, which documented at that time the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of devises and transactions of mobile values, it played a very important role.
However, business advisers, who had the responsibility, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the "Fixed Income" jargon, there would be a great difference in the largest banks.
UBS would have lacuses at the level of American hypotheches.
To complete this lacuna, UBS started in an aventury, which almost costed her life.
Advanced, it is also the bank itself as a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime movements that have invested.
It was transformed into a massive machine that was packaging and has made the value documents based on the American hypotharchists - but also maintained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to get down.
"In 2007, while the American Immobiliary Market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, the expert.
More euphory is greater than falling is brutal.
A manager after the other had to go, when a term of temptation was more difficult than we thought.
Posts in UBS have become exhaustive and are currently available.
Whoever leads the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a bank strategy for which all proposed business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger has already a idea: to end the investment bank, concentration on goods management, return to Swiss racines.
But the bank doesn't want to go so far.
However, the investment bank must be able to remain in force, as it is done until now.
Thursday next, Sergio Ermotti's bank head wants to present his future strategy in the world.
It was only supposed to be transitional when the bank was separated with surprise from her pre-decedent Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed: he must carry out the UBS business, on Tuesday the Zurich Bank.
Ermotti wants to restore the investment bank to the middle of the 1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
Aic, what does she want to win money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has probably already been asked.
He said until now only that he was going to find a apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.

Intelligent corners spread in towns
In many places, fresh ones are considered as "fish problem" but experts say that these very smart animals haven't been left away from towns for a long time.
Some love them, some others want to get away from them as quickly as possible. The corners belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the claims of residents are multiplied because of sale and sound of animals.
An antidote against the "the problem of birds" is not yet in view.
During the first Ostfriesian symposium on the corners, experts said that it is no longer possible to throw out the towns.
Experts of all Germany have decided on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in towns
Nature protectioners also based the problems of cities on the exode of particularly protected fresh: the use of chemical products in agriculture is more devastated by traditional live spaces.
The chassing, alignment and abbatting typical covering trees made the birds life difficult.
The corners are under nature protection.
There are large colonies with more than 600 cowation couples in Westfalen Soest, northwest, among whom Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
In 2005, a conflicted project had gained negative publicities due to the mask of corners in this region.
Criticals found the capture of birds in pigs and their murder with special brutal gardens.
"The normal exhaustion, probably, doesn't serve anything," found the town planner and Leer landscape, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nids using the water under pressure or throwing the trees often produces adverse effects, said Manfred Kaiser de Lahr at Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals go away, the big colonies divide themselves and spread themselves into other places."
It is obviously imaginable only in exceptional cases such as hospitals, homes of retraite or schools.
"We are obligated to live with them, we can't destroy them anymore."
The problem is not allowed to solve in cities without the periferia, according to the opinion of Mr Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Concevable is a combination of animals' advantage to aversive conditioning and accrocheous offers to allow them to reinstall themselves elsewhere.
Psychology and ethnologic, Uta Maria Jürgen prospected "info panels in place of trontionousness" to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally best support a button on the face with a self-trust dose."
Jürgens co-funded the Ascheberger-Educative-Educational Papers to Schleswig-Holstein, road panels reporting the life of these very smart freaks.
This project was adopted in time by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the voice caused by the birds: "This is a great number of communications, these birds have much to say."
Intelligence and ability of animals are added: Freshes use not only work tools to reach a regular, but they themselves make their tools as work tools.
Ethologists of the University of Cambria have recently tested four freaks, in what way the intellectuality of birds comes.
In a experience, the birds learned quickly that they would make a shooting with stones to reach a larve.
Without much training, they determined that a stone had to have certain worst and forms to spread the platform.
In a second trial, astucious corners will then solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small seal with a larve.
The birds can't reach their bottle with their cattle.
However, the researchers had set railways in their disposal.
All the four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they bought the small seal of the small tuyal.
Three of the four freaks are even succeeded since the beginning.

Personal mass interruption
The new book of Peter Englund offers deepness and generosity. The titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Danger: an intime story of the First World War), begins by a long list of persons that close your heart.
An advice to start: take care of this page and make your bookmark.
In this Roman history of Peter Englund, this list of persons will be your GPS, a balise during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disappointed and disappointed in the worms of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel price of literature.
He wrote a book outside the commune that he described, with exactity, as "a book of anti-history".
It conducts some names with important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and materials.
It is not so a book about what happened, he explains that a "book describes what it could do." There are "sensitives, feelings, experiences, and humor."
"Beauty and harm" summarizes experiences of more or less men and women, both sides of war, young schools and botanists to scalers, with doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Other of war prisoners, some will lose members, become foolish or lose life.
Their lives are here as the clergy of a church: while some extinguish themselves, it's renewed.
The book of Peter Englund is separated from traditional history books.
It brings a demention to the idea that the First World War is only summarized by the terrible war of traced on the West front.
"Beauty and threat" describes fully other war theaters: the Alpes, the Balkans, the East front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers presented in this book are under the rocks; a Christmas Pass in Egypt under the pyramides; the tsee mosques are an internal problem.
This book is embarrassing from the first page.
The war envahises the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as an oragan Katrina that can cover it.
When canon shots stand away, and you are a mother at home, you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons of this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been found by suspects, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspirationist theories, dreams, shoes and sounds."
"Beauty and damage" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a English food in the Russian Army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young marine of the German high sea float.
Their stories are mainly taken from memories, letters and other already used documents.
The versions of their lives may be terrifying or passionating, but they are most preserved by the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them are aware of the privacy and the ability to get out of it.
Reporting the story of a German school, Peter Englund wrote: "Substitute, everywhere."
"Replacement café, fake alumie, caoutcho imitation, paper bandages, wood buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes the "success of rice cut broken in the sheep's grass (and ends with a fake bones of tree) ; the tobacco produced with sucked rains and the sucked skin of the earth's powder; the seeds of trees. "
He claims that "837 authorised substitution meat are recorded in the production of saucists, and 511 replacement coffees are also found."
Some stories face honour and courage.
A American recognises his own pulsion against the salvation and says about the war: "You feel that in all things, it is what men were intended, instead of sitting in a comfortable mistake, a cigarette and a whisky at hand, reading a journal or a best-seller, and rather than claiming that such a vernis is synonymous of civilization, and there is no barbar behind your empeised and clouded chemistry.
In turn, a British soldier realizes that he is able to be strong and that no one will notice or give attention to it.
"When we are resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have a public," he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a secretly convicted man".
Other comments relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of fear.
"The conflict becomes more a story of economic competition," Peter Englund wrote, "a war between businesses."
He takes the argue of what he calls "a new species within the beast of the beginning of the century: the death of well-articulated mass and convinced ideally, in well-sized clothing, which exhibits his mouth while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; both basic behavior and heroism are found.
Peter Englund is talking about soldiers who have tried to get a Venerian disease at the prostitutes to avoid the service at front.
"We find the greatest expression in the highest trade of gonorrhee, which soldiers buy and set up on genital organs in hope of ending at the hospital," he wrote.
"The most unexpected ones apply it to the eyes, which is translated by a life-sect."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flat but not obstinating, perfectly adapted to his humanity task.
In decades of short scenes, he introduces the way war had "founded uncontrolled forces: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, a distortion for religion. "
People begin to ask themselves why their leaders make them a war.
The best works from the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memo" (The Great War and Modern Memory) of Paul Fussel, or "In western nothing more", of Erich Maria Note, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most accommodated thing I have read in a non-fictional work.
I'm not gonna reveal it.
But it's like he had come out of his book, put your hands on the page where the list of people and burned with an aluminium.
By the first fake step, a minutely planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some with antiemeute cases.
The Monday night was selected because the Zuccotti park would be the most empty.
The operation has remained secret from all other high-placed officers and other information from the beginning they would have been carried out in an exercise.
The Commissioner of the Police Raymond W. Kelly was in the heart of the operation, his presence underlined the risks and challenges for the Department of Police.
There could not be repeated episodes in recent weeks, such as use of powder gas against demonstrants, who have gone against the Department Regulation and have generated a solidarity storm for demonstrants.
The operation aimed at cleaning the Zuccotti park of its demonstrators was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared by watching the deployment of employment in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for operation in Zuccotti park.
Police officers receive a better training against embarrassment - anti-terrorist measures that consent to quickly move a large number of police officers - to go on the Lower Manhattan quarter.
The last training session was held on Monday evening, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders given to move to the park have come " last minute "," said a habitual, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few of the police I know and who have been called doesn't know they're going to Zuccotti park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would come there are at the top of the police department's hierarchie."
The city was able to keep a lesson from where the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police wanted to clean the park, but they had been released by hundreds of demonstrants informed about the plans.
Wednesday operation involved officers of various police units, including operational forces of the whole quarter - tens of officers used in special quarters.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, in the way of migrants.
"He agreed to proceed when the park counted at least of people," he said.
Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan's pool, gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.
The recorded lights and messages with high talkers seemed to intimid the manifestants.
While officials in Community business would be pending in the park equipped with their blue-vents, many demonstrators simply collected their business and went away.
No tents were touched before 1 h45, which left time to employees to raise their business.
Other police teams were considered on the period, ready to intervene if there were necessary arrests.
Inside the park, journalists have been forced.
Paul J. Browne, the head of the Department of Police, claimed that this measure was taken only in security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from keeping the intervention inside the park, which was deceived by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that television camera camions on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved to the west through the bullet of manifestants' business areas, including bagages, plastic gazons and feed sacks filled with clothes, teams of the department of the subsection, cleaning all that employees left behind them.
Some demonstrants who have gone have been treated. The images have been distributed on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of manifestants took place near the camping kitchen, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have made a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A decree of people at the epicent of the camp has been thrown into.
Finally, two persons were bound to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called to cut the strings.
No arrest occurred in the park before 3:30, Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about one and four hour later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most of the "power in the public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Es日o, head of the Department of Police, is the best official to be found on the places.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although now, "not governing operations" said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police patienced along the side is the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricads were placed on Cortlandt Street, a shot of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
We have seen the police expanding the perimeter right beyond Zuccotti park.
Several officers, most of the bottles equipment, would even have been seen to push people to remote them.
Approximately 28 people found themselves on the north side.
One of the livest actions of the night has occurred in the south of the park.
About 5 hours, on the south of Pine Street, a protestant dropped on a police car capote. Others were seen to cover the pools of a police truck.
At a moment, a bit of contra-plaquet arose by flying from the people.
Finally, a police officer and a manifestant were hospitalized.
The Syndicat of School Aids continues the city for licences
The syndicat that represents hundreds of school aid that lost their employment in the last month provides for a deficiency in the city for unusual and discriminatory licences. The impact is disproportionated on schools that receive defavorized schools.
Consequences are probably the last arm of the Syndicat, the 37th District Council, to try to make licences.
Six hundred and twelve school aids, parent coordinators and other employees, who were part of the least paid in the city, lost their employment on 7 October. The syndicate leaders compared these licences to a political vengeance so that they did not let the city access to a health care fund managed by workers groups, which would have allowed to close the budget art at the last time.
The municipal authorities have denied this category.
During a audience of the municipal Council last month, Channel Dennis Mr Walcott stated that licences were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied that the licences for school aid were no longer exposed to the budget.
The Officers of the Council of 37th District stated that they would comply with a statement of claim, warning the Department of Education that he would continue; a press conference will be organized on Thursday to officially announce the Judicial prosecutions to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be the defense party. The complaints will be represented by eight licensed employees, all colored or latin-American, such as most school aid that lost their employment.
Elizabeth Thomas, portfolio of the town's legal department, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons of the proceeding and thus cannot make comments on allocations.
According to a decline of complaints received by the New York Times, the syndicat was deceiting the number of licences in the most defavorised quarter schools in the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, explaining that the poorest schools would lose the most aid because of a regular subfinancing.
While there is no licence on Staten Island, and some in the Upper East Side institutions or TriBeCa, 17 school aids have lost their job in the 23th district of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of the South Bronx quarters.
Noteing the loss of five schools on eight employed in Harlem 36, where 68% of schoolers live in poverty, the consequences say "This is not a quarter of easily parents who can bring funds to combine the budget lack."
The budget of the 36th budget was reduced by 3.26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city changed its additional funding calculation for each defavorized inscription.
The syndicat also states that school directors could be misled by some terms in a memo authorising the license of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "overcast" to describe the action, even if "overscale" is more generally described as the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, "sixty-six coordinators of parents have been licensed" and "not only because of overcoming."
End Mission: Congrès finds an agreement on the question of Libya
Finally, the Republic and the Democrats would have found an agreement to the Capitol on the issue of uphelling in Lybie.
There will have been a successful survival, capture and death of the long-term dictator Muammar Kadhafi and the American integration.
The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senat will take a next Thursday decision, supported by President John Kerry (Demokrate - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arωνta) and Joseph I. Literman (Independent - Connecticut), who appreciate the Libyan people for their rebellion and the American groups for their "courage".
"This resolution consists of honoring the courage of the Libyans while they begin rebuilding their country," said John Kerry.
"This is a bi-partial support for their democratic attitudes."
The language may be unfaithful but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This year, the islators of the two parties were in conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to authorize limited employment of American military forces in Libya.
The draft law has been won by a large bipartisan margin and has never voted in the Senat.
However, on the same day of the failure of the draft law, the Deputy Room also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of American operations in Libya.
The American mission, therefore, remained in a form of islative purgatory - the Congrès quite contrary to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut her grass under his feet.
The indecision of the Congrès has been overcome by the events.
Tripoli was fallen under the insects in aula and Kadhafi was killed last 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Sennat can act now.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulates the Libyan people for his courage and its extraordinary determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their partners of the coalition involved in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the United States national interest to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure take all the support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate or divide the Issuers as last in June?
The Senator and President of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the last version.
His portfolio stated last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the last version of the new project.
In the Capitol, the Chamber must vote in this week a amendment to the Constitution for a balanced budget, a islative priority for almost all the Republics of the Congrès, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other question, to a vote to be held in the Room or in the Senat.
Other issuers have not yet been able to adopt their amendments but it is not without having tried.
The amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 Constitutional amendments to have been submitted to the Congrès on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recursing - the same draft law proposed both in the Room and in the Senata - and others are deeply variables of one.
At least 15 versions of the amendment for a balanced budget are included in the Chamber, and another point that " would control the federal expenditure."
Some of these law projects are identical, but they give their support, including the new Republican who want to sleep their CVs, the opportunity to be "the author" in such a way.
The Law on Budget Control Act adopted in the latest requested the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 Senators were voted for a non-contracting resolution supporting the idea of such a amendment.
Besides the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates during which the members of the Congrès can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrate - New York) wants to set up the limit of two mandates for the Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Demokrate - Illinois) proposed an amendment to ensure the right to quality education and health care, including the subjects.
A amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is permanently proposed, as the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the flag.
Some issuers also want to authorise the cancellation of federal laws if the two thirds of the States are opposed there.
Thus, they are not as quick as the past.
During the 111th Congrès, the Islators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at 110e.
The rate was extended at the beginning of 1990, when the members generally proposed more than 150 amendments each two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senat Library.
But these amendments have not been much more successful than they have today.
The last amendment to have been made - on 27th - was made in 1992 but proposed in the Congrès in 1789.
"Massacree but none" says Gabrielle Giffords during its first television interview since the fusilation
Ten months after a armed man shot him down to Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrate - Ar日na) appeared on Monday night in a television emission, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said that he would be willy before he returned to the Congress.
When he appeared in the television journal "20/20" on the ABC chain, near Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struck to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The emission was too difficult to return after the ball that fractured its crown and crossed the left side of the brain through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the Representative Room to vote on the debt table.
During his first television interview since January fusilation, who killed six people and hurt thirty others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, ried and songed - and qualified her reinstallation of "difficulty".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, answered "only well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaute Mark Kelly, occurred in a special edition of a "20/20 hour", distributed the guard of the output of the new book of the couple titled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The Special Emission has retraced Gabrielle Giffords from the 8 January.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, it was found on his hospital bed, racial head and a wide cicatrice on the front.
She comes to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragements of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a round wheel while doctors learn to exhibit simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word, "Whooi."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords shot another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his little breakfast.
The videos distributed by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' reinstallation: Representatives are ready to sing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spent two hours each day with the doctors, stated not to remember the fusillade.
According to her husband, he was reading an article on the fusilation of 12 March when she stopped her and asked for the first time information about the six killed persons during the accident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison of Missouri and has continued to be treated by waiting for the proceedings.
"There were many dead" said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
When she was restored, Mark Kelly said to Diane Sawyer, she said, "I have been."
"What I would say, "Gabby, you haven't been," Mark Kelly said.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of here, restore and get back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the groups
The event: a galla in Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for veterans without home from the city of New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on impusion, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, marines, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costum-cravate stood at his feet to acclamate it.
"The soldiers, men and women, are considered as heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the premium fund collection.
A high-graded military officer in Gala, who also participated in Amiral Mike Mullen, leader of the United States Armies, saw the role of the groups in different ways.
"They were presented as a species of orphelin," wrote the high-grade military in a electronic court.
I'm sure the organizations had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just mercy.
Absolutely contradictory commitments illustrate the difficult relationships between military and a passionate, but often distant American public.
Praisements are proud to the ships for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they say a few military people.
The public acts more as if he was sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not of all victims" said the general brigadier Sean B. MacFarland, who led the peoples in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it would be that the only way to support us is to take us into the role of evil spirits."
It is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, which do not want to appear unfair or in agreement with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath of the returning groups of Vietnam war was farer.
Thus, most of the disputes about pity have been completely confidential among the veteran.
After the return of his two sons of the fight against the Marines, the Colonel Mark Cancian retraite warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurance and traveled to remote countries.
Others would ask if "a wrath and violent veteran is hidden under the surface " said Cancian, who was in Iraq and returned to work at the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who made him passed would subtilly ask if he would be able to keep the job stressed immediately after returning to the fight.
"When you talk about the issue of the service, you are confronted with negative initiatives," reminds Colonel Cancian when he talks to his sons.
Military difficulties are partly occurred from the American inefficace against wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a small family country with the army and sees a few direct benefits from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we do not value the heroism anymore as for the Second World War " says the General Retraite Leader David Barno, who managed the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of political and people are largely focused on the depth of a military soldier's sufffrances.
The groups are recognised for the number of sustained services periods, the number of lost friends or the expansion of wounds.
Army faced with the growing pressure of severe violence
This week, a capital audience will decide whether 28 men and women will proceed against the army for an inaction imposed on violations.
If appropriate, hundreds of claimants will prepare the next.
The soldier of the first class of Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and forty-five weeks on the night where she claims that a soldier has been violated.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her cabinet at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a beer package.
He asked her if he could join her in his room to drink a drink.
"C" was a signal of alarma," Elizabeth Lyman says.
But Texane put her anxiety on the side.
I thought he was 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'd have to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after he was entered into the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man took it behind, casted by the ground and violated, before it.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still in service and others, will be anxious for the decision of justice during a historical proceeding that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether a proceeding against the former secretary of defense will be taken against Robert Gates and his pre-decedent, Donald Rumsfeld.
These are accused of not stoping the generalization of violations in the armies, thus against the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, involved in the department of 17 complaints. This number increased to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all believe that they have been sexually violated or misuseed by soldiers. They also claim that the army did not ask, continued or provided justice after the attacks.
Susan Burke says to take it to the Galonian soldiers, because the problem begins with them.
"The Army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are individuals in the position of "repressal culture"?
The lawyer also states that since the month of February, it was contacted by almost 400 other persons, most of them could be part of future Jewish prosecutions.
His strategy: instead of racing all the complaints in this case - thus putting all eggs in the same pair - it will try to make several procedures, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defense Team for the Defense Department, managed by the American Advocate Neil MacBride, has made a motion to reject the case.
The Jewish documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and mainly the fact that the army cannot be continued by soldiers in service or not for vulnerables caused by armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme Court, named the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for vulnerations undertaken by the active staff.
"The wound is inherent to the military service of claimants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence has made any comment.
The things have changed since the 50s.
While women still have, officially, the right to go to fight, this distinction is only inscribed on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely men.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, women's soldiers play a more important role, especially to contact local women.
Results: On these two wars, 150 soldiers lost life - two thirds in war situation.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone to lead this fight: three other proceedings are in progress.
In Yale's rights, the Veterinary legal services centre prepares a case against the four main military academys for encouraging mexican ambition.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America's non-governmental funding prepares a trial against the Army, focusing on the "personality trials " assigned to the victims of violence to give them a conjunction - a relative fact, a activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service of Women's Action Network ( military women's network), a group of human rights.
His group intended a procedure in December to the Veteran Administration, making them discriminatory practices in order to deal with the requests for benefits for people who declared have been victims of sexual agression in the service.
Nine independent law projects were submitted to the Congrès by a bi-partial mixture of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual agressions were recorded according to the Intervention and Prevention Centre (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual agressions is under-estimated. In fact, according to Pentagone's own estimation, this number represents about 13,5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report in March also studies the percentage of Judicial prosecutions: In 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army were subject to a process - half of the percent of the civil juice system.
Susan Burke's complaints describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumatisms.
In Lyman case, she reports the military police of violence less than one hour after the facts.
This night, she said, we asked her to report 11 times in detail his violation to different police, doctors and commanders.
She dropped a "hape kit" (literally a kit of viol), and the blood of her aggressor - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge, at a trial during which it was questioned about its sexual relations with his little friend early on the day of his aggression.
Six people have witnessed as moral witnesses for the criminal author, which has been purchased.
"I remember the day the verdict has been made," Elizabeth Lyman says.
"I thought I was supposed to start having contracts, and I started crying after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember said to my commander, "It wasn't his trial but my."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who has ended with a problem of personality, which makes it inappropriate to the service.
In January 2010, it was sent in terms less than honourable, preventing any benefit.
Is the case of Lyman and other complaints going on or not, it's a long story, says John Turley, professor of right to the University of Droit of Washington.
However, he noted, "My opinion, they should be able to progress."
Only this criticized doctrine since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized Dr. Feres.
The army is in decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of dissuasion by the responsibility.
"The chances are hard against them... but it's important that they try," he says.
These things only change when good people have the will of themselves.
If the proceedings are not in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the claimants, will raise its hundreds of other complaints for other proceedings.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until we die, one or another of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before become the new face of the right extent in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who was part of his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who was recognized to have been taken by a murderful blame in Norway in July of 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on the cyberspace: he had passed a large part of the time attacking his owner, to discuss with some million nationalists who support the extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this year, researchers want to learn more about these people.
But how can you find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a report recently made by the DemoS reflection group on the digital population in Europe.
Facebook cares about so many personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that the researchers could simply use the public tool of the site to find people they are looking for with a scientific precision - the way the sea scientists do it for years.
The Team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that half million members are fans of the right extreme groups in Europe, which aimed them with announcements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the announcements invited users to answer an investigation. The issues raised concern their education level, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism on their own future.
In contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his stakeholders could ask 10,000 parties from 14 extraordinary parties in 11 European countries - without abandoning the office.
"This is a new way to search," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not very surprising: online rights partyers are men, young and against immigration.
But amazingly, "those who associate online and outline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer."
The DEMOS study is only an example of how Facebook has become the new inconvertable tool between scientists' hands.
Reflecting groups, medical researchers and polytologs use the site to study all the subjects that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "J'ima", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who have averagely three contents per day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in the field of research and increases the number of research travels that the site's name appears in the title of almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the benefit of Facebook lives in the fact that it allows you to study people you can't approach the street.
"Before, when you were trying to do questions about the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and treat health and social problems.
According to a recent study of the D. Megan Moreno of Wisconsin-Madison University, and of its students, young students who talked about Facebook about their drinking businesses had much more opportunities to be alcoholic than the students discrete to this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that students, such as advisers, will monitor the site and intervene in order to help a student whose status would speak too of alcohol.
"You can't cope with a problem if you do not," Dimitri Christakis, Megan Moreno's co-autor and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, states the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children with risks, and they would not be in another case recognizing."
Facebook also continues to accept information from its users.
The website's careing team studied statistics on the loving situation and the day of the Holy Valentin, the rate of participation in the elections in the mid-mandat 2010 and a national happiness index (without only available information - digital freedom champions have long supported that the site could provide its data stock for other people to research).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, that it pleases or does not - in exchange for playing in Scrabble with a friend who is at thousands of kilometres, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a question they haven't even heard?
While researchers have well-defined consignments about how to collect information other than using the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't think a lot of users had already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist in the London Cognition Laboratorium, according to a 2006 study that he conducted by watching Facebook walls of his students.
"When they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then the question of methodology comes.
Even without the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two things totally different," Neil Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block-nots and one remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing will be able to replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies should be affected by social aspects - and social, it is not before a trainer."
"Froid and inhuman": first comparison of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted that he had organized the two attitudes that killed 77 killed in Norway this year, described as a fighting "resistance" at his first appearance to the process that was in Oslo.
"I am a military commander for the movement of Norwegian resist and the temples of Norway," he explains before an audience room filled with 500 people.
"In respect of the jurisdiction of the court, I accuse it, because you have your mandate of organizations supporting an ideal of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't be guilty."
The judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologe because he "not wanted to allow him the opportunity to use this process to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he left Breivik, who brought with him a talk on paper, talking to the victims' parents at the end of the audience.
Judge Nesheim also requested the police to keep Breivik in prison for twelve weeks more, prohibited him to talk to media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor closely all visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
Any thirty parents of surgeons and victims were presented to the audience.
Some have come in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be put behind the bars.
All participated in the audience in the aim of seeing the end of the proceedings.
"I found it cold and unhuman" said a survivor of Utoya at the Norwegian TV chain NRK.
"I wasn't at the point, but personally I was a little advanced after I saw and heard the suspect."
With a shadow costume and a blue cravate, Breivik remained calm and professional during all the proceedings. He looked at the journalists and surrounding in the eye of entering and out of the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a wide movement of "resistance", the judge decided that he was not foolish. He also said that there was no evidence that he had acted with compulsors.
The expectations of 22 July, therefore, are the work of an extremist instead of a whole group of radicals, which may be comforted by some.
But this does not reduce the harm or confusion of all the nations.
"I would have preferred that he was nothing to a monster, but that is not the case," said a parent of a victim.
"This would have been much easier."
7 lessons of Steve Jobs' interview lost in the film this week
After Steve Jobs' death on 5 October, some compared it to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern information.
But what the fans can find more evident in an entrepreneur of Steve Jobs recently found and which will be distributed in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit had comprehensively included the processes and work flows of the products.
He was no doubt a Creator and a dreamer. He was identified to a hippie but was also very medical and organized, as well as a improver of organs - a man who believed that many business leaders would suffer from a "maladie let them think that a genius idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a significant quantity of handwork separate a generous idea of an exception product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series retraces the computer's birth, and he sits for more than one hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, that was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He had already worked hard on his new NeXT computer company, with regard to a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It's just after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the garage of the performer.
This video is the foundation of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be distributed on Monday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate deep enterprises, Steve Jobs ́ here amazingly enthusiastic to expose philosophy and his commercial strategies.
And incredible.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the issues - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs has to bear his thoughts in order to bring a precise answer.
There are also times where Steve Jobs' perfectionism is resurrected, where he is impatient to hear Cringely's questions, which give him cohesion to accelerate and pass to questions or subjects of greater importance.
Before Pixar's age, iPod or iPhone, we find an extraordinary aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he thinks of good or bad in other companies and is part of his own view of the future of the informal.
It's a thing to read the post-human evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something of brutal and inspiring on the man we see here, the anxious dream at the watch of size.
He has a view of how things can be and must be.
He explains them and then implements the following steps.
Here is a quick recapitulative of seven notable sequences of Lost Interview:
The way he learned to conduct a company:
"— All these years, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers are continually the same: "Oh, just because you have to do them."
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details about its efforts to simplify accountability in Apple.
Perplexe about the way the costs were stored - often begins by a standard cost evaluated for nose, and then adjusted with a "citation" - he developed an automaticized company that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour in Pape:
Steve Jobs ra -- the anecdote of the "Boyte Bleue" that he created with Steve Wozniak - an apparatus that served to pirate telephone networks and phone freely in long distance.
The camera has made the object of many writings to the preliminary, but Steve Jobs' euphory here in its description of the Bleue Box as an appropriation act is contagious.
He describes the way he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, using a call and then connecting from a AT&T network to another, converting as far as possible satellites.
"We developed the bullet of various things a half twelve times and you shot in the public phone and it came to you a minute later at the public phone nearby," explains Jobs with a laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Bleue Box, we learned that we could create something able to control billions of infrastructure dollars throughout the world."
We didn't know a great thing both of us, but we knew to invent a little thing that could control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there would be a day without this.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak put on: he phoned the Vatican with the Bleue Bleue box in the beautiful middle of the night by going to pass for Henry Kissinger and asked to talk to Pape.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchie are invited in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomate, both companions are deeply laughing before the Pope himself is wakened.
About her love with the Property (and Bill Hewlett's traveling):
At the age of 12 years, at the chassing of pieces to manufacture a frequencymeter, he looks for the number of Bill Hewlett in the year and pass a shot.
Soon after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a wonderful influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age, and it formed my definition of a company and how the employees were treated."
Steve Jobs then became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research workers, held in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "the first office officer ever designed".
He was as big as a valise, had a little catholic tube, and I fell in love with it.
The adolescent I was returned to HP and began to write programs for this machine.
About improving innovation:
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about revending new products on a head-coat.
At the beginning of his career, while he is installed to sell some printed circuit cards, a customer asks him to have a complete manufacturer.
Only 30 days of credit, it must take care of the assembly and the delivery of finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he remembers difficulties to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember great disputes... I was crying on a preacher that I needed five years [to make a mouse that cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a conceitor."
Fourth-twenty days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would be incredible.
On the biggest businesses that slipped:
Before it did not make Apple live, Steve Jobs had preceded the way many industrial leaders were going to find and lose the control of their marketing.
"Let us assume you worked at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copy or a better printer, and then?"
You have the market monopol, so the company doesn't meet any more success.
The wines and marketing can develop it, so [this are the types of persons] that end by leading companies and the specialized staff in the product are placed in the art of decisions.
The product genius that led to this monopol position is completely covered by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have kept all the information industry.
She could have made its current size ten times. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They threw the defect to the victory.
Innovation as an artistic form:
"A large handly work part separates a genius idea of a exceptional product... while you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn greatly about his subtilities.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, businesses too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (this concepts) by gathering each other together.
Finally, the decisions are taken by go personal. It is to try to expose you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said one day that good artists copy and that big artists want.
We're always crazy to steal out of great ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked over were musicians, poetes, zoologists, historians, who simply had the best scientists in the world.
If this is not for the informatic science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health law while the court is gathered together
On the day the Supreme Court meetings to examine the issue of political discouragement, which is whether the opposition to the President Obama of Health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and chairrence Thomas, were observed at a dinner parked by the lawyers' cabinet who will defend the case before the High Court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered themselves for a conference aimed at discussing petitions for examination.
One of the cases concerned concerns a procedure intended by 26 States to contest the reform of the environmental health care voted by the Congrès last year, which had been a point of dealing with military conservators at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a 5-30-hour monumental argument is expected in March Next, and the result will probably be of nature to promote the destabilization of the presidential course of 2012, which will be in full extent when the decision of the court will be made.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will be the same Paul Clement, who served as a general applicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The legal cabinet of Clement, P.C. Bancroft, was part of the two thousand cabinets that helped the annual dinner of the Federal Society (Federalist Society), a long-term group dedicated to defense the conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet, Jones Day, was one of the commercs that contested the law, the National Federation of independent enterprises (National Federation of Index)
Another promotor was the pharmaceutical gentleman Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial injury in the result of the litigation.
The dinner was at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court's conference on the case.
It was, among others, Mitch McConProperty, the Republican top of the Senat and the opposite of the health law.
The invitations seen at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: both judges have been presented to the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against deontology rules.
In fact, judges are excluded from conduct code which regulates the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would certainly argue by the Canon 4C Code, which states: "A judge may assist funding collections of organizations related to the right and other, although the judge cannot be an intervenant, an honorary invitation, or an appointment on the programme of such events."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two of the lawyers of the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to alarm the government ethical activists.
"This violation of ethical and great indifference in relation to the code contradicted the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges boy and dinner and a collection of gala funds with advocates who have cases in the court."
Their presence and their participation in the funding collection of this event demonstrates any claim of unpartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little attention to the critics claiming that they are too easily mixing the cases of the cold with the group agenda such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservator.
Moreover, the conservators suggest that the judge Elena Kagan has a ethic problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general applicant for the administration of Obama when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the court of first instance.
Her critics were pressured to make Kagan excuse to hear the case, saying that she was too invested in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication she would do.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for online aircraft
Aeroplane Emirates commands 50 Boeing 777, bi-cool aircraft, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sell six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market estimated for more than a billion dollar.
There is nothing extraordinary for a company to receive a command containing 50 of its products.
In contrast, it is a case when the company concerned is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and that the amount of these 50 aircrafts reaches the record sum of $18 billion.
It is also incredible that Boeing received this command: the Middle-Orient, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In Monday previsions, the Chicago company considers that the Middle East aircraft companies will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 aircraft of a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed the most dear commercial aircraft order of his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-cools.
It's the Emirates Air Company based on Dubai who passed this Pharonic Command.
Boeing announced in Dubai Airport Room 2011 that the aircraft is also able to buy 20 more aircraft, which would have the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated that the Oman Air company commanded six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model of important fuel and commodities for passengers.
The amount of these six apparatus is more than one billion dollars.
"This is very positive for Boeing," Neal Dihora said, an analysis of Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have a great value."
In the Middle East, oil producers countries have many of their aircraft companies.
They have, therefore, not only the means to pay these aircrafts, but a mount of the fuel price - of damageable habit for air companies because it represents their most important costs - it would not be so damage to them because the country would win money with the mount of the price of oil.
This is a important point because these companies will be less possibly than others of a·a· or to distinguish their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The Emirates command strengthens Boeing's predomination on the market of large-porting airports and helps to reduce the temptation of airbus competition with its A350 airplane.
The victory of Boeing at the aircraft room comes four months after Airbus' announcement to report the beginning of the largest version of A350, which directly rivals with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus repairs its starts to increase the move on the request of its clients to increase its loading capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's actions increased by 1.5% to reach 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the Mexican President manifestly in Michoacán's elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says that drug traffickers have helped its opposite Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the course of the Governing Board.
The President Felipe Calderon's sister had lost his efforts to access the Governing Body of Michoacán during violent elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of its opposers.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the institutional revolutionary party, or PRI, was headed on the course of the Governing Board of this Western State.
"The intervention of the crime organized during all the voting process and particularly yesterday is a alarmant fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon reported to the radio during an interview on Monday after elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... they made up urns, installed road bargage... and forced people to vote" for the Price.
The PRI has governed Mexico for seventy-dix years to lose the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo has only been observed a little of Calderon, who was headed on the reviews before the election day.
Calderon, candidate to the Conserving Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, has recognised Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, Left candidate from the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently occupies the Governor's functions, has come to the third, a painful deficit before the presidential presidential of 2012 for this divided and unfortunately.
Aureoles also recognised the first results.
Vallejo, the former Master of Morelia, the capital of the State, has denied all the connections with drug traffickers and has deeply advised the other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by the cartridges of drugs specialised in marihuana, heroin and metamphetamine trafficking.
It is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch an offensive military offence against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence continued.
One week before the elections, a PAN maid was held when he was campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates were rejected locally to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, both corrupt as Michoacán's elections had air, a victory will help the party in his elean.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the course of Presidents, Enrique Pena Nieto, welcomed Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraged for the next year."
The BASD strongly encourages Asia to come in aid to the euro area
The Asian Development Bank requested India and China to prepare for the euro area to go out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid long-term decreasing that would prevent the development of the Asian Economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director-General of the BASD based in Manille, stated that the two economic powers to the fastest growth in the world of "do all that is in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties of an "indiferent eye" and reported that a Asian financial support from the leaders and resources of Europe would be allowed to avoid a long-term evacuation of the World Economy.
"We're all in this crisis."
"For this reason, whoever can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said to Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point but it is not open."
"When China and India can help, nothing prevent them."
In recent months, the euro area was seriously exposed by a crisis of the suverage debt.
Recently, the cost of the Italian imprisonment is dangerously mounted in the street, and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have dismissed.
The flexible crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe led to the fear that the world economy would not return back to recession, and stressed the call for the main economics to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag claimed that the FMI would bring all Asian assistance, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - as buying the obligations of the United States Financial Security Fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - would offer a greater power of negotiations to the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Indian Industrie, pointed out that "India will do whatever it can" to help the euro area because its own economy now suffers from a decreasing of exports and a deterioration of foreign capital arrivals.
"Nobody wants the euro area to remain instabil and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to rise and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"What isn't a choice, it's a imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others support that development economy such as India should not help European riches while they face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor of the Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically difficult to accept aid in Europe at 1.2 billion Indians, whose at least 800 000 lives with $2 per day, even less.
"Every day, they will discover that the Greeks take their retraction at 50 years and that they go in vacation to the sun and they will be in trouble with it," he reported.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why the reservations of India should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek employees in badly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the railway sector.
Mr. Nag stated that the crisis in the euro area was able to cause " significant impacts" through Asia.
The previsions of the BASD of a economic growth of 7,5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now faced with "the loss risks" due to European threat.
He noted that vulnerable markets needed to "build "score plans" to protect themselves from economic and important capital refunds.
Severe Pentagone warnings on the potential reductions of defense
The Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, pressed the Monday Congress, warning that imminent automatic budgetary compressions would know the national security, and that the Pentagon boxes were reacted to the Afghanistan battle fields, with civil races.
The Pentagon already deserves $450 billion for the next decade, but it now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more of compression would be imminent if the Congrès does not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the Ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Ar日na and Lindsey Graham, R-Suth Carolina.
He stated that the failure of the Congrès to reach a budgetary agreement resulting in the name of sequestration would lead to 23% of reductions and the ice of many new projects.
"A so important reduction, so applied without discernment, would make the majority of our vessels and projects of inexable building - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a ship - and have seriously reached the other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to the Senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a certain number of our civil staff, and because the reduction would be so quickly imposed, we should almost have to send civilians in a free salary to reach the goal."
"These changes would distort the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting groups, continued Panetta.
"Because the financing in war-time of contingency operations to the foreign is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The contracting staff would be reduced, providing delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts supporting war."
"The staff that manages the salaries would be reduced, providing payments to war providers, and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two Senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, asking details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Defence Minister.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would have started a rapid decline of the United States as a worldwide leader of military power."
"We are fairly opposed to this draconic action," Senators said in a common Monday afternoon during the publication of Panetta's letter.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not what we should impose."
"Sequestration is a threat to the United States national security interests, and it should not have to happen."
Let the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of Senators increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or a call to release the Pentagon of reductions, remain to see.
Panetta was more virtual about possible compressions, even though it has reached himself to the highest position of the Pentagone, which has come to the years of the budget expertise in Congrès and the White Maison, and knowing that he was confronted with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense pointed a shadow table of what could happen - a military with a cocktail, but not a noise.
"It's a ship without sea."
"It's a brigade without balls."
"It's a shot air, without enough pilots."
"This is a tiger in paper, a army of cashers, bathrooms and bombs that have not enough soldiers who can fulfil the mission," Panetta said in its preliminary comments at Pentagone.
"This is a depressed, badly prepared force and unable to face potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites an agression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta expressed specifically how new reductions for "generating important operational risks: time of response to crisis, conflicts and disasters; serious limits to our ability to deploy and engage us in the world; and risks are unacceptable in future fight operations".
And Panetta stated that some of the largest defense projects could pass to the cover, including those already tested and some just at the first stages of the planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bombarder, the Balistic subseas of new generation, the new ship of literal fight and the new land vehicle, which would replace the Army and Marine Humvee.
A term for the development and testing of F35 could generate 80 billion economy dollars for 10 years, but its partners say that it is a key step to improve and respond to the potential threats of China and others.
How to Repent a Liar
A view of recent manchettes indicates how much troppery and lying are in the daily life.
The Republican candidate to the President Herman Cain is occupied with exchanges of sexual liabilities with a number of women; each side is the other to lie.
The Penn State administrators have been accused of rejury for prejudice to reports which a football leader to the retraite was sexually aggressed by boys.
The last week, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a open microphone to the US President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the Célébrity of the Internet Anthony We Sieve has passed for a idiot by quickly putting contradictions by irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate to President John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to the cover of an extra-conjugale connection.
And then, none of the people who saw the story will never forget the median circle that President Bill Clinton deceived during his second mandate on his sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky.
The trichery stories at the tests of the olive and the university are ion.
There were cases where teachers gave the responses of tests to the tests in order to make a good view of their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary shall send the message which lies and trickery is acceptable.
How many troppery do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are bad lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or repeating lies is a key competence that everyone must purchase, both for personal and professional reasons.
Rather than being a society game like, say, chardas, where the goal is to be: "I have you," the detection of troppery is a serious knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades in prestigious universities who have conducted a deep research of such projects, including psychology and physology.
One of the results of the research is that the elderly myths on the lie have been dismissed.
Lighters look at you in your eyes.
They don't beg, they're red, or they're not always acting.
Do not conclude that men are difficult to detect and difficult to hide.
A qualified lying detector can discover the truth by examinating the structure of the statement, the micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of response.
I have spent several years to examine scientific results in the broad body and always excite knowledge of the troppery, and it is also that the detection of the troppery is a modern competence that is easy and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include emphasis, interviews, negotiations or management.
Good mentors are able to read others well, by putting them in appeal, by giving their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others understand them.
We know, according to research that extravertises lie more than introvertises, that men say more lies "centered on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people are less often lied to their partners than those who are not married (but the lies they raise are tend to be great).
We also know that if you are imagined as an unbeliever, the others will feel less guilty to lie to you.
How can you say if someone lies?
On the other hand, watch the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we're calling "building data".
This helps provide a reference point to measure the following changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laughing, vocal quality.
You must know if someone normally removes his feet permanently so that you don't start injustices when you'll put him in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for indicators of verbal and non-verbal behaviour behavior.
Consider these indications as red flags, not evidence of troppery.
Trumpy people can immobilize the body's top when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, pick up to an output, change the posture significantly or present a "post-interview" supplies - an exagered supper, a posture change when all difficult issues have passed.
Questioners often falsely indicate that the maintenance is completed just to try to deal with the post-interview reaction.
Therefore, take care of your vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson was deceived by using the past in a statement that his wife was alive, starting a national research to find her.
Trumpy individuals can also use a remote language: "I haven't had sexual relations with this woman... Mrs. Lewinsky" or repeatedly a difficult question.
The most common word indicators are subtil.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to say true... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the reasonable answer rather than fair and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of powers to recognize troppery is possible.
These competences will improve the opportunities for anyone to avoid victimization by archers in their professional and personal life.
The controversed oil plan will be eliminated after the late approved threat of the United States
A few days after the administration of Obama threatened to repeat the approval of a project of oleoduc between Canada and the Golf of Mexico - providing the wrath of the syndicates while pasting the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oleoduc says that it is ready to redirect the project to send it on the rails.
TransCanada stated on Monday evening that she would move the designed pipeline out of the Nebraska's area, and it is confident that the project will even win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitole du Nebraska.
The Officer of TransCanada, Alex Perbax, states that the company remains confident that it will end with the approval of a oleoduc, but with a different journey.
This results in the announcement by the State Department last week that he would deteriorate its decision to grant a federal authorisation for the project until he receives new studies of potential trainers to avoid the areas of the Nebraska domains and the Ogallala acquisition, of large subterranean water sources.
"This is a real way to the front," says Lee Terry, a republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental examination of the Department of State would probably have rejected any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officers denied the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State and expressed its support.
The oleoduce of 2,735 km would be from Canada to Mexico golf.
He would transport 700,000 bars per day from the province of Alberta to the Texas raffiners.
In order to do this, he should pass six States.
It is hated by the →logists, but loved by working groups, which put on the 20 000 estimated jobs related to oleoduc.
But the Islators of Nebraska that are opposed to this plan pressure that a law for strength is the distance from the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala acquisition, a great source of potential water and irrigation.
The environmental impact study during the Department of State found that the project would have only limited environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the General Ministry Inspector ordered a distinct investigation from the review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist involved by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is to know if a company who was embauched to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continues for prejudice caused by a young child to breathe
A family in New York states that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle in a divorce of violence in Manhattan's hall of their immortality, threatened their little daughter at the point where she was afraid.
The song "Lady Marmalade" feared the young Genevieve Monk 18 months old, as it had been "the changes of personality, the troubles of sleep" and "the great fear of foreigners", said her family during the process of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was on 10 November of the last year, while the Kevin Monk scene technician, his teacher of children's garden, Rosene, and Geneva, would be prepared from family traveling.
While Kevin Monk was going to search for the car, Rosons Monk descended into the hall of their immortality of the Riverside Riverside with their baggage, bringing Genevieve in his arms.
Rosen Monk said she was stopped near the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Who came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said "yes" and I went to look for her," she said.
LaBelle admonished the wrathful woman.
"He said to me about an aggressive ton, "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Rosen Monk.
"I answered him, "what you say or think you don't care about me."
She became injured and started using jurons - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to shut me out of the bottle's water.
She said that at this point, Geneva became historical.
"I said to this woman, "Remember what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle was cut off on her mother - who always holded Genevieve in her arms - and had to be arrested by its surrounding that brought her into a car that waited for them, said Rosions Monk.
The little girl would cry so strong that she started to smoke.
Later, the family sent an apologizing note of LaBelle's excuses but received no answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives have not returned our calls to comment.
The claim calls for unexpected damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he took the case freely and that the family intends to give all money to a work of charity against cancer for children.
"The purpose is to maintain Patti LaBelle responsible for its conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a mother teacher with a 18-month child."
Economy's climate opposition
During the first year of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, the unemployment and informality increased, the foreign investment has fallen and the economy has been contracted
2011 is a year in which we will be remembered in the Sinaloa economic story, this is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, who has been called on the change, which has generated great expectations for the economic progress, but because of the climate adversity from the beginning of the year, the growth is not observed, in exchange, the main economic development indicators are detected.
The low temperatures of the FEV have, rather than caused billion losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the State's growth economy, caused a contraction of the economic activity in general by 3,6 per cent in the first semester of the year, which was primarily justified by the history of 31,16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamic of other economic sectors.
According to the report of injuries issued by the Mexican Rural Development Council, 582 million 835 developed hectares were damage, which had 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main accumulated cultures were the eyeums, the magic and the chicken fish.
The decrease of the economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in the unemployment in the State, the National Institute of Statistics and Geographical rate of the State's unemployment during the first three trimesters of the year was observed, since since January 55 billion 053 synonyms were unemployed, with a rate of 4,53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second trimester the rate was 5,28 per cent and the average continued to grow up to 6,19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74,000 sinlons, a growth compared to the first semestre of 18,969 people.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, ­ the Economy Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS Economic and Social Science Facility, can be expressed indirectly in accordance with the actions carried out by the Policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of the resources approved in the Congrès legislation to fight the whiteness of money, because for people who win dollars in a illegal manner it is not easy to work to win them, to invest them and to use them in something," he said.
Migration detained
López Cervantes reported that the growth of unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the State to go to work in the foreign, the United States have been restricted because of income difficulties and secondly because they already have many difficulties to find work, these people remain here and ask for work sources, which make the unemployment grows," he said.
Missing serious
The analysis of the Sinaloen Working Market increases considering the high level of lack of seriousness that pre-doming between work conditions, INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population occupied in this state, without being covered as a worker in any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for discharge for the state is the lower payments, the entity has the lower payments of the country, the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Working Secretariat and Social Prevision.
The average monthly income of synonymous workers has been 5,000 352 weights, very lower than the national average, which is 7,000,375 weights.
IED contract
In addition to the decrease of the economic activity and the growth of unemployment, in 2011 the highest reduction in Investment Etranger in the past 10 years was recorded, the Secretariat of the Economy of January to June reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to 5 million 143 million 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion weight per year, mainly recorded by third sector companies.
Leave this
Since the economic contract scenario, the Government of the State requested in July to approve a 3 billion weight credit for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State's congress was 2,600 billion weights, and until November no benefit was observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the patronal sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Room of the Transformation Industrie, stated that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, such as the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year was really very poor, we need to work intensely to recover the land we have lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all, and especially the good course already synchronized by this new Government team, hope that the next year is much better," he said.
Economy Lentor
Loredo López stated that events like yellows from the beginning of the year have kept the state's economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including iron, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn quickly to generate a economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable e-flux level in processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year, we are closed much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine Call
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Conference of the Mexico Republic of Sinaloa stated that we want to channel the State to more dynamic activities.
"In general, we have noted that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that re-defines State vocation and economic direction, because it is important to detonate all the potential of Sinaloa's maternal and humous resources," he said.
Many to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that improves the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in various areas, in the fields of economic development, there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of the policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked much and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do," he said.
Conduited for 8 kg of marihuana
A resident in Novolato was condemned at five years of prison and 100 days of adoption for eight kilos of marihuana.
The General Park of the Republic has informed that the small convicted trading is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crime against health, in its marihuana property variant for sale.
In accordance with the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a supervisory operation in the Cipriano Valdez Street, before the number 80 of El Castillo, Navolato.
The small traffiker was in a type pick-up truck, of white color, where he was transporting a black color sack in the port of the vehicle and on the place of the childhot a small bowl bag where the soldiers found eight kilogramms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were available to the Second Court of the District and the conviction is still located in the Centre of Execution of Legal Consequences of Delities.
This to the contributions to the books
The social characteristics contempted in programmes such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for public areas may not be completed where recording serious delays from the lack of economic resources, Miguel Angel López Miranda reported.
The Director of Social Development stated that even if the building programmes have progressed until now, they are in a risk situation, because the State Government has not purchased its obligations to offer contributions exceeding 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He reported that the investment of these three programmes is totally approximately 50 million weights, which the State must provide for 25 per cent, and until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is a chance of a delay in their finishing.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything, even since July they have given us a part of it," he said, "and we, in order to not record delays, have started the works and we have much advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that during the last year, during Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration, the Municipe had to request a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided to that occasion.
"We had already undertaken this in the previous sexual period because the State had no economic capacity to participate, and the programmes continue to work, and this year, to have access to these programmes, we have given the resources to cover what the State had not paid," she detailed.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the authorities of the State to provide these resources, he stated that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finances, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so as soon as possible.
"They have to provide nearly 12 million and, despite the year will be finished soon, they have not given us anything."
The Valid Court of Justice in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analogue signals by digitals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the past years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has deployed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Members have formulated against the presidential decree that has preceded the 2021 to 2015 "Analogue Court" because the eight votes needed to invalid it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, as well as the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his commitments when he issued the decree that detailed the actions to follow in order to concrete the transition to the digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Secretary of the Republic has been deployed to have not reached the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court may speak of the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft judgment, developed by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a regulation reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel) contrary to the principles of hierarchic subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero have voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senat and the Chamber of the Ladies promoted two constitutional conflicts to contest the decree and accepting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided for this for digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also decided to deal with the complaint made by the House of Members without discussing the draft of the Minister Sánchez Cordero also responsible.
In its intervention, the President said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure the measures to prepare it through general standards.
"I also consider that if it had been done, it would be affected by the regulatory body's autonomy," and he reminded that the planning of policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Ex-Agency, which has for the constitutional mandate of the State's direction.
The substitution of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the past years and it is translated into a better operation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more chains.
Updating the change, he supported, would update the benefits of digitalization that include a decision of public interest that does not only have a technical dimension, "for it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "required the operation of a system established, to the principle of the State's economic direction, includes a group of attributes granted by the Constitution to the responsibility of the State's Executive".
He recalled that many countries of everyone have already ended the digital transition and they have done it through the Excipient, despite the fact that they had the strong technical organs specialised.
It is not possible to conclude that the Exekutive, having issued the contested decree, has in a form invaded the Congrès' skill of competence, as it ensures in the administrative area the compliance with the laws issued by the Law.
Analysed is the possibility of a " vote by vote" discount in Michoacán
According to the data provided by PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the Governing Board's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total procedures.
The possibility of the " vote by vote" is the reality of the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where the data made in evidence by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the Governor is only 27 per cent, even without compliance with the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total procedures.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Mary of the Landeral Angles Zaragoza, reminded that the electoral body had approved a series of direct lines to harmonize local standards to the electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán has not approved nor its Political Constitution nor his Electoral Code of State or His Electoral Justice Act, as the State Congrès has approved the reforms a little before he ends the time of the electoral process so that he can enter into force and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has forgotten its publication within the periods laid down by the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the National (SCJN) decided the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the mandatary of the State for Constitutional Reforms, because it does not have the right to sanction or contest them.
Interviewed on the possibility of " vote by vote", Mary des Llanderal Angles stated that by the approval of the direct lines corresponding to the IEM General Council, the partial and all votes will be able to carry out by the local electoral bodies.
Thus, the partial decover of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be: the results of the verbal procedures are not coincident; there is no verbal of audits and decomputes in the dossier of the Urne is not located with the President of this; or there are evidence errors or changes of the procedures.
Moreover, the total decover of the votes received in all urnes of the election can be performed when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the candidate supposed to win the respective election and the one who received the second place in the investigation is equal or under a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is a express penalty of the representative of the party and/or coalition that presented the second of the notified candidates.
The total outcome of the audit may also be achieved if at the end of the common discount it results that the difference between the winner's candidate and the second place's is equal or lower to a percentage point, provided that there is the exposed penitence of the representative of the political party whose candidate is outside, where the electoral packages are excluded from the partial decount.
It is necessary to mention that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting the votes of 129 of the 923 total verb procedures.

The new Italian government will be formed Thursday
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the border of the economic disaster
The named Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Thursday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that caused Italy to be under the economic disaster and threatened the whole Eurozone.
A Chairman's palace announced that Monti, named on Monday, would meet Thursday with the President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it presents a cabinet in its majority of technographs, even if it is not when the new excipient will have its post.
Monti said that he would present to the President the result of his conversations with the political parties in his trial to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tonne of its comments indicated that the obstacles were overmonted.
"The frame is now well traced," he will.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a less time than usually, while Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that moved the costs of its debt at levels impossible to support.
The new administration governed by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard packet of exertity required by the European leaders to restore confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By highlighting the pressure on Monti to avoid, the instability of the markets to place the performance of the Italian BTP obligations at 10 years above 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal Confindustrie, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The possibilities of success in Monti have been stimulated by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, whereas the crisis has committed to dismiss last Sunday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," said the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Centre-Right Party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because many of its members were still opposed to the Government of the Technocratic majority of Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have a strong Parliamentary support to apply what probably will be immortal reforms.
Any blocking or resting in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Property of Foreigners added to the pressure, noting that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday its consultations with political, syndicates and patronal groups and young and women organizations.
He'll finish his turn on Monday meetings at night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has been able to have a very quick transition in response to the crisis.
After a short repeat at the end of the last week, when Berlusconi was able to leave, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty of the success of the new Prime Minister.
To save Italy, with a debt of EUR 1.9 billion, it would be too much for the current financial defences of the Eurozone.
Monti said that its Government should continue until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to apply reforms before making elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the large parties insist on the fact that this should be formed only by experts, a index of their objections before a financial pressure process.
Political sources reported that reciprocal failures and disaccords between parties comply with the trial of political figures.
The experience of Spanish is higher than those of the Coasts
Of 22 footballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convocated attended 50 meetings.
A big contrast with Costa Rica, compared to the 22 convocated by the two countries for today's amical at 15:05 a.m. at the National Stade of San José.
Penso that the national and European campions, number one of the monthly classing of the FIFA, are accountable for a summary record of class A interelectional games, the Tricolore only has the defensor Michael Umana as the only one with the 50 international matches.
This number was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing in the Ligue of the stars and in the powerful clubs of the Prime League of England keep an intense activity in national campionships and disputes in European sculptures, such as Champions League.
To all this, experience with Furia Española must be acquired during the complex eliminations of the European Cow and the Football World.
In contrast, the Coast footballers have a limited international experience to a area, such as Concacaf, which is considered as a lower level in the FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is the guard of Iker Casillas, which the previous Sunday against England (defence 0-1 in London) compared the record of the old guard of the aim Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will put a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, flying from Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even reconstituted in the previous week by EUFA by the other centers of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front center of the Schalke, Raul González, with 102.
Ready from the center number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the side of the coast, and near Michael Umana are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the brian Ruiz butter, with 45.
After that, only five passed over the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those who have more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Searchquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even come to 20.
Pens that Nano Moreal has only four games and Jordani Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still starting.
The history of Spain is David Villa, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to collect two trajectories
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality."
In the interview with Viva, the Jeff Ament bassist, of Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National Stade.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that it will become a real dream for them in this country.
It is that the bassist and founder Jeff Ament assured, speaking with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South America Ail of its two work debt collection tournament and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day they will be presented at the National Stade, from 19:30 hours, next to the group of Los Angeles The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extrait from the conversation, with the full transcription is located in La Nation on the Internet.
For its appetites, the fact that Pearl Jam will occur in Costa Rica is a dream of reality. Do you know what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and this has been greater than now.
I went to Costa Rica only once the vacation; it's a so beautiful country and I think we'll be able to go over there a few days.
This thus motivates us to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity in the past days.
What is your message for your most appeals?
Thank you for staying near us all these years.
We needed 21 years to arise in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much, and we're sorry for the fact that so long it had to pass to this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the largest show of the year.
Is that a little pressure for your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we offered during the last 21 years have occurred in the last two weeks.
We offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has made us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really very impatient to produce it.
We love this country, we love surf and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries of the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to make surf?
We have many surf friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the vagues are incredible there.
My friends were always going to make surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, on the side of Mexico, are large places to make surf; so we have learned it through the surfs that love the surf.
When you saw the tour, you offered great shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced us there, we have no restriction on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible, with a great variety of songs; we'll try to interpret two songs of each album and offer our fans a good and different directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's this worth?
I think it is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, so it is very difficult to choose what songs to interpret every night.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we haven't been interpreted for a long time, it helps us to remain firm and surprise because it reminds us of the reasons we loved these songs and that we could have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and therefore I think it becomes more interesting for people.
With this turn, you collect 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it difficult to believe all that you succeeded?
Yeah, absolutely.
First, I believe that no one of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock group, and that we did it for more than 20 years that it was a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to do music in Property is very emotional.
We love and love creating music.
We are happy to go to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
The things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been an element in the creation of the gronger?
This has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with people in Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a move comes from a group of friends and is uncommon.
At times, a group comes from a city, but it's much more strange when five or ten groups come from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them timely.
Last year, we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we are happy to be still friends with them and it is a honour for us to become part of this sound of Seattle that came up.
It is also very strange that a group as yours remains united and with the same members for so much time.
Yes, four of us have been in chair for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, and this is only much more time than many groups normally.
First, I believe that we all are happy to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this, there are musical boulevards that give freedom to each expert.
We have confidence in each other with the music of each one, and that couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word of célébrity was not easy; however, thanks to your success, you could do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grow, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't have too much time in turn because it's easy to fall in this game of big ability and people who love your music.
If you don't forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we need to respect the music and what it has brought, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written good songs and at first it was great.
We have been a group for almost three years and we haven't made a disk before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations for the fact that she had endured so little and the most important is that we were still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listened to a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me ridicule, it was always a pleasure to work, ridicule, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising man, and we missed him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his job, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it to open it?
Yes, the production sent us videos with various proposals, and that was the group we loved most, so we are impatient to see what Las Robertas can offer directly, and that must be very suspicious.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words directly?
This is a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
It's him who sing it, and I think he's doing it with the first words he's thinking.
As bassist, what are his influences?
There's so much...
Among the first ones I remember there is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many influences that I can talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam succeeded to maintain the grond, despite the fact that this is not the way?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the green word.
When I think of this, this reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have occurred at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I believe that this is wonderful, because it's a music that worth listening, and the groups like Mudhoney do now the best music as ever.
At the beginning, his music had a more dark content and now it became more positive.
What is this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that are more sensitive, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, even if these can sound a little positive.
At the same time, when Ed played for me, I wept when I heard them, and these are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow and there's a traumatism in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and these songs, of course, represent it for me.
I also think we can also be happy and even as we can do it from dark music.

Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle force he presented in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who purchases a 25-year-old penalty for human rights violations under his government (1990-2000), suffers from various affectations, a language cancer for which it has been operated four times and which is under control.
The Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, stated for Canal N of TV that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the Neoplasic National Institute to determine the reason for pain and loss of force in its members.
Aguinaga commented that in its opinion, Fujimori would be a candidate for → the benefit of the remission of penalty for humanitarian reasons, he certainly said that he would not want it because he felt innocent.
He has been operated four times of language cancer, he has a weight loss of weight of 18 kilograms, and other pathologys, such as a severe erotic gastrite, a pancreas kiss, renal calculations, arterial hypertension and problems of ability in the feet, mentioned the doctor.
Fujimori purchased the conclusion since September 2007 in the National Direction of Special Operations of Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for death of 25 persons due to an injury scadron of the army that operated in the first years of his government.
Musica travel to Mexico to consolidate political links
A official court, with the head of the Uruguay President, José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and patrons, will start on Thursday a visit in Mexico to extend trade between both nations and to address the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet the next Thursday with her mexican approved Felipe Calderon, the highest point of a long meeting agenda with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collection of Uruguay residents in Mexico, the agenda distributed by the Uruguay Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in Guadalajara will be "for the exchange of information in the political matters between the two nations", ­ the information provided by the South America Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France when the French mandatary, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax paradises, at the meeting of G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax paradise, a statement that caused Urugvay's rejecting and calling for consultations from its ambassador of this European country.
Mexico has been presented since November the G20, a stronger and stronger group of countries in the world, and has in force with the South American country since January this year a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguay Government has tried in recent years to prevent the concretation of tax exchange agreements to exit from the " grid list" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OCDE), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
On the commercial basis, Mexico and Uruguay have entered into force since 2004 a Free Commerce Treaty (TLS) which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The moustachu floor passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struck infirmablely for 25 years to save the princess Peach from the attacks of the wicked Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he would fight for the love of the youth in stereoscope.
The title, which comes to the stores of everyone this month, has been designed from the beginning to well exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using lunettes.
"Mario is the person who must say how the stereoscope should work without lunettes," said the specialized press responsibility of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez pointed out that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo designed initially for this support", since until now successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adjustments of existing titles.
Nintendo's portfolio supported that, despite being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a quick and fluid part.
Alvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "easy" to cross the less possible users.
Once overmonted, the most experts will be able to make a "second tour" at game levels, which this time are more difficult.
Moreover, users will be able to choose at real time between a "Agressive D" or one who only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and to "soom to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also suggests the return of the person to a mobile console, which has not passed since 2005.
In these video games, Nintendo looks at the saga adeptes and repeats the form of success of previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu plombier must park mines of danger platforms to free Peach princess.
Even if I player find news in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "joyable".
Colom gives its delay to the extraction of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced last Thursday that he had ordered for the extradition of the former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiration for the blanking of $70 million.
Thus, Guatemala shall be ending the proceedings to respond to the request of the North country who claimed Portugal to judge it.
In the press conference, Colom claimed that his decision was obedient to the independence of the judicial and exemptive power, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered its extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate, "He had not helped" in any Judicial resolution and he had given courses to all the extraditions he knew.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extracted for serious lesions and and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Strada Paredes will be extracted for trafficking of stupefiants.
What Colom did suggest an exhaustive approach after all Judicial and Constitutional institutions to judge the former mandatary of the interval 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Penal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portugal should be extracted after resolution of its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteed human rights.
Portillo was exhausted for the decline of Q120 million in the Defence Minister when he was president, which was the proceeding that was the extraction, but the Public Ministry called and reactivated the case.
Trinianov has helped 6.000 young people in risk situation
The entity is born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The balance of the first 25 years of the Social Support Entity Trinijove is important: 6.000 youths in risk of exclusion have received aid to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
This is the long centuries of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The birthday served yesterday to make the balance in a collected act in an ancient industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, which has assisted more than 300 people.
Trinyove was born in the Trinitat Vella quarter in 1986 with the goal of helping the few, without work, with toxicity or marginalised problems.
The collection of yesterday in Sant Andreu has made a large number of entities and institutions responsible for those 25 years.
The different political representation, at the full election session, showed the unity of the work carried out by Trinijove.
On behalf of the President of the Regional Government Catalan (Generality), Artur Mas and its pre-deputy Jordani Pujol, the former Minister for Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former maire assistant and current eco-socialist adviser Ricard Goma.
We also attended in the large Fabra i Coats, the current Ministry of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director-General of Love of La Ca®, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time, and the current is it also, but he said that the work done until now "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinianov an example of fighting the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work that it does," he said.
property envahied by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders were suitable to 11 of the 13 apartments of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 employees abandoned the property to midnight without any opposition
Everything indicates that the cauchemar has finished the residents of Rue Balmes number 51.
Twelve people have voluntaryly abandoned the impression they were illegally occupied in the midnight and where they organized micro-fests that would disappoint the neighbors, according to the Judic order and without the need of an intervention of the police.
At the end of the operation, the door's lock was changed to avoid the situation repeatedly.
"From this day there will be a control of access," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had envahied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest was inhabited -, took the electrical installation and a part of the water, rather than the walls of the walls and left residues of any kind, especially alcoholic drink woods.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass festivals, which would take up to two days and disappoint the hosts.
Near the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press that since its building was acquired of 80%.
The owner of the discetite claimed that the invaders of the property were doing him deliver, because they sold the glass to three euros, while in the discetite they were worth 10.
Moreover, the owner of the loisirs had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the voice, while, this, the concerns were not caused by the clients of the disk, but by the occupied homes, and especially the participants in the organized festivals there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, and the neighbors of the area.
The responsibility of the discrete explained that the injuries were so large that it even made an agreement with the owner of the imagination, and that is nearly nine months that the "forgives him" lodging it.
The Guardia Urbana ( municipal police) also confirmed that in the last weeks they had received more complaints from the neighbors for this situation.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, President of the municipal group of the PP, had asked the last week "the immediate evacuation of the imagine to end with the common and civil problems that he caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The people's leader explained that before the sea only a stage of the building was occupied, but in the past months the squatters had occupied all the stages of the building and almost all apartments and that there were also flights in some apartments.
It is in this sense that he had to end with impunity and to be imprisonable against the antisocial behavior generated in the property."
Yesterday, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in New Barris.
At 15.30 a.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral number 35, after receiving the call of a neighbor who observed that four people were accessing to the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Concomitant texts on the opportunity of convocation beside Polemic on honoraries
The municipal concours on the 16 ports opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 1980s, in full support of the already exposed Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this printed Collserola promotion shows.
The brochure defined the mountain as the Great Park of the Metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, she also contained a comparison in digits with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the higher limit of Barcelona, the catalyst capital is the only one that is not oriented on the north-south axis, otherwise high (montage) - lower (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is the benefit of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with bloods in the role of Yogi's horse.
This was the situation until, in September, the mairi convocated a mega-competition composed of 16 concours for all the gates of access to Collserola.
A door gets to the park idea, without doubt.
That's it, or somebody wants to put the doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The concurrence, both in relation to its organization and in relation to the town's thinking, is a theme of talking about all Barcelona texts.
It's almost a recurrent theme whose two members of this ancient elue cast speak when they are in a rain.
And this is just one of the rare opinions on which three of the teachers of Barcelona, university teachers, have been presented there.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the concours is appropriate.
For Roldán, after being overcome the literal front, "It is necessary" to discuss "the front of the mountain" because the talk of Ildefons Cerda was not finally conducted.
"The most expansive park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the verdict gave the architect for which the title of "Colleserola Ports" refers to a "lexical stage": it is not necessary to think of these "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which you have to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanist world, qualifies the proposal as "intellectual challenges" with "what dangers".
Periods depending on "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience vêd in the 1980s, which had been in the Forum 's song of cygne' area.
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which it can be built.
"Limiting something means to set the next step already," it means its overcome.
"We need to think of new urbanists, planning instruments, because current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause disaster authentics."
More to the question, the Modol believes that by simplifying, the chairman of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be heard as a park, the park of Barcelona, no."
Modol recalls that there is already a work made by the Collserola Patronat, which "does not be lost" by thanking for the opportunity that the Major offers his corporation to intervene in this project "with the first time".
Moreover, he hears that the neighborhood of the mountain with the city is the non-conduct that allows the teachers to enter into the debate, but "due" if this technical profile must guide the multidisciplinary teams ("all a successful," he says) that we have the creation of: "We, the Ethiopians, should be only one instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this parable is complex, because the bases of the concours are missing a global vision of Collserola: "It has been convocated 16 transversal concours - he says - in the sense of the mountain-sea, but there is no longer reading and understanding of the area in it."
This makes at least in this case that he has chosen to participate in the 16 concours.
Another way, a project so that one of the doors can shoot in the program and definition with the architect of the nearby gate.
In its opinion, yes, the mairi should ensure that the band immediately exceeds the Ronda de Dalt, in all its holding, should provide an area of equipment that makes a sweet transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this will be free
After 72 days of temporary arrest, the foundation of the Casino Red has granted forgiveness to the brother of the Major of Monterrey for the proceeding against him for pre-singing songs
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released in freedom after the foundation of the Casino Red power grants him forgiveness before the Second Penal Court of the District, which follows a procedure for changing against the brother of the Master of Monterrey.
After Casino Royale's expectation, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, had a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás assumely requested him to pay a financial quota to allow Monterrey's maire to function the clandestin of the game house.
After the denunciation, the Parquet opened a criminal proceeding against the brother of the PANist Master and on 2 September it was arrested and held in temporary arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agency of the Public Ministry of Patrimonial Delicies, he was transferred to the Center of Detention 1, held in the Early Fourth of the capital of the State.
It remained in the next 49 days when a second detention order was declared to him after the Department of the Public Ministry has expelled corruption and organized crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to the criminal center of Cadereyta for a million and half weight of the owners of Casino Red; but he was only a few hours in the median security prison center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the proceeding in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, a catch order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Penal Court of District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of application there were sufficient evidence confirmed to determine Jonas' responsibility, as regards the income of 1,5 million weights of the representatives of the game house in exchange to allow its functioning.
This Monday, the foundation of the Casino Red power, Victor Aldo García Gómez, was presented before judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the Master of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom during the following hours.
Pen· the formalities, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who a partner from the game house had been the one who had granted forgiveness, but the lawyer tried to refuse the name.
In accordance with the case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted forgiveness, and later no claim on the proceedings against it will be made available; no repayment of damages and no punishment will be asked for him.
According to the foundation of the basic power of the game house, at 15:50 a.m., the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Secretary of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to join Jonas who had been forgiven and his dossier would be classified.
He will also take him the order of immediate freedom that the judge has issued.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome provides the details of the airport in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people lost his life
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) reported that the results made evidence on the age in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people lost their lives, indicating that the helicopter has shooked directly against the ground in full integrity, without the pilot to try a forced attraction.
Pen ́ a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Secretary of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before the airline collection, the pilot found that climate conditions were appropriate to fly.
"The elements that indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the balls had contacted the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuslage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it satisfied the requirements necessary for transport of the staff.
Moreover, he said that research in the impact area does not report the appearance of parts in the ground.
"In a research, it was reported that there were no parts or components of the airport in another place, the impact had been presented in a manner.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and satisfied the requirements to transport them.
The ground had a set of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that a priority is to have the most rapidly possible results; but the investigation may dure a few months, it may even take a year.
At his turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the helicopter of the State presidential worked rapidly to cross, and that happened on a growing ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal function crossing at the time of the impact," he said.
The press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jacome, numbered six important elements in the investigation:
Full Visual:
According to the aircraft legislation, the flight has been implemented in accordance with the rules of the visual flight, which includes that the equipment must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned appropriate conditions for collection, and the furnish and as the aircraft went on to the limited area between DF and Mexico State, there were low-height nebulosity nebulosity boxes.
Selected Rows:
It is worth the fact that, due to nebulosity conditions, the team has searched for a lower and more visible area towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft on the concomitant radar, probably before the impact, have not been lost of control or change of flight trajectory.
Dispersion of airport residues in a reduced area:
The information available to this day allows us to assume that the impact has occurred on a right and side trajectory.
The model for the spread of aircraft residues allows the helicopter to be heated against the ground in terms of integrity.
No fire or explosion tracks have been detected:
There is always no track in the rest of the airport of a type of explosion or fire.
The last results of the investigation indicate that the airport had multiple contacts with the ground.
The landscapes found parts of the airport at a height of 9000 200 feet above the middle sea level, the ground had a pent that goes from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which it may have disarticulated during his travel.
The information provides elements that indicate that the helicopter may have multiple impacts on the ground.
Following a minute research in a larger area than the surrounded area around the aircraft, there were no splitted parts of the airport, which supported the precondition that the impact had occurred in conditions of integrity.
MSS announces a protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social security guides a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and youths; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Assurance (IMSS) announced that it led an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and youths, called the "Genetical Protocol for the Obesity of Children and Youths", which will allow the marks associated with the overweight.
In one case, the leader of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochimie of the Hotel of Specialities of the Medical National Centre of the 20th Section, Miguel ́z López, explained that there was a multidisciplinary team of doctors, farmers, nutritionists and social assistance.
This team is supported by experts and students of the third cycle of the National de Health Institute (INSP) and the Centre of Investigation and Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnique Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, you are invited to participate in the people with a right or not, to present to the IMSS sports units in the Valle of Mexico, where the evidence of minors every Sunday at 8:00 a.m.
He highlighted that the Protocol started in the Sportive Cuauhtemoc (Status de Mexico Poniente) and that since 8 October, the activity was carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sportive Unit (Status de Mexico Orient).
After reaching the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independence Unit (south of Federal District) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (Northern of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that e is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identifying the risk factors of children and young Mexico to prevent the emergency of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Day of Diabetes will be collected on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to meet three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years, with the supervision and monitoring of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their activities and their family heritage anticipations of their diseases to avoid risk factors that cause affections such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He detailed that the Sabbath will apply to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size, size circle), artificial pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (such to identify people associated with infantile obesity).
López reported that this investigation is the result of health professional concern for the weight alarm in the case of minors.
'The health investigations of 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years, in the case of boys, 77 per cent in obesity and 47 per cent of girls; in the case of the overweight, it was also observed a dramatic growth,' the IMSS specialist highlighted.
He indicated that the justification for the research of markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He informed that in the meantime, Mexico are 65 per cent of Indonesian heritage, 30 per cent of Europe and five per cent of African, and this is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the genetic of obesity is generally translated into the incapacity of bleeding the extent of energy that is consumed (calories), which is placed in the form of grass.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral assessment of children, which allows them to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of the shadow (acanthosis) colours on the hair and the pre-bras indicates the probability of suspecting metabolic changes and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors report it in writing to parents, to which each of the measures and changes in life must be made to prevent diseases.
López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic affections: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily activity, remain the most of the day sitting before the television and use transport means rather than to go on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric advantage, which is the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbon hydrates (tamals - meat-patted meat to maïs feeding in maïs -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of grass and proteins and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cases
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develop asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, independent of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pave was solved, it would no longer be necessary to fix approximately 200 thousand cases each rain season in the Valle of Mexico, advertising Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher of the Chime Faculty (FQ) of the UNAM, which ensured that if the building and maintenance of the bituminous pave was appropriate, cases could be reduced or even completely removed.
Pensone’s conference A view of cases, organized under the International Year of the Chemical Year, announced that the laborator who is responsible for developing asphaltes with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics of asfalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera considered that this type of ashletes could be used in places where climate is extremely warm, as certain cities from the north of the country, to improve the performance, and thus the training of cases.
He explained that the asphalte, the worst part of the oil, is a moles of hydrocarbons, moles with a worst molecular weight called assphaltene, and molecular moles with a low molecular weight called Malthene, which gives to the pave its vicolelassic behaviour.
The viskoeletical behaviour of asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, it becomes like a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and 50 degrees C it presents a closely solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes falling, `a't it.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changed during the day in accordance with environmental and temperature conditions, warned the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible pave, consisting of six woods of material, which the last three include asphalte.
Among the most surface beds is the asphalt box, formed by small stones in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the bed, signaling, is baconed in asphalte.
When the vehicles make up efforts, it allows forces to spread very well in the pave.
If we had a asphalte, these would be better spread, thinking of the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt box, he says, we are put a latest cow called a rolling lake, made in fine stone, that is, of the sand that is also thrown into asphalt.
As this is the box in contact with the vehicle wheels, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt box and provide adherence in the street.
As part of the pave that receives and distributes the effort, the rolling box also requires a suitable wheel and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, because these affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the ground moves, the water spreads inside the bed is difficult that this kind, which reduces all the cows of the pave and thus causes cases.
In the training process of a case, he says, the first to go is the rolling movies and only later is affected by the asphalt box, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be subjected to the first signs with appropriate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Research System explained that the charge of vehicles is another important factor for the training of cases, and thus the evaporation of each pave bottle must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent case training.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which already exist in other countries on the market and allow the cases to be easily and without use of high temperatures.
What missed the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not obtain the coronation of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives his title number 14 of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the coronary of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact of finding on the podium of winners, bringing the money coron and the band that believed it as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result received last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the coron and the sceptre, the department already sums 14 titles of Princesse and Melina is one of the women from Valle del Cauca, which have been found near the coron, but have been proclamed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Dimora Domingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garces Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garces Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question that many people ask is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defect of a great favorite that in each presentation she showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been chosen in vain Reine of the Police and Best Visage Jolie de Vogue, the titles received by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which brought the coron of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considers the key in the decision taken by the jury to design the First Princess is that she did not convince her answer to the question "?Who was the book that marked you and why? set by Martín Murillo Gómez, the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer of the Valle candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalizing, finally I believe that the book that marked my child is "The Little Prince," it's a very deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Chastiment", it is a universal book that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirowski, a Russian, a very beautiful book named "The Priority of Blood".
This answer was not a pleasure for the term "culturizing" and secondly not to explain exactly how each book quoted it was marked.
But at the end of the ceremonie Melina said she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and the wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a big book."
Among the hypotheses, there is that Valle was destroyed by the favoritism.
A journalist of Bogota suggested that as the preferred, ovationated and candidate who received all preliminary prices (Oster Gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "is awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the Queen and therefore it did not have been on the scene."
And this was noted in his first presentation in a bathroom maillot at the beach of Hilton and his two sticks of the coronation watch.
Even if she had been sure of herself at both screens, it was noted that she had no power and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "Como in home" of the NCNC Channel said that Melina has been designed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who receives most prices during the concurrence does not receive the coron of the Queen".
Moreover, Valle avoided the pressure at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not succeeded to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Concours de Beauté.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman involved in the social needs of his country.
"Only beauty is not sufficient for a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond it and focus on its social ability, that before the Concour begins, they are already involved in projects," she explains.
It is also hoped that Valle sinned by its deficiencies of his back and fibrose that was observed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory, because the jury chose it as the candidate 'Narity' with the healthier, good food and work responsible.
The Preparatory of Queen Jorge Hernán Orozco recognized that Melina had not the best body, which was better there, "but her problem of fibrosis on Abdomen, which actually was not too notory for me, left her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the Cromos magazine, considers that the error of the Valle candidate was the chirurgical interventions she had undertaken.
"The chirurgies are good, but Valle didn't know to do it.
Her body has never been herself and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Concours de Beauté for the first time, after the bain maillot switched up a cruel predict that was done last night, it was said that it was a little gift that Raymundo did to Melina to not give him the go ́ of the coron.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of government, not as a ruler, but as a princess, a position that gives him the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international concours by designation of the Concours National.
However, she will pass in the story as one of the Queens who, despite her exciting passage by Cartagena, did not get the coron.
This was the work of the person in Cali who identified Alfonso Cano's body
A Dactyloscope of Cali has passed through the story like the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers is crucial.
Last November, a dactyloscope from the CTI of Cali passed the history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chair of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", confronting its digital prints.
Seven dactyloscopists working in CTI's local offices, this week was the tour of Eliazar González ', a man of Puerto Tejada who worked for 21 years in the Judicial investigation area.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Choco's municipalities, where many times he had to pass more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the body was identified.
In 2000 he was transferred to the Valle capital and followed appropriate courses, he was specialised in dactyloscopie, which is the study of the breeding skin, which is powder and feet.
Pen Property week of operation against Alfonso Cano we had warned Eliazar to take with him clothes for at least three days.
Something very big attracted it.
Thursday night he went to Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodys and that one of them was the man who managed the older guerrilla of the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten digital prints of Guillermo León Sáenz (her true name).
But when he arrived with the team of investigation at the place of the body, he did not recognize it by his aspect, because this was very different from what he saw in the media.
He had no barb, he was embraced as a landscape of the area, without lamps and much more mad.
But the prints don't lie.
Compared by a galtonian loup, the encree, a reader and a lanter, Eliazar compared the digital prints of the body with the cards.
His eyes didn't miss him: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man originating in Puerto Tejada was the responsibility that confirmed the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, as yes, was the Supreme Chief of Farc.
At the search of the printing
For a Dactyloscope of Sijen de Cali, the president Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people didn't know our job.
Dactyloscopie is a precise science without error, which may be crucial in the crime resolution.
Rather than identifying bodys, dactyloscopests support the investigations for crimes such as flight and homicide and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their digital prints and search them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of flight he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in this place the flighter had pressed his hand to make a full-force coffre of birds and money.
"The walls are hard because they are not suitable surfaces to take a digital print, but in this case we could print the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in different flights," he remembers.
Printing can also separate or confirm suspeats in cases of homosexuality.
Recently, a dead man was found, with drink bottles around him.
By means of the investigation, a parent could be suspicious of the crime and actually a pressure on the bottom was coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the §, this is the place on the scene of crime.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "digital prints of objects with chemical or chemical reactions".
When they appear, a traveler or a band is used to deal with them.
Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of declinants, or to the National Civil Register.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without paper," indicates the CTI expert.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI TV programme.
As all that doesn't be gold, everything we touch is not strongly a pressure.
However, it can be used if it is achieved the necessary comparison.
"Independents" defend the authorities in New York
Hundreds of manifestants moved before Zuccotti place to camp there.
A large number of people accessed to the evacuation order and moved to a neighborhood park.
The integrants of the Occupe Wall Street movement defeated this Wednesday by the New York authorities trying to enter again, using a Judic order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated to the wood and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of manifestants moved before Zuccotti place, where they wanted to access through a Judician order that allows the "individual" to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement answered the evacuation by occupating a park more north of the city, where there were new detentions.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the place, we'll go to another place and we'll continue the fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sites and peaceful manifestations," said one of the "Occupe Wall Street", Mark Bray movement portfolio.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indigned" to the evacuation of their camp personally addressed by the Major of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed demonstrators to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the "Indignes" occupied a new park in the confluence of the Canal Street Centers and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which united New York and New Jersey, property of the Trinity Church.
At least for a hour they succeeded to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and stopped some manifestants, even if Bray could not confirm the concrete number, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists to which we had also passed the mines.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who were installed in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders was moved in a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene before the police.
In the meantime, the place Zuccotti - which is a private property center - remains closed by waiting for the collection of a Judicial audience scheduled by this Monday during which the evacuation quality of this morning is to be analysed.
Some demonstrants moved to that time and distributed copies of this Judicial order and even delivered it to the supervisory agents, which caused some small conflicts, indicated Bray, which indicated that some officials had struck the manifestants.
The Judicial order prohibited the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupe Wall Street or to apply legal laws after the start of employment or to prohibit demonstrators to access again to the park with tents or other properties they used before.
Mr. Bloomberg indicated before the press that because of this Judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and manifestants, however he warned that local laws did not allow them to install with tents and sacks to sleep.
The municipal adviser defended personally the evacuation carried out in the place of Zuccotti, a operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the manifestants were "doing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the place because it was "a place where people were not coming to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do bad to others," because "certain magazines had been threatened" and the residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning in the wheel was reproaching and demonstrating that Bloomberg fund is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of the American workers," the portfolio of the movement, which is the major of "no respecting the freedom of expression".
The responsibility for "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday with Community organizations and syndicates to remember the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Vierge Marie in a special television program of Noel
On the side of Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will go out to the television program "It's a > Peters Christmas" on 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a secure in "Baywatch", a lapin in "Playboy", a wife of rock Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model will be the Vierge Marie in a special program of Noel of the Canadian TV.
The private CTV TV channel has now announced that Anderson, by the side of the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be out of the "It's a ` Peters Christmas' TV program on 1 December, which will be interpreted by a very special Vierge Marie.
CTV has now distributed pictures of the television program in which Anderson, known also for the full diffusion on the Internet of a private pornography video in which she appeared with her husbands at that time, the battler of "Möttley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared famous as the Vierge Marie, supporting in a crowd that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently presented a part of the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appeared as Joseph.
Near Anderson and Peters, the special programme of Noel de CTV also presents the Canadian song Bublé, who at the end of March march march marched in Buenos Aires the argentin model Luisana Lopilato, which is not far from the conflicts.
Recently, Bublé called "pute" American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan returned after the earth's tremblement
The PIB increased 1,5% by the domestic consumption and ended the decreasing spirit of the beginning of March
Since March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, convalent still after the earthquake devastater who became nuclear crisis, the worst disaster of Nippons country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government have calculated the maternal losses of $30,000 million, which, despite the difficult global context, has been reduced.
After three trimestres of falls, data from the Internal Product Brut between July and September served to turn the page permanently: the PIB increased 1,5% compared to the previous trimester and 6% annually.
He recorded the second quarter - for Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the largest increase rythme since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the land trembling and the tsunami later.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1,1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of the estimated capital expenditure from January to March, the first time after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the true stimulant of Japanese economy is not based on the Chinese impulsion that invites to benefit from the crisis to console - or rebuild - infrastructures, use the carences for zero cross.
Japan was especially wakened through the development of the domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese PIB.
This variation increased by 1%, enhanced by the increase of the costs on vehicles, travels and entertainment activities.
The yen stickmate
Tokyo returned to the internal market when yen - the nippone currency - became one of the "values of SPH" chosen by investors who fled the debt crisis in the euro zone and the United States' previsional distress, a privilege that causes a part of the exporting companies' accounts.
With a stronger division, the products are lovers in the foreign, a serious reverse for a country with the health of the large groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their weak results between July and September.
The Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not decrease that markets continue their seats in the EU perifer countries.
"The risks must be followed, such as detection of certain foreign economys, the impact of Thailand's inundations and the fast yen appreciation," reported the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
And actually, the perspectives are not of all kinds of encouragement.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE) mentioned that most of the Member States had presented more economic rating signals in September.
The employer who predicts the points of inflexion of the world economy has underlined that the main powers are freed.
Because it was cut four decimal up to 100,4 points, compared to 100,8 points out.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is located at level 100, not less than eight decimal to 99.13 points.
Athenes Feed again the doubts
Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservator will not sign any written commitment
With the delayed device risk premiums and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to carry out the labyrinthe that leads to the outcome of the great crisis of the European debt.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenian transition Government is in place imposed by Brussels' requirements and the real conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
The new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, reported yesterday that there is no alternative for reforms and that the hundred days set out in his designation may be short to apply them, the leader of the New Democracy Conservator Party, Antonis Samaras, would ensure that it would not be able to support the new outermost measures in any case and repeated its need for new elections for the given date, the 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the sum of 26 October," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a trust vote for the new Exekutive.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officers and new measures against tax evacuation will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not deny doubts about his position: "We are committed to help the Government of transition, but we are not committed to anything more."
The conservative leader went a farer step in his pouls than the EU and the FMI, the agencies that have to deblock the 8.000 millions of Athens needed with urgent necessity, and he said that it would not approve any letter of implementation of the adjustments.
However, the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the entire Referendum of Papandreu, repeated yesterday that its need is firm: it will not blow the help if the new Government and leaders of the main Hellenian parties are not signed "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The password of the Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troyka would return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranch" of 8.000 million, even if there is no final date.
The Greeks still have much to do.
The Queen of Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "presentative" place of Spain in relation to this type of funds
Spain " has reached a worldwide place in the role of Microfinances".
The Queen Sophia recalled that the country became the second provider of the planet in the last two decades regarding this instrument of cooperation that "the essence" lives in the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humankind, based on confidence in human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V-e World Credit University of the Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that there is no doubt that this type of operations are " absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "in particular, in that it has aimed to reduce half the volume of people who live with incomes under a dollar per day, which is fixed by the "Poverty Seal".
Spain "continues to work" to increase the network of benefits "in all corners of the planet, and hold this task with "responsibility", reported the Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions of origin during the Sommet, which will be extended until Thursday, "will guarantee the creation of new capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main benefits of these loans.
We have "too many goals" and "We face many challenges".
The Summary of the Microcredit is considered not only as a forum of debate but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be impulsed.
Thus, the objective was that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that hundred million of these families are out of poverty level where they live now.
The impulsion in the design of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the road of the beginning a few years ago" by Muhammad Yunus highlighted the Queen Sophia as a "righteous act and due ability".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "wonderful idealist in the universal cause of fight against poverty", the work of which she knew from 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summary in Washington and other meetings such as those collected in the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in each meeting I could find a continuous development," explained Sa©esté, whose relationship with this project brought him the quality of the "Family Chief" gathered in Valladolid from the "Poor Banker".
Finally, the Queen of Sofia ended its intervention by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and search for solutions to promote the fight against poverty.
"Ethic implicit"
The Ministry of External Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the solidarity "is an ethnic imperative" for all democratic states.
In this regard, she expressed that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries at economic prosperity times, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believed that micro-credits have "a serious and strong policy dedicated to the erradication of poverty" and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow that to be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, the microcredit is " one of the main development cooperation lines".
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, approved "the success" to give "trust" to people "excluding all who close the door"; and the Major of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, wanted to be welcomed to those present in a city who "opened its intimidated doors of the solid spirit".
The CDU proposes to release the European President to the universal question
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, was deployed without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, the Channel, but also President of the Democratic Christian Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned for the programme, but it was imposed on the autumn, in particular to satisfy the soldiers who agree with the government's policy too laxist to the Greek today and perhaps tomorrow by the Italians.
The invitation to the Presidentship of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted at almost unilaterally.
On 1001 delegated, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes, on the basis of their interventions, Angela Merkel, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave any doubt.
The Master Ide of the Channel - and Motion - is in a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "new million employment deserves directly from the euro".
For the chance, "the time comes from a perceit in Europe."
This could be translated by changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, but it would also be able to focus on the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suspicion "to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the invitation adopted by the congress whose inspirer is chairly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is little that the 20th-Seventh agree quickly on this revolution: the Great-Bretagne is enemy there and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the jalon is placed.
Similarly, the delegates rejected an exciting majority the proposal to put the weight of each country to the Directorate of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which was obviously to strengthen the weight of Germany.
As a result of the climate inside her party, the chancelary multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she didn't even try to win her congress on the bottom of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the movement on Europe is a paragraph to the importance of "the French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not refer to France.
Except in cream.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, this was one of the most humiliating defects of the Napoleon Army.
What is the fraud of disease arrests?
Following allocations, the OMP and the Government launch the office on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Thursday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allocations, and to speak a talk about the theme - from 2007 - the fight against social frauds and assistant.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of the will of making economy in a rigorous context, but is not less proclaiming the axis of the presidential to the right campaign, the majority wants to address disease arrests.
Award for a budgetary economy purpose: the Government intends to impose private salaries a fourth day of duty before a labour decision.
Without a specific enterprise agreement, a salarie that falls sick would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that could be caused by anger, but that would allow 280 million euros to report, Les Echos.
And who would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic port: impose to the officers a day of unfair care in the case of work stop (they have not yet a time of care, against three days in the private).
While these issues are discussed, the majority also repeat the thematic of frauds, aiming this time for abuses related to work detentions.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will rebuild," he warned Xavier Bertrand to the RTL micro on Sunday 13 November.
As for other cases, announcement effects are somewhat disproportionated with the reality of frauds to work stops.
This has actually been subject to a constant and political monitoring since 2002, which have most often brought their fruits.
The French are not sicker than in Europe.
Let's wait for the national numbers.
According to the National Insurance Country (CNAM), more than 237 million euros were released in 2006.
According to the Health Economy Research and Documentation Institute, daily refunds represented 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with EUR 11.3 billion.
On this sum, 46 per cent concerned maternity and work accidents, and 54 per cent concerned disease detentions, or 6,2 billion euros.
So 2,5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, Franceses met in average 14,5 days of detention, against 17,8 in 2009, a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
A medium that hids some differences: another investigation, which was held in 2007 by the Monster.com carrier management site, would show that 75% of the 40 000 French soldiers asked said they had not taken any day of illness.
Another study, this time of the disease insurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of the disease arrests were under 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% below.
When comparing them to their European neighbors, the French salaries are no longer closer to work detentions.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that the global absent rate (for health reasons or not) was in France between 10 and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud to illness arrests is very small in the work of black.
With regard to fraud, she only gets a low wave.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has made systematic controls on disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, over 1.5 million controls, the CNAM observed that 13% of the 285.000 for short-term detentions were "injustified or too long" or 37.050 cases.
In the case of more than 45 days, systematicly controlled arrests, 11% of cases were "inadjusted or unjustified" of 1.2 million or 132.000.
In total, 169 000 cases "injustified" are, in addition to millions of salaries who have had a disease arrest.
A number that represents very little face, for example, the one of the work in black.
According to the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the question in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of lack of tax per year, or more than the total cost of daily refunds, and, therefore, more than the fraud to those last.
Papademos: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to reduce its economy.
That was what the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said on Monday 14 November before Parliament, and that the hundred days given to his government would not be sufficient to fulfil this task.
"To continue the effort to resurrect the economy, we need support for our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Government's leader, who declared his first public talk on the opening of the debate on the trust vote in the Monday Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the summary of the euro area on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, since the participation of the country in the euro area "is in play", he said.
As a result, Mr. Papademos proposed that the public deficit of the country would be reduced "approximately 9%" of the PIB at the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right of new outerential measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, provided its support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not engage in an additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of its party, New Democracy.
It agreed with the deficit and debt reduction goals, and the fight against deficiency but enemy to any political policy that would prevent economic recovery.
The European Commissioner of Economic and Monetary Affairs, O ́ Rehn, which predicted that the FMI and the EU would not deploy the loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties that would support the measures provided, Antonio Samaras replied that it was enough and that it would not sign anything under external pressure.
A expert committee has to analyze euthanisation and self-sufficiency.
Canadians live in the deadness of death, the report of the Royal Society of Canada
As regards paliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work in order to ensure better paliative care, and that is, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the dead.
Only 9% of the Canadians accept to talk to their doctor about the conditions they want and take provisions for this purpose.
It is one of the conclusions of a reporting of the Royal Society of Canada, which has participated in six experts relating to different areas, including ethics, rights and medicals.
This committee recommends the Government of the Code in order to enable assisted suicide and euthanase, when this choice is committed, with a competent patient to make such a decision.
Incoming game, experts cite a recent investigation of the United Intelligence Economy, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada was classified in 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people fear to overcome the subject of death."
Medicalisation or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to paliative care, report our experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians have to hold home, 68.6% of them end at the hospital.
In the country in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the dead in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of the assisted euthanase and suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions against the position of the Federal Government, which has already said that nothing would like to change the Code of Euthania and Suicide.
However, the experts, who have also been revised in all countries where these approaches are aligned or disqualified, have no evidence that this dealing leads to abuse in the application, which is the practice of euthanism or self-sufficiency assisted on non-responsible or non-responsible persons.
In contrast, Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, said in telecommunication yesterday, would find more cases of these disturbances precisely in countries where euthanation and self-sufficiency are not allocated.
"Euthanase is practiced in Canada, where it is illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians favorable to Euthania
Let us note that 85% of the Canadians have already been pronounced for euthanase because they believe that it would allow people in the end of their lives to allocate their soffrances, a investigation of Reid in 2010.
And 66% believe that the fact of rationalising euthanase will not have any effect to send the message that the life of older or handicaped people is less valuable.
As regards those who practiced the administered suicide, the investigations estimate 41% that they should not be followed.
With regard to maintenance or suspension of care in a patient, the situation is less difficult, the report authors say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Code ggeal that the concerns for which a validity is not valid.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to respect a life-based care, without fear of prosecutions.
As regards paliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work in order to ensure better paliative care, and that is, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of a palliative or terminal seat, already largely used in the Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered if it does not serve to reduce pain, as well as euthanation, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reservations on the conclusions of the report of the Royal Society Experts of Canada.
My Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has qualified of "extreme" the position of the signatory experts of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanation to the terminal phase diseases.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be fatigued of life and who had more than 18 years could ask for what it would help to selfish," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
My Deschamps also highlights that the authors of the report are putting the person's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social tissue of the society.
"In society, he says, there are balises and restrictions."
Margaret Somerville's health law specialist also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which it qualified of "manifest pro-euthanation".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly responsible for the report on the abuse of abus in some countries where euthanation and self-sufficiency are allocated, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad to leave the power
● Describes a "complot"
It is more isolated
Apartments of Bachar al-Assad have shown the places of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
The diplomatic pressures were intensified yesterday on Bachar al-Assad, which, with Russia's support, resisted them and declared a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of the Arabian Lieutenant, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against ­ while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of la ́e, adopted position for a department of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader who called President Bachar al-Assad to "seat the power" last night, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar had the interest of his country in heart, he should leave, but he should also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, neighboring country of labia, in an interview of the BBC.
For its part, the leader of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu discovered that Turkish mediation efforts were undertaken since the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime.
"They who are not in peace in the Middle East with their people and are not able to satisfy them will leave," he said, "who are not in peace with the Middle-Orients, and whose neighbors have a stronger line in Turkey.
The United States welcomed the "reforcement of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab Republic and of the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Ligue, countries like Turkey are adopting a more harder tonne" against the repression, Mark Toner, a portfolio of the State Department.
At that time, 16 citizens and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have lost in Deraa's region, South of the Lake, announced the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other citizens have lost "three exchanges and pilonnage to lower mitrales in Jobar" in the assied city of Homs, this NGO.
However, during a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem concluded that the country would "diminish the end of the crisis".
In addition, he reacted vitally to the decision of the Arab Ligue to suspend its travels, which constitutes him "a dangerous step".
The "n't flee", he said, "assuring that the complots of ordis against the failure."
Following its decision to suspend the deadline, the Arab Ligue now studies a " civil protection mechanism" and wants the sending of 500 members of Arab rights of person, media and military observers in the country.
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also said favorable to send the United Nations observators to help civilians protect the repression of the regime which is closed in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the Ligue is held in Rabba tomorrow to make the point on the implementation of the crisis output plan decided on 2 November and, in particular, predicting the retraction of the armed forces of the cities for the contest and freedom of the arrested manifestants.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergueï Lavrov, judged injustly yesterday the decision of the Arab Ligue, while China urged the Commission to implement the crisis outcome plan, while keeping on supporting any sanctions against.
Italy
Monti requests time for markets and sacrifices to Italy
The future leader of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, claimed a little time on the markets to form its team and implement a programme that will contain "offs" to recover the lost creditability in the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner was discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting the syndicates and the patronate today.
It should place a relatively restricted cabinet composed of external technocrates in Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, member of one of the many small Parliamentary groups involved in the entrepreneurs, after meeting the appointed Council President.
The President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, for its part, said to expect Mario Monti to ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be completed by Mr. Monti's presentation of a restrictive list of twelve ministers to the head of the State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the worst and obligatory markets yesterday, asking them of time.
In "democracy, there are precise times" to prepare a government and its programme, he highlighted, saying, "certainly, the markets will be patient and will understand."
Its designation by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern was repeated in particular after an unexpected fall of the industrial production in the euro area in September.
The named Prime Minister should be a team that is particularly technical, even if he stressed that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government must dure until 2013, date of the next islatives, has been considered.
According to the President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive the confidence of the Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti committed, once he entered into force, to work in the emergency and to the aim that Italy "revens protagonists" in Europe.
A portfolio of the European Commissioner O日 Rehn highlighted that "self with a new government, our Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome would not reach its budgetary balance goal in 2013 despite the plans of exertity adopted in recent months, requested, in particular, new rigorous measures.
The Italian pattern of the Italian patrons Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Monday, also insisted on the need to restore the economy, "for a country that does not have growth cannot respect the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monti, for its competence and its independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" that symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and another "Italia", and the editors.
The great unknown will be the long-term of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid previous elections, since Italy has to place here in April 2012 for 200 billion euros of State obligations.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a useful detonator with a nuclear weapons, stated a American NGO specialised in the atomic risk on Monday.
The International Science and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (AIEA) and other documents issued from this United Nations Agency to identify this researcher.
The AIEA was part of its "serious concerns" last week regarding the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, a large power in AIEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades since the 60s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural), and would have been involved in the production of synthetic diamants by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iran ambassade in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA refers to " strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "is helped by a foreign expert, who was not only well known to this technique but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during its career's importance in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin."
Anti-muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crime and crimes against Muslims have increased from nearly 50 per cent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violences have severely decreased or shortly progressed, and the FBI's statistics have been reported on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violences perpetrated against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49 per cent of the progression of 13 per cent of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent of crimes against Jewish and a global increase of 14 per cent of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased to 6 628 cases, including 47.3% motivated by race differences and 20% by religious differences, the FBI.
"When a decline in 2009, it is disturbed to see these crimes and crimes again," stressed the human rights organization first, "the anti-musulman violence is particularly significant," organized in an appealed organization.
"Human Rights First has long highlighted that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of crimes, must be considered as a serious violation of human rights," is one of the responsibles of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"American Government can and must make more to attack these disasters," he estimates that this could be a improvement of the police reports on "hate crimes".
"Owner crime" in the American federal law is an inheritance of the time of combating civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin, and now sexual attitude.
Twitter changes its platform and more in Facebook
The Microblogging Twitter site introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activities of those they follow, which makes his service a little more than Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allows you to follow more readable, directly follow the activity of the other "Twittos", the internautes who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favourite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula has been tested "on a small percentage of users in a aula" before it was distributed to the Monday network, the AFP indicated the Twitter portfolio, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known for his little instinct function, with some eotric terms (RT to restore a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) which makes the happiness of the starts, thus opens to a larger public with a more comparable management with the Facebook and Google+ large public networks.
On the network, users discussed "tweets" on the interest of this innovation.
"It's unusual, invasive, and it doesn't happen too much to Facebook," wrote @jimb123.
"The Activity functionality will help me better follow some of my Twitter flux elements," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
inscription of a "or" budgetary rule in the constitution
The Government of Great Social and Democratic Coalition/Christian Government to the power in Austria decided to enter into the constitution a "good" rule in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a sustainable degradation by the subsidiary notation agencies of Austria (trip A).
It is the social-democracy Channel Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the outcome of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian debt is 74.6%, largely above the maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but just below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was only decreased from one single crown, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros for more than every year," said Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Democratic Democracy of Foreign Affairs.
Austria therefore requests a summary in Brussels of the Member States of the euro area of last 26 October: the State and Government leaders had then claimed to encrypt this end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and return to the equality of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government approaches the "German Model", Germany who was the first European country to adopt such a "reglement".
Since 2017, the structural public deficit should be decreased by 0.75% of the brutal internal product (PIB) each year and, at the end of 2017, the structural public deficit of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of the PIB, while the regional States and the communes should submit balance budgets.
The goal is to make the debt under the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Future Yen
Noda threat of a new intervention on the market of changes
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, predicted on Monday that nippons authorities would continue to intervene on the market of changes if they should continue to go up.
"We will intervene as we have done the last time if we find a volatility" in the yen change rate, Mr. Noda explained at Sennat.
On March, the yen was not far from historical levels that moved Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yenes against dollars in order to decrease the value of nipton devise that was setting a new force record since 1945 faces the green billet.
However, the yen has been regularly remonted since, understood by investors buying it as a "value of refuge" in these uncertain global economic rating and crisis in Europe.
The dollar is passed on Thursday under the 77 yens, and the euro is descended under the symbolic bar of 105 yens, near the levels that have declined the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
This flamb of Nipone deviation night to the exports of the archive because it reduces the cost of Made products in Japan and reduces the value of the income from the foreign of the Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan fights to rebuild" since the seizure and tsunami of 11 March who destroyed the region of Tohoku (Noda) stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that the yen regeneration is not killed in the eye.
The third world economic power renewed the growth at the third trimester -1,5 per cent compared to the trimestre - for the first time in one year, through a rebound of exports and consumption of the catastrophe-bodies.
But the Prime Minister decided that the yen's experience was not "the Japan's economics".
The Ministry of Finance, Jun Azumi, has for its part called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), who opened a meeting of two days of its monetary policy Council, to take all the possible measures to afford yen.
But the assistant Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures" by hearing that no additional monetary surprise was to wait on Thursday.
At its last meeting end of October, the Emission Institute increased by 5.000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its bond purchases of the Tresor, which caused 55.000 billion yen (519 billion euros) to the amounts she dedicated to different financial tickets to enhance the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
the grid rate, the flanching Bourses
The risk of counterparty of the debt crisis is always the European indicators.
Despite the nomination of new Government leaders in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the fragilized countries' rates continue to continue their increase.
The European Bourses are always worried about the stability of the euro area, and the European Bourses are a little more in the negative territory on Thursday 15 November.
In Paris at 10:00 CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Francfort is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
" With the new pressures on the performance of the euro area loans in difficulty, the world-wide action markets continue to become part of their recent gains. "
"The investors, nervous, are only too conscious of the risk of counterfeit," explains Terry Pratt, institutional courtier at the IG Markets, quoted by the Re日s Agency.
The Tokyo Bourse was lower than 0.7 per cent, suffering the renewable fears of the market intervenants in relation to the ability of Europe to maintain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has raised the eyes on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a heavy currency until investors will have evidence that the situation is stabilised, "but Mitsushige Akino, managing funds in the Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This inquiry on the future of the euro area penalises the unique currency, which continues to be low on Tuesday.
The euro is developed at its lowest level since a month and a half.
On 10 hours, the European deviation is 1.3570 dollars, respectively 0.4%.
According to the courtiers, she recovered after the Partie of the Channel Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting on Monday, adopted an invitation, in particular, for a country in difficulty to get out of the euro area without as much to leave the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are more than 6%
The imprisonment rates of Italy and Spain remain very concerned.
This morning, the performance of the 10-year Italian obligations reaches 6,85%, the Spanish titles of the same maturity 6.2%.
These pressures on the interest rates of Southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of the interventors.
The leader of the future Italian Government Mario Monti claimed time on the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of decisions taken during the summ of the euro area on 27 October would be the " main task " of his government.
Spain is located in the market mirror line, while on Sunday isslative elections in the country.
The rate art ("spread") between the 10-year-old obligations of Germany and Spain reached a new higher history.
In the expectation of the euro area growth figures
Statistics, France has recorded an economic growth of 0.4% at the third trimester, or a little better than 0.3% expected, which has been brought by the consumption of households.
However, the Insee reviewed the number of the second trimester, with a recycling of 0.1% of the brute internal product (PIB) instead of a stagnation.
And it's actually the fourth who's worried about the most economics.
Germany, on its side, recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
A first estimation for the euro area is expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just observed the risk of a new receipt.
Energy policy:
the facts must take it on the dogs
If it is a subject that we cannot be treated from short term considerations or under emotional considerations, it is the energy policy.
The ability and the cost of election are directly affecting the purchase power and competitiveness of companies.
It is well that a electoral meeting is the opportunity to think of such injuries and the place that the nuclear holds there.
The debate will only benefit if it exploits the economic, social and environmental impacts of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demography evolution will lead to a double demand for election from here to 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is a vital element.
At the same time, the reeffect of fossil resources will need to continue to produce the continuous election, without forgetting the empire need for reducing emissions of gases to combat climate destruction, a disappeared subject from the Ethiopian debate.
Fukushima's age does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to refuse the nuclear.
This is not the case or the ecstasy, which submits to the need to find a replacement source that could be replaced, or from Switzerland, which simply means building only centrals of the last generation.
In contrast, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only them, follow their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to acquire a unit in their park by repairing the construction of a central construction after the Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contrary to speaking.
Berlin's choice will be translated by the reduction of the election price, an aggravated energy dependence by the increased gas resource, in particular from Russia, a number of CO2 emissions resulting from the gas and carbon building.
In a few months, the incidence of these harmful effects is already feeling.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
Europe's campaign, which is 30% of its election, is also one of the largest carbon and gas users in the fact of wind transmission; its CO2 emissions and the price of its election are 65% and 50% higher than the average European.
Instead, through the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors have a facture of choice more than 40% than the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, the French companies are beneficial to the least dearly Europe's election.
In this case, any significant reduction in the nuclear part would lead to a strong increase in the price of election, which would make the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of the purchase power.
A price that a large majority of Frances are paying, although they do not demonstrate a principle of opposition to this energy, the investigations show it.
Let us note that our country's energy policy has enabled to build a industrial branch of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 employment.
It is strongly exporting, it leads to a specialized SME galaxie on international markets and makes them very non-local employment creators.
If France had decided to get out of the nuclear, it would offer a lot of these SMEs by reducing as a damage skin to 6 billion euros annually of French nuclear equipment and services.
What electricist would order an EPR designed to work for seventy years when its manufacturer's decline would be planned?
In order to solve the energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no source of the production of wonderful election, not more than the diabetes.
The development by Areva of small CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions shows the complementarity of energy sources.
For the nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have a security Authority in France who exercises an intransistant and transparent control on existing centres as on the Flamanville Chantery.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, are residents of the same security.
In a half century, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
One, Trie Mile Island, has been intervened in normal exploitation conditions; it has remained without consequences of huma or environmental.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reacter and unforgiving human errors caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some forget that it resulted from two natural catastrophes of an unexpected wave that caused decades of thousands of people to die.
The nuclear industry will take the teachings of this accident, as it had done for the two.
The fruit of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the operators and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR provides a design that makes it able to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electorians wanting to build a central, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift offered to the concurrents of Areva and EDF by leaveing them the free way to deal with leadership in the incontourable nuclear development.
It is essential and important to seek the best energy bucket for our country, but it would be unresponsible to leave the emotion, dogmes and partial manworks to dominate a debat also determining for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is the immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The Immigration Policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles -incorporation of police, judges and administrative services undertaken to the number policy, compatibility of this policy with the auto-proclaimed status of "Music Rights Countries" of France.
Recently, it is the administrative archaelement of foreign students who have made the present, the Ministry of Interior ( Read Liberation of 23 May) who declare the past that France "not needs for foreign talents, macings and restaurant servers".
But it is only rarely analysed under the economic angle.
It is that there is a pretty wide consensus between left and right on this subject.
On the right hand, the ton was given by Jacques Chirac, which declared in 1976 that "900000 unemploymenters should not be a problem in a country that includes nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and at the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "not can accept the whole world's misfortune in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by the Poland floor hordes was divided on the left and right.
For both borders, immigrants are considered a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that it will be granted to immigrants.
In its programme, François Holland is a banality, which indicates that the development will allow our "the problem" to resolve.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electronic payment; but it is economically very costly.
As Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recalls in a recent book that synthesizes the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shape Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton & Press, 352 p.), there is a wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the flows on economic growth, salaries and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Resume anonymous immigration growth and night to employment.
The fears regarding the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are able to substitute themselves to national workers, especially the smallly qualified workers, with the pressure to be reduced on their salaries.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than replaced by national salaries, exercising the importance of employment employment sectors.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attain national salaries, and most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on salaries
Similarly, as a chirurgian will have difficulty to work in a country that knows anesthetism, these complementaries between national and migrant make the arrival of immigrants a positive effect on the salaries and the employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of the flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of the long-term real salaries.
And this does not take into account the fact that the variety of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrators are also net contributors of social systems, averagely by 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Work Organization, for example, believes that in Germany a 30-year-old immigrant will provide a clean (low-expenditure receipt) contribution of EUR 150000 to the average public budgets on its life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, to search for growth points missing "with teeth".
The tents concerned, using the dissuasion of immigrants, had the exact inverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still thinking of the European Democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has known the tragedies of the Greek War, the total, the Holocauste, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colons in Greece.
Some believed that it would suffice, so that the democracy would permanently triomphate his enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon, "the little" that he was there of an easy thinking.
The universal suffrage, to be the condition necessary for democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even be "oppression instrument" as the Republican etian Vacherot philosophe said sometimes.
No, democracy repeat much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, a organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis of Europe that we live is a economic crisis, but it is a crisis of political and democracy.
The Palinodie of the Greek Referendum will have a dual-reveler value in this regard: the need for a powerful return of the political, but also the feeling of its impossibleity, its incongruence.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the democratic fight lines have been moved today, and, for many of them, the Republican soldiers have no longer looked in the right direction.
We do not have anything to gain to require a succession of national references, organized by the needs and in a dispersed order.
A white-seing at the absolute European monarch or a footslot associated in the empty nationalist response: what choice for the citoyen!
No, we don't want covered, but a common, full-right exercise, series and continuity, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not know anywhere to stop the enumeration - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
This is the whole Europe who is addressed to market dictates and notation agencies, which is aware of its impunity and the deficiency of solidarity.
This is the whole Europe that is humbled on the international scene.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all Europe who loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to return to the people's sovereignty to the piloting of the European project.
Because it is, the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debt, free from markets and prepare the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will include decisions at European level that will not be able to be taken without a total democratic grip, unless we have been led to a disaster.
After long fighting this proposal of socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls on the European Economic Government.
Now.
But thinking without a stronger political and democratic integration, and v ́ such as citizens, would be a new foolish and a new impasse.
We must make a new stage of the European construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, the republicans had to be "fair".
Revolution in interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe on the economic level.
This will only be possible by building a more democratic Europe on political level, a real European population sovereignty.
To do Europe, let's make the Europeans.
Puzzle cards "uncontakt" are generalized
The world room of the puzzle map opens on Tuesday, near Paris, in a optimistic climate.
In 2011, there should be an increase of 11% of the worldwide microcarts (cart, phone with SIM card...), more than 6 billion units, the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most portor segment is the of the without contact that allows us to pay common transports or to regulate its purchases by simply approximating the map of a player.
This year, 460 million without contact cards should be sold throughout the world, against 320 million a year ago!
Their part should continue to progress in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent nearly 10% of the global market of the puzzle card (6.925 million cards).
Long-term train in Asia-Pacific region, Europe wins land for payment without contact.
Approximately 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75.000 payment terminals are accepting it.
In France, the starts are more modesty: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double mouths.
Carefour has thus issued 2,5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To pass to the higher speed, banks need now to equip their clients.
"The large French institutions have been committed to spread in the future systematicly to their clients of free contact cards," Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the way of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A few apparatus are currently equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) for transactions.
"They took the rest."
"But they should finally know a real essor next year."
"Our tables on sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the fronts.
The Agricultural Credit announced the launch of a test from December to June next to Caen.
The iPhone of about 200 clients and teachers will be equipped with an etui authorising payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also said yesterday to prepare the marketing of a offer that allows her customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
Du Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front is
Paris concerns the links between al-Qaida to Maghreb island and the Section Boko Haram.
The links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group to the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Section Boko Haram are confirmed.
Sunday, the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Alger now "acquired security".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of information services show that there is a good cooperation," he explained without further precision.
Paris → make a similar analysis.
The question on the rapt of two French in Nigeria in January last would have made the passports.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by neighbors of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Del日 of being killed next day as many of their ravisors during a operation of French special forces.
In the boxes of intervention, French and Nigerian researchers find several telephone puces belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axe
The analysis of past calls leads to several employees based on Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to the Radio France International (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested in researchers: a driving to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city from the north of Nigeria, Boko Haram's beach, and the other to a man who says near Aqmi and the sect.
"This is an advanced, but it is certainly necessary to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"It's possible."
"We know since years that the Sect benefits from external financial and intellectual support and that it is more active," says Kunle Amuwo, a nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been more evident in the development and talks of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now include the recovery of kamikazes or explosive engines more complex and the same factor as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, thus pressed Abuja to take into account the problems of Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a community of worthless irregularities.
Quick success
Funded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and imanalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "West Education is a sin" - is the establishment of a islamic emirate in the north muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, it knows a quick success.
It is political and requires a strict respect for the charia while its soldiers commit the fight against the central government.
These are the last mention of the churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram soldiers are particularly active, multiplying the attacks against the Commissioners.

The world’s public candidates at the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are simplified and ignorant.
A American infirmity by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple, even simple ideas?
By listening to the Republican presidential candidates, electors could believe it.
Since a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have multiplied tonitrous statements and recurses on foreign policy, traditionally a strong revolutionary point.
On China, on Iran, on Israel's assistance, the slogans - often unused - were.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the course of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to travel Chinas before the WHO and to put them "for the manipulation of their currency", a portfolio theme in a America exposed by all its industry to Asia.
As soon as this must involve the starting of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in Obama and only candidate to have sophisticated foreign policy visions, failed to interfere with an attitude that "flate" emotions.
He called a muscle but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depths of the surveys, remains inappropriate.
To Reagan Image
Romney also promised military flags on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran, he's fanfaroning."
"If Obama is real, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to acquire military assistance to Israel, and Obama would fail to deal with its obligations against this partner.
Herman Cain, second candidate the best placed, shows him a worrying ignorance of the documents.
Recently, he called to oppose the Chinese military threat because Pékin "sought to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has the military atom since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants fights against Iran, said ready to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cards.
Cain, Perry, and the candidate Michele Bachmann, are also preconceived to torture against terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009.
We are far from the republic candidate of 2008, John McCain, a weight in foreign policy.
The opposers of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he gained the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in the area of anti terrorism.
They insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the past too precipient of the "boys" of Iraq, on its territory in Libya, thus holding him a low label.
But the attack is not so easy.
Instead, the population considers the national security balance of Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it has lost military interventions that lead to discharge.
And by argumenting that we need to rebuild America economically to resume its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
North Stream, new Russian Gas entry gate in Europe
The North Stream Gasoduc, which directly linked the Western Europe to Russia by covering the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gaseous gender, wanted to celebrate the event with eclate.
More than 500 guests whose four heads of State and Government have participated on the Baltic borders, between orchestra and buffet final, in the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gasoduc, which links directly under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Similarly, the German Channel Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his approval of the Netherlands Mark Rutte returned to the flying of the valve commanding the input of Russian gas in the West-European network.
With this new gas, 27.5 billion cubes of additional Russian gas gases will come each year by a first tube of 1 224 km connecting the region of Saint-Petersbourg in Mecklembourg-Pomérania.
A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, allowing the total of 55 billion cubs of gas, or the equivalent of all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third on the same park is already stated.
For Gazprom, the end in time and time of this big song has victory air.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will actually allow direct gases to be delivered in Germany, avoiding any earthquake by a third country (Pologne or Ukraine).
On the other hand, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to put on Russia by threatening him to close access to the Western European markets.
At the strongest debate, Varsovie had not been forced to compare North Stream to a "new German-Soviet Pacte", in relation to the alliance between Hitler and Staline to occupy Poland in 1939.
This is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support to this Russian project, has gained greater security of its provisions.
But it is at the price of a deficiency of energy Europe, since the project has made a break between East Europeans and Western.
Russia, in five years of age, triomphed its vision of a direct covenant between Russia and the rich ODA, highly gas consumers, and their gears are declined.
"This gasoduc is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new art that reads us in organic way," he confirmed François Fillon by invoking this gas, demonstrating how political and economic gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles shown by Gazprom leaders, present in Lubmin, at the point of gas array.
The building of this gas is also a technical exploit.
The submarine tube is in beton steel to protect it against the borders of the ships.
It remains at the bottom of the sea, at a middle of 200 m.
To build it, mine fields from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"A hundred must have been removed or destroyed by caution, " indicates Jens M日er, the portfolio of the North Stream Society.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect fauna and flower.
The tube is a long metal serpent, heavy like 242 tours Eiffel, that nothing interruptes over all its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was scheduled at the width of Sweden, but the responsibles of the project rejected it while the Swedish were unnecessary to see a Russian state company to be permanently established at the width of their coasts.
"In the case of avarian, we stop the transition of gas in less than one minute," says Jens Mämer.
In the case of flexibility, the gas contained in the gas is therefore escape in the air.
But this case is deemed little by the manufacturers who have planned the sorrows to know a fugitive every 100 000 years.
The monitoring of the status of the gas is provided by a submarine robot, which is carried out by a ship, for external observation, and by an apparatus within the gasoduc.
From the form of a cigarette, it is introduced within the tube, width of a meter of diameter, and it is moved by the gas.
In the aircraft, after three full days of travel at 3 metres a second speed, it provides precise information on the potential deformations of metal.
The gasoduc was designed to work for fifty years without having to exceed the minimum repair.
Gas is simply guaranteed by pressure.
It's 200 bars at the past, and 100 to the arage.
Five companies have their forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the parts.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies created a common company called North Stream, loaded to build and operate gas.
She has her seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the tax is especially favorable.
Gazprom then praised this company for twenty renewable years the total gas transport capacity.
" Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever quantity of actually transported gases," says Jens Mämer.
The financing of gas building was 30% of the shareholders and 70% of the loans.
The total cost of travels should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment was 240 million.
But the minority actors are sure to return to their costs, because only Gazprom’s risk is only.
The gastrointestinal gasoduc of the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sablonenal literal plant of pins.
Valves, height of 4,5 metres, form the gas output gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and the specificity of the gas that comes before it is transferred into the German gases.
Since Monday, this terminal has received a million cubes of Russian gas at each hour.
In full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a mark book.
Created a fifty years ago by a Italian company, Moleskine wants to repeat the go of the writer.
He has a perfume of aventuries, last hours to write to the light of a bug.
The Moleskine book is easily performable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its faith of a cut white color, as older in time.
However, the Moleskine book as we know today is born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo company, based on Milan, decides at the time to launch a design but separate notes book.
Maria Sebregondi, then consulting for the company, is charged by the launch of the new product.
The book is inspired of an ancient production technology, the skin mole (food powder) which draws a vernis cotton used to cover bankettes, for example.
This type of book was very taken by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has made the go of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the former artists, until the 20th century, " , rais Maria Sebregondi, became responsible for the mark at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
During 2006 to 2010, wins increased by 26% to be 12.7 million schooled.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3.000 books were designed.
Molequina exceeds the Italian borders and exports into 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the book of notes seduces both businessman and students and professionals.
In the picture of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolites, opens of mind and cultivated.
The Italian small company, which had 12 employees at its beginning, has almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its books in the books, from the Fnac to the small town-by-butiks, and has found her identity.
"We followed the air of the time and this new need of writing, despite the e-mail e-mail e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanys the development of Moleskin: recently, the mark has launched an exhibition " Return " where texts or artists expose their own book.
In aula, she also launched a leopard cover, at the occasion of the Locarno film Festival.
Professor of his success and this cultural aura, Moleskine suggested to diversify its products: sacs, agenda, computer boxes... The mark declines over a whole range of supports.
Successful: In 2006, Modo Modo was buyed by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Syntegra Capital, writeing a new page in the Moleskine history.
Why is the rate of unemployment of hard workers remaining so high?
Approximately 19% of handicaped people are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of the handicappeds is open today.
Despite a voluntary policy established in 2005, the rate of unemployment of handicaped people is two times higher than the average: 19%, against 9% for the population.
Decouraging?
"No, it highlights E日 Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt, the one who organizes the week for the employment of the handicappeds."
" The progress made since fifty years is significant. "
At that time, the rate of unemployment was not two but three times higher.
" However, it remains great to do."
It is important to say that for handless unemployed people, the obstacles remain much before accessing employment.
Instead, they are age: 37% are more than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a less high level of qualification: 80% do not have it and 2,3 million students of higher education are only handicaped.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very extended: 53% for handicaps, against 38% in average.
Shortly, so many criteria that comply uniformly with the return to employment and which " constitute the node of the problem ", Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, created in 1992 to help companies recruit hard workers.
This is for the targets.
Remember the non-dit, the mentalities that develop, certain, but too lately.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrare for the City indicated that the questioned managers have " a low level of knowledge of the handicap " with a " overrepresentation of people in ruling, mental or intellectual deficiencies ".
Results, private companies of more than 20 salaries are still far from reaching the employment objective of 6% of employed employees, set out in a ... 1987 law.
The latest numbers in 2008, which are 2,6%.
"We are now around 3%," states Pierre Blaová, Director-General of Agefiph, the charge of collecting the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The evidence: the number of " taxed" institutions, as well as the payment amounts, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, and 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, which increased contributions, has made a strong pressure on enterprises," explains Pierre Bla. "
"But this improvement also translates a true conscience, especially in the large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of 20 to 49 salaries are employed against 82 per cent of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Free you"
Before meeting the Bleus Thursday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens didn't hide the pleasure that they were looking for this friendly match.
We're not going to write that there was a consciousness between them, but the image is symbolic.
Session at coast on the strategy of the State of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have done peace and good.
Five months after his appeal to Turkey, the Belgian elector only needs to be aware of it.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go forward," he assured Lillois's side.
As regards the contrast between its performances in club and choice, "it's a whole, if it's justified."
"A Lille, I'm there all the year, which isn't the case with the eclipse."
"I need to take my marks."
Measured against Romania Friday night for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis finally "briller".
However, without obscuring the meaning of "pleasing".
The Bleus has encouraged them since the age of 7 years and the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supporting," he said.
In fact, this involves further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
As in the face, " there is Matthew (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he says.
"We crossed all the time."
"People to play against them, it's only happiness!"
Avec bonhomie, Leekens has for her part called "verbalty".
"Fetted" of "a gala match".
"Fetted" also to find - in the quality of "voisin" - that France is "a very high-level team" a little more than one year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Bla's made a work of tonnerre," he enthusiased.
While the ecstasy is missing the next Euro, the technician would be well shared by the airport with the Blue Direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little ones become big," he highlighted.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to take account of this during the next matches." He's against France included.
Portuguese very trusting
The Portuguese of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimists to return to Bosnia (22:00), this Wednesday in Lisbon.
At the same time, the two teams had missed reality.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, in particular, a happy country."
Paulo Bento has already been seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that Selecçao, whose mannets is since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and a opponent, Bosnia, to buy.
Since the match was going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seemed clear that the games were not done.
Portugal dominated the party for more than one hour, certain, but it was unable to mark this aim so precious, which would have rejected it.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk because we've not marked a goal outside."
But with them, in their great stage of Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, before a public who should be there so bullying, even if the part is obviously announced " very severe," said a optimist but lucid Bento.
"We're waiting for a very tired match, but we're actually convinced that we can take the over, " said the Portuguese trainer of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50 per cent of chances to be in the Euro 2012," even relatively related to Carlos Queiroz' follower.
The new Friday reported in Bosnia commits the Portuguese to mark and win.
A novel can suffice to the Bosnians, which also needs to mark.
"It's a good result, however, that brings a certain risk because we have not marked a target outside, "remember Bento.
"We will play against a team with many technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he said.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to not " give them the time to think. "
A good idea, in the condition of being real, this time.
