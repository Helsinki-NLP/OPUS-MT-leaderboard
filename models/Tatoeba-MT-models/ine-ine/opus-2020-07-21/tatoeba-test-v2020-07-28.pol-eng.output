I'm not gonna tolerate that.
What do you hope to buy?
It's stupid to read that magazine.
I heard you had a beautiful voice.
I just don't know what to say.
I read the letter.
Tom did it for you.
I don't know if it's gonna help or not.

When I saw it, my breath was cut off.
She smiled.
I could do it better.

I know you're mixed.
Take the wall's wall.
We're gonna have to pull in this room.
He's talking about us.
