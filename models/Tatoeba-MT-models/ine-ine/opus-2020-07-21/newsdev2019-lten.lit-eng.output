Road with the Alster "Lambretta" club
The Lambretta motors were unchanged for the 7th decade culture.
The group of Italian engineers tried to exhaust the spirit of those times.
After 70 years after the first Alster "Lambretta" club was built, this weekend in Ferman's surroundings gathered about 100 motorollers from the United Kingdom and Ireland.
One of the first two members of the Club, Chris Wilson, in 1966, reached the first Lambretta for about 40 £.
"My motor was only a vehicle, but I knew that I could use it otherwise.
That was such a sport.
I haven't entered into mode culture, and now I have to be older," he said.
"He was too pig and much confidence, you could have purchased it for a available price, and has been able to do anything more than just to move from point A to point B."
He participated in the Lambretta separate starting tables of the Mino Island TT.
The first Alster 'Lambretta' club was created at the beginning of the 8th decade and reordered 12 years ago.
“Apart from 1971, motors and other forms of transport were at least less dominant people, and, in addition, the clubs were totally vulnerable to violence, so I thought, “Viskis, that's the end,” said Chris.
"Thereafter sometimes there was an interest and, like, it's growing."
Philip Steele's is the Alster "Lambretta" club, who has now 97 members, a secretary responsible for members.
“All motives are different.
Some members have affected the culture of modes, since they have almost all started from it.
Others are enthusiasts or hands – you will find all people.
There are also those who are just interested in.
A lot of motorolers to be modified, so there are no two equals.
It can not change motor and quietly carry 35 or 40 miles per hour, adjusted to the fearful Italian roads, but some members have improved it.
Some well modified motors have to reach up to 100 miles per hour."
In the weekend, some motorists were adjusted in the steam.
And although northern Ireland airports are not always like the "Lambretta" parent of Italy, this time the sun was on the roadway of the Ferman.
Ruth Davidson asked the question of the town silence "Brexito"
Ruth Davidson requested his colleagues 'time' for the Ministry of the President to agree on Brexito.
Scotland's head stated that in two years from the EU reference, the time was expired for negotiations.
She also considers her opinion after the words of Boris Johnson about the premium plan he called "insensitive and absolutely absurd".
She claimed to BBC "Sunday Politics Scotland" that it was time to support the Minister's President.
She said in Birming, “In the last two years, we had time for discussions.
The former Secretary of Foreign Affairs was responsible in one of the best cabinets country and the large part of the current plan, which was already recognised in November of the previous year.
The conservators now need to support the Minister's President, allow her to complete the negotiation and help to implement plans in the country.
I think the silence period would be very useful."
Their comments followed the enormous criticism in the Braxito debate, which was not the first time being Secretary for Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson.
By giving interviews to the BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later believed in the "Brexit" and that its cabinet plan could provide a favorable free trade negotiation with the European Union.
Mr. Davidson also stated that by participating in other farms, it would be promised to prevent the second reference to Scotland on independence, since “the provisions of 2014 were promised that this event would be the only one of them.”
She asked about the potential repeated reference to Brexit, and she said, "If we speak about the history of Scotland, I do not have any effect that we cannot repeat the reference if you are nationalists and the results do not have you.
I would be more important if I would say that I could create another reference to Brexito because I had hoped for another result.

Christine'a Blasey Ford's friend confirmed a declaration on sexual consommation, which includes Brettas Kavanaugh's
Lelanda Keyser, a friend of Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford in the Mediterranean, accused a candidate to the Supreme Court of the Bretagne Kavanaugh, when they were in the middle school, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that although it is not at home in the evening home that could be done, but believed in Ford's statement.
Keyser has previously announced the statement that he doesn't remember the dinner referred to or even knows whether Kavanaugh had agreed.
On the fourth day before the Court Committee, Kavanaugh often mentioned the Keyser statement as a proof of integrity, but she did not refer to Keyser's statement that she believed in Ford's words.
The President Trumpa noted the FTB on five days to conduct an investigation on a week when the Senator of the Republican Jeff Flake and other senators asked to give time to the investigation and to take the whole vote of Senato on Kavanaugh’o.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to his lawyer committee, and we said that he wanted to "come to contribute to the additional FTB investigation" on Kavanaugh.
“But, as my customer already explained, she does not know the judge Kavanaugh’o and doesn’t take care of the dinner or collection, he would have been with or without Dr. Ford”, states the lawyer of the avocate Keyser Howardo Walsho.
There is further explained that Keyser has “not rejected Dr. Ford's story and said to the pressure that you believe Dr. Ford's witnessing”.
“Instead, the most readable and unchanged truth is that it cannot be approved because it does not refer to the fact that it has been said.”
The friend of Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, as a result of the injury, also contributed to the FTB investigation.
Injustifying Chicago's lives tells us about life with a corrupt policeman and his guest
The main prosecutor of Ilinoyus tried to replace the history of the police of Chicago after a dark period.
It is believed that an unfair policeman has used unfair social residences and has increased many people.
Until now, 42 persons are injusticed.
Ida B. Wells has now remained a white box in the project for social housing, and they have lived before over the decades of their horse, unfortunately using the Chicago police officers.
Their leader, Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The lives accused him and his tactical condition of property, the claim of police reports and claims.
Willie's Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those judged who have yet judged Kim Foxx's general prosecutor.
“If you don't talk to him, you'll be done bad.
You were his enemy.
You stopped doing and profiting him," Cleon Glorer said about Watts.
“I was very afraid.
I wanted to escape from that area,
But I had nowhere to go," said Willie's Martin.
The Ethics Chapter of Foxxx shall be reviewed by 30 to 40 cases related to Watts.
Ida B. Wells, a resident in the social residence of Landon Allen, said that many people decided not to follow Watts.
“D’ Whoever hasn’t followed,” he said.
"But that was not important."
According to another ex-resident Baker, no one believed in the words of the residents about the official responsibilities of the sergeant.
“He has his own hands.
Who will believe us?"
She said Baker.
Joshua Tepfer, who works at the Chicago University of Justice, says that no one has believed in them until now.
"The investigation was deceived because these people did not show them the importance and no importance, because they were the neighbors who lived in the social village, so they were thinking they were even wronged," said Tepher.
“Sirge Watts sits in prison for the trial to carry out FTB information for 22 months.
Marteza Wise was also assigned to the prison for Watts' thanks.
I was just born.
For four years, I couldn't be with him.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to get a contact with him again," said Wise.
“I lost four years without the need.”
72-year-old "Fidelity" believes in the success of blocks, reality of the reality and decoration of the intellectual success
The potential of the "Fidelity" blocks was noted until 2018 when all corporations began to speak about this.
The Director-General Abby Johnson manager for investments in encryption is the most dangerous and unrelevant property class of last year.
"Before a few years ago, I and other elderly hands were just a smile of what is happening, especially in the bitcoin market," said Johnson.
We started to become and realize that we need to understand it.
Smalsome urged to start "cost" bitchoin in New Hampshire Share when this encrypted price was about $180.
The price was nearly $20,000 in December last year, and Johnson said, "We noticed that the prices we had started to be injured, even though we never believed that."
She didn't indicate how much bitchoin 'scase' or how much the "Fidelity" was involved.
The "Fidelity" workers are clearly in these cases.
Clubs for workers called "Bit and blocks", organizing seminars and meetings with specialists, now have nearly 2 600 members.
The company agreed with the Coinbase, which granted the Fidelity clients to verify the encrypted leaves using the Fidelity mobile software.
In 2015, the funds will be invested in bicycles.
In Johnson’s statement, the company rejected the majority of other possible methods of use of bitcoin or at least refused them shortly.
We're trying to watch the market.
As long as Katie Chase, the master of the "Fidelity"'s strategy, and the incubator of the blocks, which is part of the FCAT, looks for ways to use the public and business boards of blocks.
Chase was not able to comment on specific projects, but she discovered that it had been a major interest in many clients, partners and employees.
“The visit is still very new.
If you invoke information, you will understand that you are still trying to find concept evidence," said Chase.
We've tried to adapt blocks to various situations, and we've learned much, but there's not yet such progress to resolve such problems."
The group, in its statement, has more attention to trying to understand the nature of these emergencys.
They are trying to understand how to calculate physical things, →, min creatures, greenhouse, or to use blocks in the supply chain.
"Whatever this is not a focusing centre, I think it'll finally be anxious," said Chase.
"Fidelity" will be ready."
As an example, she pointed out the Pebble magazine, which was completely insufficient by trade standards, but finally purchased the Fidelity.
Their group creates a programmer for a wise time, which has been stopped after three years, collecting millions through the Kickstarter co-financing project.
The market appears to be "e Watch", "Fidelity" was prepared.
She quickly adjusted the program for Peebble to the new "e" product.
"We were not fully sure that Pebble's time would be over, but we wanted to be ready if people wanted the smart hours," she said.
"We bought knowledge and were ready when the smart hours were released to the mass market."

Moreover, he smoked your partner, who tried to go into the second height, and fell out of the stone.
On five days, when the judge decided Ford to catch for three years and four months, he said: “I hope you had two teachings.
First, David Oldhamo is not needed, the second is better not to be with the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one dance less than before and you have a dog.
It's still a little damage."

Mr. Oldham told the King Court of Liverpool to be sent when on 5 April, approximately 19:00 a.m.
John said: “Mr. Oldham, who is a rich man, went courageously out of the house and preached to the guilty who was going to him.
When he was afraid of his security, he smoked him in his face, so he was cut off and cut off his teeth.
Then the other inflammation was buried from the stone in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctly dressed him into his face."
Mr. Jones, the companion took a wooden board and tried to drive Mr. Oldham, and Ford said, "Call him, he killed my teeth."

Bulgaria issued 80 million £ of European payers' money to restore
Bulgaria has issued 80 million £ of European payment funds to the remote restaurant of old pillars, which now seem to be set out from “surry and carton”.
The Balkan country issued 80 million £ from the European Regional Development Fund.
Return back to the previous increase, restoration grew up.
The country of Krakra has promised the local government of the areas of the firm to transfer uncertain works.
The Bulgarian government has granted ten millions of EU to the remote middle-term restaurant.
The Balkan country issued 80 million £ from the European Regional Development Fund for the restoration of an older staff and assets, but in order to return their earlier growth, the consciousness of building works.
Relicts after the progressive restructuring seem to be made from “sure and carton”, so there are no attractive tourists.
For example, the mentioners assumed that the middle-term force of Krakra and the Roman Fort Trayanovi Vrata at Ihtimano was restructured by the use of a polymeric beton, often used for the greenhouse.
The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government agreed privately that it was necessary to learn from this failure.
“The force is a reverse state”, said the staff and mentioned Stella Duleva about Trayani Vrata.
She has endured 16 centuries, and now it's overwhelmed."
Such reactions have been thrown after the Krakra Fort Restoration in Pernik, thus the local government promised an adjusted part in 2019.
The force of the transnictor is called “fill from the carton” because of unexpected changes.
Bizantia Yailata Fort was produced “suring force” because it was restored from glassed white blocks that did not affect airconditions.
These unfortunate efforts are coherent with new doubts about how the European Union uses development funds.

In the case of MG Baltic, the complaints consulted Gabriel Landsberg
The Court's meeting was initiated by a conference (recurrence of November 2015) between the former Vice-President of MG Baltic, Raimondo Kurlianski, and the former "employment" of Vitauto Gapshi.
When listening to the entry, I am hard to regularly understand what the person who is currently charged with accusations is about.
In fact, it is heard that Mr. Kurlianski and Mr. Gapshis speak about the military festival, a few times calling on the name of the current Conservative Guide of Gabriel Landsberg, but what usually speaks is difficult to understand.
Approvals also for physical and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, there are three legal and five physical persons: work and Liberal consensus partys, the Concern of MG Baltic, former liberal and "worker" leaders E. Masiuli, Vytuut Gapshi, former parliamentary to Mr. Gustaini, Seimo nanjii to Mr Steponaviči and the former Vice-President of MG Baltic to Mr. Kurlianski.
Appeals to the work party on the impact of the interaction and trade, Liberal conviction involves trade, trade impact and misuse, and MG Baltic includes the papering and trade of parties.
The representatives agreed that the politics adopted or consulted the difference with the Vice-President of MG Baltic, Mr Kurlianski, and later offered or supported the initiatives in Seime and in other institutions.
The former President of the Liberal Consensus E. Masiulis is aware of the impact of trade, disturbation and irregularity, which has been submitted to the Vice-President of this party to Mr. Steponavici for the misuse of the former town of Vilnia's Council by Mr. Gustaini - a warrior.
Mr. Gapšji includes the effect of trade and trade, Mr. Kurlianskis - on the impact of papering and trade.
Answer: What must be able to take place in the second time of the President's elections?
In the question of the second submissions, four candidates were included at the top of the rates - the economicist Gitan Nausseda, a candidate from the Minister Saulius Skvernelis and two parents of the Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) who attended in the first breast-feeding party - Seimod Member of Ingrida Shimonyte and diplomat Vigauda Ushack.
In fact, Wednesday, the TS-LKD support was given to I. Simonyte, and Mr. Ushack was removed from the warfare.
As shown by the data, if the ships were at the last time, the second president would welcome Mr. Naused, but the "Wilmorus" leader, the sociolog Vês Gaidys said that it was too early to make conclusions.
"Separate (of other - DELFI) Nausea, but it is very important to know whether the party is speaking or about people, which is dynamic.
This was the duplicate of Simonite from one study to another, and Naussed was a stopped growth, even the reduction of Ushack was.
"The growth is very important to you," says the sociologist.
In addition, considering the results of the question, it is evident that there is no percent of people who are not yet aware of what they vote or think of not to be income.
If I. Simonyte and Mr. Skvernelis were in the second of the president's adoptions, the fight would be imprisoned - for the I. Simonitt would vote 32.7 per cent, for S. Skverne · 30.9 per cent.
In fact, even 36.4 per cent of the people replied that they would not vote for any of the candidates, or did not know for whom they would vote or not to vote.
Sociologist V. Hoody again highlighted that until we see a full picture, all candidates that would apply to the less successful Lithuania electorate.
"If we see the last year's birth, there are many parties in Lithuania where their candidates are?
For example, where was the social democratian candidate? 30 years was the candidate, right now?
When he arrives, he will see how he's going to face with other candidates.
So the Lithuanian side, which is less successful than what is less reflected," said Mr. Gaidys.
Politologist of the International Relations and Policy Institute of the University of Vilniaus (VU TSPMI) says that until all three candidates have been concluded very early, it seems likely to be sure that all three candidates who have rejected the battle of Mr. Ushack.
"I can tell from my experience that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference of 5 percent points does not really show any benefit of any candidate.
The only thing I could see that Nauseda would look good against Ushack... back in mind if it would come to vote for those people.
It also seems good, but we are now obools and bullves, because, for example, Nausseda has already announced that he is participating, Skvernel has not been published.
Moreover, the question has been made before the primary conservatory recovery, as it would appear after them?", says the politologist.
Tell him, Mr. Nausseda has a little plush, but when all candidates are already visited, he can be examined.
"The situation is adequately similar.
Nausea, Skvernell, Simony is the results of the surroundings.
I would like to recall that Roland Paks had 5 per cent support for voting for it, and then welcomed the adoptions.
"It can't be done any prognoses," said Mr. Jastramski.
DelFI recalls that the candidates have already visited the economicist Mr. Nausseda, Seimom member I. Simonyta, philosopher Arvyda Juozaitis, economy, Seimom member Aushra Maldeikiena, member of the Liberal Consciousness Peter Austrevicus, Seim member Naglis Putrekis and member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran charges Israel by trying to make a cybernate attack

He was mentioned in 2010 as a virus "Stuxnet" attack which made damage for Iran nuclear objects.
It seems that this harmful program is to cause Israel and the United States.
"A part of our technical orders' wake, they stayed in empty hands.
We will continue to speak on this opposite action in international forums," Mr. A. Yehoomi stressed.
Minister's vice-president Hamida Fattahi said that the Technical Command will have a lot of trials to demand their systems, but the people were "increasingly opened".
The "Impuls" man's health club made bad, renewing it didn't
The accident occurred about 10.40 p.m.
Baseine hairman (born in 1945) made it bad, and he was stuck under water.
The man was quickly removed from water, but he was already without consciousness.
It was trying to get him.
Soon, when the doctor had recovered quickly help, he was still trying to reject him, but the salvation of life was not overwhelmed.
He died in a quick aid in the car to the ligon.
This failure is commented by the "Impuls" manager of the health clubs network Antan Sakalausk.
"Our data, the man of the year's morning with his wife visited our health club, Mr. Fabionian.
The basic client flew about 30 minutes, then he moved to the basin trailing bands to leave and was unexpectedly disturbed after a few minutes.
The country of the former people -- a customer who smoked in a common tax and basein-based-based-based reactions, quit it out of the water and began to get out of the water.
The man was continually acquired until he arrived quickly.
Club employees immediately invited the quick medical assistance in 5 minutes.
The doctors returned the man’s puls and smoking and transferred him to a doctor’s car.
When the doctors went to the ligon, tried to stabilize the health status of the man, for example, after 20 minutes, we received information that the man was not alive.
We mean a heartfelt dead man’s dead deceived injury.
With the primary data, the event could have caused customer health problems.
According to the information given to your doctor, he is patient with sugar diabetes.
We recall that with serious health disorders, it is always important to evaluate our ability and to discuss the treatment and health club specialists.
All health clubs in the basic clubs are a builder whose main task is to observe the basein, its access and the security of the customers, it is designed by other employees.
These basin pigs shall have radio stations which may be directly contacted with the administration and registration, reply to their applications or advertise aid.
Four times a year, the staff in relation to the security programme is much more frequent than the law requires.
At their time, employees collect theoretical and practical knowledge, learn how to be conducted in the case of disaster, monitoring or compliance with the provisions of the internal and internal system.

In Norway, Grejina has changed even four and doesn't speak lately
As reported in the LNK, the case has failed to cover the rights of the Norwegian Children's Rights Service and the decision of the Court of Justice of Barnevernet, as it is written in the report, four years ago.
The story of the woman created a international scandal in the horse, which followed the whole newsground.
The Gentiles for the return of a boy to Lithuania also made his wife in Lithuania, and in Norway.
However, the public did not return to Greenna and its members of Lithuania's citizens.
Today, a woman says how she lived in the past few years separated from the latter, and how she and her child meetings have been distributed after two years.
At the time Grejina did not have the right to globe, the boy was 8-year, today 12th, at the beginning of the life.
For the first two years, Grejina had never seen it, it was broken.
Moreover, Grajina was granted the right to see two times per year, almost one hour.
Lastly, a few months ago, the numbers taken by the court at the meeting were increased to three times per year and extended to two hours.
The meetings with ability are always reminded of the assumptions in the grid round - observed by the officers, and replaced them is a hidden operation.
"The Son has even changed four and doesn't speak lately," - the heart of this morning will open Grajina, her story - LNC
Eligium will be returned to Masuilio for a short time to take personal money
The Court of Justice announced on Monday that it was rejected by the accused lawyer.
The decision is final and unnecessary.
In the case of political corruption, the E. Masiulis was head of the Liberal Conscious Court, in order to restore his personal money - through shortly taken money from his and his marriage money.
In total, more than 242 thousand euros were taken from E. Masuilio.
The provisional restriction of the right of property applies to these money, and it continues to expire.
The last time the Court of Vilnius appointed him on October 15.
E. Masiual Court requested not to return all money - he intended to recover from 800 euros and his money - 690 euros, 130 United Kingdom weights, 1600 dollars.
The former policy states that the last money was assigned to the United States planned road.
E. Masuilio's lawyer Mindaugah at the Court of Appeliac's meeting requested that these money be returned on Monday, since the wedding worked well payable and had such amounts.
Prosecutor Justus Laucius requested the opportunity to reject.
"The decision of the Court of Justice in Voluntary Court is legally and is not limited to any more property which is subject to the offences presented.
The right court concluded that it is the basis for the confiscation of the property and the consolidation of the extent of the property," said Mr. Laucius at the Court meeting.
On October 15, the Court of Agriculture of Vilnia decided not to return more than 242 thousand euros in the case of political corruption to E. Masuili.
These money are found through a short corruption of accusations in the home and in the car.
The college of three judges concluded that from the case, the substance is to see that the rights of property are limited only to funds that constitute an incidence of criminal acts to E. Masiuli.
"As parts of the limitation, it is concluded that the right of the prosecutor's owner is not limited to non-proportional or restrictively applied to a long term," says the Court of Nicoles, Jurgita's Collection and the Ugnius Trompule.
The judges have noticed that in the case of M. Masuilio is accused of committing serious crimes, a major and comprehensive case, so that in order to ensure the potential confiscation of the property and extensive confiscation of the property, it is necessary to request the time limitation of their ownership.
The prosecutor states that the former Vice-President of the MG Baltic Vice-President Raimonds Kurlianski has given 106 thousand euros to E. Masiuli for the adoption of benefiting decisions in Seime.
Both complaints believe that there is 90 billion euros to find money at E. Massue - was the loan of Mr. Kurlianski.
In the case data, over the rate to the US Masiu, 242,4 thousand euros, 130 United Kingdom weight sterlings and 1,6 thousand dollars.
E. Masuilio and his lawyer tried to recover the money, but the courts rejected their requirements.
The former policy has said that part of the funds belongs to other persons and was intended to invest in an immobilious property or to be the money of it.
He also stated that there were no data that the funds would be obtained in a criminal manner.
Previously, the Appeliac Court has concluded that the complaints submitted to Mr Masjuli could be shown that the funds could be received to him by receiving more than 100 thousand euros.
The law claims that pure money could be received from the sources of non-defined income, undeclared, unapprovaled documents and may not have any legal income.
In the case of political corruption, three legal persons are charged for the work party, the Liberal Soss, the Concern of MG Baltic.
Besides E. Masuilio, the accusations were submitted to the former "employment" to the Wytuut Gapshi, former parliamentary to Sharun Gustaini, Seimo na'i to Gintar Steponaviči and Vice-President MG Baltic to Mr. Kurlianski.
Mr. Kurlianski is charged by the former parliamentaries for E. Masiuli, Mr. Gustain and Mr. Gaps.
The Americans will have the dangerous Russian manuals to destroy
25 minutes during the transition, by the statement of the United States military forces, the Russian SU-27 was fastened directly by the airport.
The Russian aircraft spent it once a second time, using the speed of the train, and performed the movement with the powder.
The travelers reported the turbulence during the first approach and the second approach.
The Russian family has the right to carry out practices in the international airspace, but this interaction was unresponsibility.
We hope international standards, which ensure security and prevent a number of incidents that match the 1972 Convention on incidents in the sea and above the sea prevention (INCSEA), said in its report the United States military forces of the Sea.
"Because the action has increased the risk of inadequate calculation and potential compliance," it is noted in the report.
The Russian Federal Ministry recognised the incident, but he believed that the Russian SU-27 was "square" from the airport.
Parents' costs are not more than 50 euros per Monday:
The consideration of the "Studies of the Baltic Investigation" of the Market and the public opinions issued at the end of August showed that the third part (32 per cent) of their parents for the "acquiring" of a single school child before the school in this year had divided less than 100 euros, the fifth (21 per cent) issued from 101 to 150 euros, three of the ten (29 per cent) - from 151 to 200 euros and less than the fifth (18 per cent) for the training of his child at the end of the weekend of the feast.
Parents whose children began to go to the first class in this year, gave their child’s educational awards about 220 euros, and other parents whose children have already finished the first class shared a smaller amount for their child - about 160 euros.
However, the costs are no longer expensive for years, since parents often need to pay money for children’s warriors and adjustors.
On the basis of the construction of occupation, the price of one residence in the country may be decreased from 20 to 100 euros.
Parents who had children of school were asked to tell the amount they planned to make their child’s employment along Monday.
Fourteen (23 %) of the child's inquired works in a monthly plan for approximately 20 euros, a quarter (26 %), a payment for up to 50 euros, three of the ten (31 %) for the employment of the child is between 50 and 100 EUR per month, and the sixth (17 %) of the parents indicated that it was planned for 100 EUR or more.
In Lithuania, children of the educational age shall be assigned to the non-formal children’s education, which shall be EUR 15 per month.
However, these money can only be used for one warrant, and if the price of the occupation is greater, the divorce must be covered by parents.
In that case, if a child visits several staff or grows several children in school age, the expenses for popamokin activities may be duplicated.
As the "Vivus.lt" marketing company, Justina Ambrasiana, a small or low income income for the adoption of children, especially when a number of children grow, may become an unusual exhibition.
After the beginning of the year, parents had a head to get out of where to get money practices, cash goods or new sport equipment.
Now the main job is how to take children after school without leaving the money of the chief.
We note that the expenditure of parents is especially increased in August when it is necessary to prepare appropriately for the new period, but then it remains greater than for February, since parents wanted to invest in their resource employment.
Often, when the lack of funds is missing and responsiblely evaluates their responsibility, they are drawn up and delayed,” says J.Ambrasiaena.

Heavens are the fourth of the thirsty troleum
Today, the fourth show of the mobile road "Atia's old, good news" has been exposed to the Cousins Streets - a cheese and a record of "Senography records" of old troleums.
The new pleasant trolleum reported the cohesion of the city of Kauna.

An illustrated gyld car, which is often called just "wabal".
"You wanted to place the Troleum.
This seems very happy, especially because the roads of troleum are also matching.
When the walls are covered, it seems that it is part of that car.
When we hit the white walls, we made them like back styles, it was very closely combined with all the connections.
Before the troleum pounds had been broken, it was not really so swimming," - how much before the gate was cook.day.lt spoke the street owner.
And on 27 October, the boat was destroyed on the third trolleum.

Premier: 117 EUR after the income of ethnic payment of teachers
Since September, the model for ethical taxation has increased in EUR 117, the premier of Saul Schvernelis has been approved as a whole of the workshops of the country with pedagogs.
"It's before to say how much she (new work - BNS) has advantages or deficiencies.
The fact is that those who have full jobs - their distortions grow more than 117 euros in the first day," said the journalists in the Government, Mr. Skvernelis.
It calls "democratic rights" for the Lithuania Professional Union (LHDPS) to implement the streak on ethical taxation, but it is accent that the streak should not stop the development process.
"In the Democratic country all forms of protest are allowed.
If you think that you need to strike, it's their right to resolve.
It would not be aware that children would be hurt in this area, young people.
If it is a strike, it must be carried out in accordance with the existing laws," said Mr. Skvernell.
Seemburg has approved the model for the payment of the ethical teachers at the stages of the introduction from September.
The training of teachers has changed the time payment - the teacher's stage was 1512 hours per year.
The worktime of the teacher is divided into three parts: contact hours, e.g. training, preparation for them and the workshop.
This reform is called by the Professor Andriaus Navicko absurdly, deceiting that it is adopted by the principle of the "buldozer" and refers to an untermined struggle on November 12th.
The LSDP requires to reject this "minute" work payment system and to establish a ethnic model, in one phase, not more than 18 contact hours.
In addition, it is the obligation to increase 20% and to reduce the number of children in the classs.
In addition to other innovations, a new shared method of funds is criticized because, in the case of professionals, there is no enough funds to share in groups, groups, educational assistance, and in large towns as so were and remained filled.
The Ministry of Education and Education claimed that the ethical payment of the teachers is allowed to regulate pedagogical workers and to deal with all the works of the educational community.
It is expected that the work of the teacher's stage is able to work for the community for half of all hours in the year, the first two working years - up to 40 per cent of all hours.
It is determined that the worktime of the teachers is 36 hours a week, not more than 24 hours a weekly contacts to the obligation of learning.
In May, the two-hour initiative of LSDPs contributed to about half a hundred general training institutions for education, wood and non-formal development, approximately 10,000 pedagogs.
Overall, Lithuania is about 53,000 pedagogs.
Invites to be ready: the crisis can be expected in 2-3 years
The economic growth and even the crisis can be expected in the last 2-3 years, but both the Lithuania Bank and the Government of the country are more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, by the interview of the "Capital Radio" for the "Verslo position" of the Lithuania Bank, Vit Vasiliausk, President of the Government of Lithuania.
"To say that the crisis is already out of the camp, I can't really, but the characters of economic growth are actually.
This year our country's economic growth has grown more than 3 percent, and in the next year we plan 2,8 per cent growth.
The main news that I would like to tell the public and business - let's be ready for all," said Vasileus.
He thinks that there is no equal crisis, therefore they need different divisions.
The difference from the decade-year crisis is that the government now thought that the growing economic incomes would be forever and that the costs were planned.
Therefore, after the crisis was decreased in 2008, the costs were very drasticly reduced.
Now, says Vasilásko, the situation is different, and the crisis is better ready.
"In fact, we see that the situation of Lithuanian Bank and Financial Ministry is different.
We believe that we already have the potential and need to print the stage.
The Ministry of Finance has not done so,” said Lithuanian Bank's President.
The country's preparation for the nearby crisis V. Vasiliausk is a value of 7 of 10 balls.
It says that such a small and open economic as Lithuania is very seriously active in external factors.
The current major drama - the United States, China, the European Union - the injury between us will be uncertainly aware of us.
Therefore, we must be very quiet.
When we're small economics to say that we're decided everything, but I'm not going to do it," said Vassilian.
What will be the future to wait for those who have received great loans?
Mr. Vasilian stated that the European Central Bank has clearly established a short-term strategy, and decisions on interest else can be expected not before the February of the next year: "The good basic goal is at this time to try to control expectations."
The tendence that leads to anxiety to the leader of the Lithuania Bank is the reduction of work hands in our country.
"The decreasing of the hands is very part of the economic competitiveness and the reduction.
Moreover, this is the reduction of bread eating.
In this year, the migration allowed a little to balance this process, but it doesn't know whether this was a long-term trend," my V. Vasiliausk.
ELTA recalls that the Lithuanian Bank and the Ministry of Finance are predicted that the country's economy will grow 3,4 per cent and 2,8 per cent in this year.
The Swedish Conservator leader will try to form governments again
Sweden, who has been in the political campaign for two months ago, has been published by the President of the Parliament on the first day by the Conservative Party's leader.
Ulfo Kristerson (Ulfo Kristerson) The current party belongs to the four centres of the right party of Allians, which has received an extraordinary less balls than the previous control centre of the left coalition during September 9.
Both blocks were difficult to submit the majority of the rejecting of the anti-immigrant democratic partition of the Swedish Democracy party, which affected the movement of non-onacists.
The first test of U. Christerson on October 14, was uncomfortable.
On 29 October, the President Stefan Lofven (Stefan Liovenes) published his test on the end of the mandate.
In trying to convert the party to agree, President Andreas Norlen said that the next week he would propose Mr Christerson Parliament as a candidate to the premises, taking the first vote from the time of the government's efforts to form.
"I don't know whether different parties are at Ulf Kristerson as a premier," said the journalists, Mr. Norlene.
But he highlighted that "the process must put you in front, and the dynamic between the parties has to change."
"Independent negotiations have been completed," adds he.
The vote date of Parliament is not yet clear, but Mr Norlen said that between the possible data is 14 November.
In Sweden, the President of the Parliament may bring the candidate four times to form governments, even though the parliament agreed.
If all four tests are insufficient, the country must create new feeds.
The current design of U. Christerson is the third test of Mr. Norlene.
Some groups of Christian Democrats of the National Party and Allians are pressing U. Christerson to accept the support of the Democracy Party of the Right Rights of the Swedish Democracy, but he has been rejected.
The Sweden Democratic Party, which has received 17,6 per cent of balses and is a third party, has been ignored for a long time.
The Ultrast party, which has been successfully used by the carrier’s wrath for immigration, after nearly 400 thousand aerodrome researchers have reached the country from 2012, requires an impact on the adoption of decisions on aid changes.
However, the members of Allians, freedoms and centerists, are categoryally opposed to such vibrations.
Since 2014, with green and non-formal support for the rights of the Sweden Social Democrats Party (SAP) has made a part between the blocks, but only if it will maintain the premium post.
Allians and the Swedish Democratic Parties rejected this.

Presidency: LRT is not a political property
At the time of the meeting, the Chairman intends to address the conclusions of the investigation committee to the LRT activities, that the managers are simply intended to purchase more political controls to the public translation translator.
"The public translier is not political property, and the essential principle is to maintain the independent policy," explained the President's adviser Mindauga Linge.
However, an accent-consultator can now be made to an opposite process.
"We can see that these (polythetics. - ELTA) affect more.
We also appreciate it critically," said Mr. Lingua.
It states that the proposals of the Seime LRT committee are ambitional and doubtless legal, as it applies to the independence of the translator.
Although Mr. Lingua emphasised the improvement of the LRT management, it is necessary to carry out the support of experts and to look for specific aspects that prevent LRT activities.
It focuses on the fact that the international authorities now highlight that the activities of the LRT should be implemented not by the political, but by the competent authorities.
On Monday, Seimas intends to adopt a decision on the activities of the CRT.
These conclusions were critical.
It is very skepticly evaluated that it is proposed to change the management of the LRT - to reduce the Council's powers and to establish its members' mandates with the scheduled institutions.
The European Translators Union shall therefore take into account the integration of this.
The opposition group of members of the Seimoh was in June to the Constitutional Court of Justice as regards whether the special parliamentary committee who operates and is financed is not opposed to the Constitution.
Working foreign - good news from Mr. Karbauskio
Simim began to consider the correction of the Law of Lithuanian Lithuanian and Green Union Group of the former Ramun Karbauski of the Lithuanian Lithuania, which would be forgiven by the citizens who work and taught non-Lithuania from the payment of obligatory health income.

The draft draft at the plenary meeting of Seim is planned to examine the Committee on 6 December. Seim also decided to request the conclusions of the Government.
In accordance with the proposed project, the persons who taught social income in the Member States of the European Union, in the European Economic Area State or in the Swiss Confederation are the decision of the Government of the Social Institute of Social Insurance Fund to be exempted from the training of committed health in the Republic of Lithuania.
Living and working in Lithuania, the systems submitted and approved data from Lithuania by the Government of the State Affairs Fund (Sodra) and the State tax inspection.
We are talking about the service that man does not use.
In addition to fixing that man has gone out," from the Seim Tribunal explained Mr. Karbauski.
This proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Conservator of Seimo, Antano Matulo, would be unfair about the citizens in Lithuania and the citizens who are paying payments.
"The part of the foreign ships uses this bad use," noted Mr. Matulus.
Social Democrat Algird Syss thinks that this way we encourage citizens to not hold the impatience.
It considers that there would be access to wise people to use the health system freely.
The adjustment of the legislation is proposed, the person who has gone to live in other countries, learns social income, non-supports, facilities for the administration of the "Sodros" debts.
Currently, for citizens of Lithuania, who have actually gone out of Lithuania, the act set out in the legislation does not have been established in the Register of Lithuania's residents, there are more debts of the obligation for health insurance (PSD) and, if they are not taught, the debt shall be purchased.

Procuratory A. Duonel claimed that in 2013 he was in the wex, which now was his former wife, Delios Burocatees, managed to the "Dalecia" cabinet of odontology, he had 200 thousand litres (approximately 58 euros).
The wedding learned only on December 2016 when it received encouragements to cover the training.
As a married couple, he said to a man’s clinical rate, he never left any part and never had a wheel.
With the confidence of the Court of Justice, there are no objective data that show that it is A. D. Dunellela that it would have recorded incompatible data that the UAB "Dalecia" has not been eligible for A. D. Duoneel 200 thousand lithiums.
In accordance with the arguments expressed in the case of the judge and its claim, there are no objective data that confirm it.
In such a way, the fact that Mr Dunellela only used a certain document for the public and recognised that this sign is the use of a devastated document - is a complicated part of the violation (in the case of appealing), Mr Dunellela is justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Building Code, without prejudice that he was involved in making a criminal action," says the Court of Auditors of Wilnie.

Antonino Scalia's claims that his father's liberal protests on Kavanaugh'o
On Wednesday, the Fox News Agency of the High Court of Justice Antonino Scalia said that his father would not be surprised by the protest of the land forces against the named judge Bret Kavanaugh’, because Scalia believed that Auk was the principal court of the present world.
"Bendrai, his very disturbance on nomination to the Almighty Court, because a lot of things supported Roe against Wade case – at least the right to the left” said Christopheris Scalia, recalling the sign of the 1973 case, after which the constitutional rights of women to the abort was established in certain trimesters.
In one case, Roe has destroyed all the rights of all States to regulate abortions and some countries, responding to this decision, trying to limit the right to the abort.
"My father often states that Roe against Wade and other cases truly tried to resolve cultural problems, although it had to be resolved through the changes and the law of publications," adds it through the presentation of the "Fox & Friends" flag.
“In order to share the process, the Supreme Court has added more damage, therefore the nominations to the Supreme Court and the warfare of approval cause a more significant reaction, since the judges are playing a role belonging to law laws.”
The Nebrasian Senator Ben Sasse's republic at this Monday meeting on the similar opinion of Kavanaugh's approval, repealing that Congress often gives too many powerful institutions, which are in principle nothing responsibility, and some of the birocratic issues allows the Supreme Court to address, therefore, the judges have to take the work which the Senators will reject.
The Chapter's chair police took up and accused hundreds of protestants for the unlawful changes to the candidate approval process.
A question was asked if Kavanaugh could avoid anti-reactions for uncertain sexual offences that he had done a few decades ago, Scalia said that it would probably not be able to avoid disturbance.
In response to the statements that Kavanaugh should not be responsible for the Supreme Court, since on Thursday, through the Senator's consultation, the repeated and sometimes, Scalia doubted whether all judges are the character of peace.
“The judges are often appealing,” Scalia said, speaking about the wrong injuries that sometimes occur in the opposite cases.
"Truely, judge Kavanaugh's have to be more aggressive, but it was other circumstances.
He tried to defend his good name from unapproved accusations."
On Thursday, most of the parties' votes (11 before 10) are allowed to participate in the whole Senata's vote.
Or if the Senator of the Republic of Jeff Flake's dramatic view is to give Kavanaugh his lower balse only if the FTB is given to a weekly investigation on the present probably offence crime, Kavanaugh's requests.
The investigation has been carried out and the President Trumpas said that the agency has granted broad powers and that it can be questioned “what they have been able to do.”
Schiaparelli’s clothes collection – fantastic coverages
Is it possible to introduce surrealism?
Schiaparelli asked to answer this question.
The house of Paris’s madness, which was born almost a hundred years ago with Elsa Schiaparelli, presented his first collection of clothes and hands.
Fantastics, and not buying prepared clothes for the brand of the goods, this collection is almost not like the sound Els Schiaparelli's shadow of the bath form.
The excentric imagination has been shown this time and how very modern.
In Estonian solutions, you will find feelings, ammars, hearts and eyes.
Schjaparelli made its first combination in 1930 and was the first design, which models lived under music.
She and her friend Salva Dali thought to compatibilize myself and mad, and now Calvin Klein and Rafas Simons, with the U.S. Lady Sterling Ruby.
The legend of the legend that Deli and Schiaparelli were created and the moth of Omar was cut off a nightmare before the demonstration wanted to select a real maionez, but did not wait for the approval.
Black shoots without fifths with the design of Mano Rayaus "Electité" on the office.

"We wanted to turn back to the depth, which is not separated from the story of Schiaparelli," said the creation director of Bertrand Guyon, who was called on the household room in Vandam, last three years.
By creating a collection of clothes, he took Schiaparelli's friendship with Manu Ray, and with the My Ray's Fund, and dressed according to well-known men's creation.
The picture of the madman's eye attached to the "Sticky Eye" is represented on the boxes of Perspex, and the red mouse from the "Observatory Time: Lovemen" has been pressed on the real siluet box with a collision.
My Ray'aus "Sticky Eases" on the collection boxes
One of Elsa's changings was an appropriate attachment to the S. Jos's firm: "Shoking rose" inspired her "Shokings".
The first Guion building "Schiaparelli" hand with the rock's box on the name "Shift".
Their small price will also be fantastic – 5000 £.
A timely sale was shown at the left of the Year's season, where the surrealism of Paris's mad half week was demonstrated and could be purchased by Virgile Abloho from the Ikea collection immediately shown.
More than 500 young Abloho honorers were spent in a line on an adjacent, unexpectedly purchasing one of his creation's best prices than Louis Vuitton's men's clothes.
Ablohui this project helps to reach a larger auditorium than that of which is available for a practical mouth or design.
“No one has no ownership, but the knowledge of a certain stage can help to get a conversation at the southern table.
That's what he's thinking about a thousand years of age," he recently said.
The assembled guards in the Marais area realized that this garage would be prepared to the sea when the models started to carry them on the halls.
The Witness Westwood husband said of Andreas Kronthaler, a collection of free men and women of freedom was based on Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabul's portraits.
Some high-speaked sandals of women (and several men) walked in the chairs, but the roads were on the side of the flashing platforms.
Westwood, watching the presentation in the first line and raising the collection box with the arc moths and the oranginal cardigane that was bound through the rock, had been connected to his husband and gave her a beauty box.
Double connections in photos
Detroite was born and Peter Zelewski in London was already established as a road photograph when two photographs began to be photographed four years ago.
"I, as a portrait photograph and humans, have always had a double and unexpected connection of which everyone is talking about," he says.
The photograph doesn't plan to create the whole project, but it says, “I have reached the first two portraits of the first two, and the way was not back.”
Soon the Zelewski book “Double” will be printed in 44 identical two pars and history.
This project is visual, he says: "This is not a documentary or a single project, I wanted to photograph the effects and the sensitive human portraits."
For the uncertainty of the professional union, which leads to debt
The members of the Council of the Kingdom disease, uncomfortable with the National Health Service of the Procurement Service, shall be denied by the Union after voting, and have charged it with the exhaustive requirements for the increase in the payment which was deemed.
This unprecedented decision was adopted after the debates made at the Kingshot College, when the Secretary-General Janata Davis, his former Secretary-General, had wrongly admitted to the members that they would raise 3 per cent in this year when the 1 per cent limitation of payment would be eliminated.
The members insisted on the exhibition of the injury, and they insisted on David's dealing with the responsibility, then presented the petition, and the five-day meetings were held in Birmingem, after the unbelieving Council of the college.
"Birmingem's debates have helped to clarify the relationships, so the college will only be strengthened," said the Royal Colection College of the Carl Trewern.
“Basing clearly and the Council of the Kingdom Hall and the leadership understood the news sent to her.
The Council has already made changes in the organization in recent weeks and has tried to listen to the words of the members and to include them; we will continue to try to implement it."
The assembly will take place the next week and hope that the members of the Counsel of the Kingdom Hall will take place.
“The foundation of the strength is confidence” said the national health service injury to the ‘Guardian’ period.
“The Council of the Carnal Affairs has distorted its confidence, therefore the Council must be suspended.
I hope that she will be honest and listen to the request.
I'm interested in whether other professional union members will also be reordered."
In August, the general professional Union officer of the National Health Service, Rachel Harrison said: "Guardian's alga, the national health service employees of the country understood the unexpected survival.
That's what they're doing."
Before the non-concerning meeting, the Country of the City recognised that it was added to errors in the 2018 negotiations on remissions and was clearly informed of them.
However, it is also stated that the Royal Sweden College campaign for the destruction of the payment limits has made the governments to refuse this restriction and have been caused to increase the rate of 6,5 per cent within three years.
The vote was established after an independent investigation, which concluded that college had been able to enter into negotiations, and Davies was accused of an inadequately cruel assessment of the negotiation.
It is stated that the Country of the Sweden has submitted unfair information, therefore the Members could not adopt a decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
Coled* has published an opponent information on whether all employees will have 3 per cent increased.
In the short report before college transfer of residues, it was incorrectly stated that planned “3 per cent rise and increase in the implementation of the reform”.
In fact, something should have been advanced to 3 per cent, and only some of the employees receiving acquiring acquirers would have been once increasing.
“Almost all the information provided to the members on the implementation of the negotiation was misunderstood (once it was attempted to simplify it)”, said the results of the market reform service.
"The ERS believes that the country adopting decisions was not comprehensible and clear to explain the differences of the existing system and the proposed transaction, and that the calculations of 6,5 and 29 per cent of the numbers referred to through the campaign were therefore not allowed to be adopted."
The decision to sign uncertainty agreed with 78 per cent of voters, and at the vote, 3,74 per cent of the members of the Country of Sweden.
Lindsay Lohan shokkers of the "Instagram" direct translation guards by trying to "group" children from
Lindsay Lohan was critical about the "Instagram" direct translation through which she followed Benamies in the street and tried to separate from parents.
Direct translations, mostly filmed in Maskwa (with the previous updated in Instagram history) at the beginning, the actor made it possible to take care of the nightmare place, but the situation is quickly complicated.
"Good to everyone, from showing what I met," she said to the guards, "that are refugees from Syria, I am very deeply engaged in them.
They really need help.
Do you want to go with me?
"We're going to get to you," she said before he cried to one of the children, "Do you want to stay in the hotel?
Do you see the movies?
It would be hard to learn a movie through television or computer."
After the fathers refused, Lohan reacted oppositely.
"Your children shouldn't be on the street, try to work hard and do everything for them to improve their life.
“If anyone offers them a house and a nightmare, as I am now, you will meet.
They're back to you.
Nowhere or without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't worry about me."
When the actor tried to stop Lohan by going on the street, the actor followed it directly through Instagram.
“What are you doing is trade for children, so you cultivate the Arab culture.
Take children, though they don't want to go with you.
Children, don't worry, I'm with you, and now the world sees us all."
Translation ended the physical confrontation – it seems that Mother shot Lohan.
The records of the medicine were increasing in the social newspaper and some benefits were interested in whether this could not be used for the test.
The Index contacted Lohan's distance for comments.
The third British thinks that he will never pay all the debt
Nearly the third part of the British believes that throughout life they will not be able to cover their debts, and man from 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
The Equifax and the Gorkana studied that the results of the only "The Inde" showed that the British, especially belonging to the 18-24-year-old group, believed that the whole life would have debt and only half of them hoped to be removed from them.
In the previous year, the Fishal Research Institute report states that the final students have a debt of approximately 46,000 £ and the most poor students remain more than 57,000 £.
Most of the soldiers (81 per cent) will never pay all debts, thus the first 30 years of work will be pressured.
University accommodation grows: With the data of the National Department, the United Kingdom debts are a recording size and the britains each year deduce 900 £ more than an interview.
But is it worth worrying about this childhood?
Is the whole pressing debt just a new way of life for young people (and all the public)?
For example, cars that are other stamp buyers can be recorded when they get home (if such a success occurs).
Auto Trader this week predicted that in decade, all new cars will be transferred to payment – that will be the way for transportation.
The EQ Investors Director and a verified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believed that the expectations were really changed.
“In these times, it is really a normal part of debt: it has extended credit cards, free refinancing, student loans and quick credits,” she said.
"Our grandparents were sometimes worried to debt."
At this time, the price debts of students and students have become normally significant.
This statement is also accepted by Moira O'Neill, the Section of the Interactive Investor's personal funds, which believes that the results can cause anxiety.
“If you debt a debt that four or five times exceeds your income, you may show that the additional debts are not needed.” she explained.
And that's the way people's getting in trouble.
The interest rate has been small for many years, therefore, a large loan or other debts have to claim what would happen if the norm would be replaced."
You should not be sure that financial industry commentators have no doubt.
Brian Brodies, director of the Freedom Finance Agency, says: "The school is not too.
The school is not supported by the last outcome for home replacement or a new car.
Because of small interest norms, many have helped a relationship with the expired costs, from which a higher return is obtained, but it is not so easy to achieve the cost of money.
The average class is therefore more debt.
In the past six months, about half of the new jobs received great customers with a creditability assessment."
The leader of the TDX Group's financial problems of the Equifax company considers that such expectations are that the whole life is not to be taken out of debt is really anxious.
He states: “The majority of the inflation was covered in six months (2.7 per cent), the interest rate was decreased, and the employment increased, and it does not contribute to many people’s decisions to debt without having a realistic plan of refunding.
Our analysis showed that in this year the number of individual bankrotes will be of 17 per cent, and the main factor is the recordial debt of consumers."
The school may not take a lot of effort until a man works and works, but it does not understand how unfailed injury will affect his goodness in the old age.
The economy and business investigation centre, conducted with the funds charged by specialists from More 2 Life, showed that the debts of non-reviewed persons in 55 to 74 in the past four years were more than three years, i.e. more than two times faster than the average country.
This age group is often debt through the credit cards, and each month 30 per cent is more than the demand.
Boyle adds: “The more people in 55 C.E. are able to pay debt from pension funds, and this will affect their life in pension.
Most often, it's the only marriage they'd have to go.
Furthermore, people think that by using property, they will be paid later, but when they change the property to the money, they will not be able to pay the money as much as they were.
If the money prices fall, this situation will only be sent down."
In the middle of Serena Williams, "I Touch Myself" was able to take attention to the cancer of the cup.
Serena Williams issued a video record, in which she serves the classic "Divinyls" day "I Touch Myself" with the hands of a neighborhood.
The axes of Tennis shared the clip on their Instagram page and explained that the video record was made to see the woman's own confidence.
"I wrote the "The Divinyls" version of the world heat "I Touch Myself" to remember the woman's regular confidence," wrote Williams.
"So I went out of my comfort area, but I wanted to do this because this problem affects all racial women worldwide.
The most important to be determined is that it helps to save many lives.
I hope I'm able to remember the woman."
Williams continued: "This music clip is a part of the project "I Touch Myself", which is implemented by a significant Chrissy Amphlett, she died from a cancer and gave us her step to remember the woman's primarily in the health."
The support project was started in 2014 after the death of Amphlett in 53.
The medical record, published by the tennis star in his Instagram, grew over 1,5 million overseers and many seals for the way the tennis was compressed.
“Let your refreshment for this rock and your courage to do this.
Thank you, Serena," wrote the honorer.
Next adds: “Serena, this is UNOSTABU.
Before 20 years, I was overcoming the cancer and saw myself a little, even when the mamograms did not show anything.
It's right to make sure.
Thank you for not be afraid to get out of the comfort zone, you're a real dear!"
The "Berley" project "I Touch Myself Project" also issued a new "The Chrissy" cheese of the animal skin text, which inspired the hand star.
100 percent of the profits that have been sold by the BCNA will be offered.

Adam Driveris converted the whole SNL filming group to cover
Adam Driveris was the big star Saturday Night Live this week, and he tried to disappoint all of them.
The best fresh railways are often not associated with the specific current event — as the new day of the Care Day.
The United States Mediterranean School Day, when teachings take their fathers, and the same Mortdecai's (Pete Davidson) does not want his father, the old oil size of oil Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driveris), to say the language.
The lazdel, whose megalomanian person could inspire Daniel Day-Lewis' worker Daniel Plainview from the "Bus blood", pictures tell how the oil industry was controlled.
“I was born in seven months in the morning,” Parnassus said to the schools.
“Incubators were just grown up, so I was put into the bowl and heavy in the pipe woods until I learned to be kids.
My bones didn't be afraid, but not my spirit!
Be strong and striving your enemies."
Davidson and his colleague SNL actor Aidy Bryant, who calls a teacher, even feels unrelated and can't live in the eyes of Drive.
However, the staff of the Star Wars are just running and it begins to tell about the individual war with another oil magazine H. R. Pickins.
"I've seen your bowl!" he said
"I filled her wheat with my desired seed and made your boyfriend, that's my final feast, H. R.!"
Parnassus became the same impression of Adam's driver person as Kylo Renes from two films.
"Be proud, H. R.!"

Courts of the Court of Auditors
The Council can be called a representative of the home area where we leave time with friends, we accept the Witness and Mrs., so it is to make it fit so that it would be not only for boat or householders but also for healthy people.
On the basis of the size of the website, the walls, the decoration of the walls, the shadow of the rubbers, the choice of the corresponding balls.
The Council should be not only beautiful but also nice.
The best help to introduce the internal design, which will help optimally fill the area so that it does not become too busy or open - too empty.
Firstly, it is recommended to set a main page point, namely the thing you will connect to, other details.
This may be a chamber or other important accent of the website's internal.
The Council would also be nice to create a chat room where the people could be strictly common, so that they would not stop the balls and Mrs.
Sophos, the stone should be established at the other so that your friends can stand and speak.
Thus, the boarding must promote society, unity of people, not to remove them from one another.
Don't stop the balls at the wall.
The size of the room depends on how distance should be from the border.
Though rooms and small, you will leave at least a little place from the wall, do not stop the balls at the same side.
If the room is large, leave more places from the walls.
In fact, the greater distance is better.
Make a balance by fixing a wallet
Consider the various details that will be on your website. Size and location.
All elements must be intersected.
The Council's advice must be compatible with the internal details.
Possible little contrast.
He's going to live inside, but he shouldn't be too big, because the inner will be insane.
I'd like to talk to the interior.
If you don't have the necessary knowledge, you risk the exception of the landscape: or you will create an internal inner, because you'll be afraid of experimenting, distorting, choosing wrongly or improvizing.
Valid lighting
That's the same thing.
Because different lights are different to discover the area.
Lighting must be set in various characteristics: the white lights, the wall lights, on the grid building.
Procuratory approved a justifiable depreciation for LKF heads
The prosecutor of the Wilnia approximately approved a justificative depreciation to the leaders of Lithuania's Cross-Federation (LKF).
As the procurement reported on the morning, the compatibility of the city of Paneveji has no legal basis for the compatibility of the budget with monetary funds to contribute to the restructuring of the private hotel in the Panevege.
In the course of the Iecitism study, it stated that in 2010, in order to finance public restructuring, the contracts for public purchase and sale between Lithuania's cross-border Federation and the town of Panevasji have been financed.
The prosecutor states that, in accordance with this Treaty, the Federation had to give the town's ownership, it was unchanged and unable, since the provision of services was already received or the financing of the State and Employment funds had already occurred before the contract and already paid from other funds, and the part of the equipment had occurred after the exemption of the VAT accounting factures - money was transferred for non-compliant facilities.
The prosecution of the Volnium appropriation claims that it is not compatible with the first instance's sentence to the conclusion that the same State has prepared and led itself to take a private restructuring of the town of Panevesji, since no State's requiring for a particular host is only the proposal for the town's ownership as soon as to address the issues of the town's development for the Championat.
In the opinion of the procurement, the Court has not reacted to the fact that the LKF and the Panevege Compatibility managers tried to comply with the State preparation without having the legal paths of it, since the data in the case were to be shown that it was able to create the deterioration of the European Championate Group in other cities, unless the laws were violated.
The prosecutor of the Wild Court asks for a decree that the first instinctive sentence of the court will be eliminated, and that in this case a new offence - a debat for seven physical persons and one legal person.
On October 15, the Court of Agricultural Court for all incriminated crimes has completely justified the Baltic General Secretary-General of the LKF Mind.
This case relates to the preparation for European men in Lithuania in 2011.
The complaints were made to Mr Balciun for misuse, destruction and other crimes.
Mr. Balciun claimed that, in carrying out the responsibility of the Secretary-General of the LKF, he agreed with the financing of the Federation, and the Director of the Federation, that, in the name of the Federation, it would be to carry out unconformed works - transmission acts and other financial documents to the official accounts and accounts for the service provided by the LKF.
The Iecitism study carried out by the Manufacturer of the Special Research Agency (STT) data may have been identified and classified for the benefits of the LKF and later used for the restructuring of the Via Unica public of "Romantic".
The leader of this hotel, Dalia Kuklieriene, was accused of a paper - is advised that she gave TV to Mr. Balchiun as a coach.
All of the persons with Mr. Balchium are rightly justified.
In this case, claims were submitted to eight physical persons and to one legal person - to Lithuania's Cross Federation.
Remote workplace - like Bermuda triangle
In Lithuania, the number of people would be deceived or fished since 1992 to now have exceeded the total number of people in the city of Alytaus and are about 83,000 people.
If a specific physical workplace and its security requirements are like and clear, it is the choice of a new Bermuda triangle to work remotely - from homes, public areas or even other countries.
By the statement of insurance specialists, although the Labour Safety and Health Law provides a continuous work for workers from non-separated safety and health conditions of other enterprises, the diversity of modern working forms may cause a number of issues, it is written in the pressing report.
After a disadvantaged event occurred in the forest, the first two unemployment days from 80 percent are taught employees, and for the rest of the period, "Sodra".
If a failure occurred during the work - from the first day of unemployment, the "Sodra" is 100 per cent of work.
In evaluation of the State labour inspection and the BTA, the damage is due to the fact that the outstanding of the majority of disadvantaged events and divergence of disturbances occurs in work.
This is most often a variety of physical works where the risk of injury is higher: unconformed conduct with devices or equipment, loss of concentration or coordination.
However, the offices in which the majority of the most listening specialists are now associated with their own exemptions, and the freedom of mobility of the employees is attracted," says the BTA Chair of Manual Resources Management Chapter Jevgeny Crixion.
It is recommended in Lithuania to clearly regulate the responsibility of the employee and the limits of responsibility to define the working time, the location and functions of the work in force and by forming the work in a remote manner.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred during the work or not.
The situations and niuans are actually available in various cases, which are individually.
Workers are often listening to the fact that the responsibility of the employee is, as if we are based on the work or from it or by traveling to work meetings for the unfair events.
However, the niuans and costs in this case are truly large, so I encourage both employees and employees to initiate conversations, to clarify and make sure that both sides are really acceptable to imagine what situations are actually considered as a disadvantaged work, and to which the status of foreign traumatisms will already be done," advised the specialist.
Mr. Crixion states that the worker will work in the agreement and the time and time in this time when working work is often sufficient for computer and mobile phone and stable Internet connections.
Workers are mobile, they can choose to work not at home today, but drinking coffee in coffee or park in the sun.
It's gonna be a job, isn't it?
What if the working hours still are not in accordance with the provisions of the agreement?
The expertist states that there may be no significant situations in which the survey can be clarified, which is the "Sodros" or the National Working Inspection," says.
Their statement, in the financial sense, is the main difference between the work of the event and the outside, the amount of unemployment payment.
Mr. Crixion recognises that it has been unufficially dealing with the increasing experiences that workers are trying to hide the real disadvantaged events or traumatisms and try to call employees to go to the medicals, to take response to themselves, so that they are financially disrupted.
This is an insensitive, unrespectable view of the worker and it should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the human mobility already mentioned is encouraged to search for additional instruments that could help companies in similar situations: this is also a civil responsibility for the employee's damage, an accidental insurance against disorder, incapacity or even in the case of death, as well as the current and health insurance," says Mr. Crickingone.

Without a few respects, Lithuania's Sardinian trainer from PAR Ntando Manyosha recognised the advantage of the wallets and said that such wallets had given a lot of valuable experience.
"Lance played very good and dominant in all game components.
Our goal was to stay in these speakers as longer.
We have just reached this higher position and have to discuss it.

Japanese guardians are intensely searching for low islands
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to the entire small island in the north of Japan.
A little, achievement and an incredible island, which was actually wrong for life, was very important for Japan.
What does it mean that her deep territory is now intensely eating - maybe it's still happening?
Why does Japan need these islands so?
You're going to go.
It was expected that the ice and the subwater swimming of this island were surrounded at all times, although it was still recently over two meters over the water.
It is almost uncertain that the island is usually swimming, but at least it is hoped to find its feet.
When the island started nobody almost knew - she was so deceived that no one had too much of her and did not.
The first of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima, mostly, learned Japanese fishers who sometimes used the island as a supported tool for visual navigation.
Their destruction is not even a tragedy for these fish, because there are better ways to gain fishing where the Russian waters are starting.
It was so, and it was Esanbe Hanakita Kojima.
The landbar was the same signature of the west of the Kuril salin.
This is the village of the islands named Russia in Kuril Islands, and Japan in Northern Territory.
The conflict with such interruptions continued from the middle of the 19th century, but the full force was in the 20th century.
In these areas, there are natural resources, but Japan is also historically thinking that the islands should belong to her.
The Japanese island is being investigated since the middle of the 17th century.
The first of them made a landscape, made more extensive studies, registering many small villages.
The agreements made between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that Sachalin was the last intention, and Japan is all the Koril Islands.
Thus, these two countries lived until 1905, while the Russian Empire war was destroyed by Japan.
In 1945, the Soviet Union used the situation in Japan and opened the Koril Islands.
Japan, outside, doesn't refer to the large preventions of the whole salon, although there were the first ones, but the four islands would want to be: Itarup, Kunasy, Shikotan Islands and Chabomay.
Japan feels that he has historical rights because the island was tested by the first, and it belonged to Japan in accordance with 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan invited Russia to divide these four islands, but Russia did not even consider that they would be accepted.
Japan is too close to the North Territory, but now the island starts this geografic connection is like a loss.
This physical indicator of Japan’s residence in these waters.
This is a big loss, so it is searching for the island's residues.
However, even if Esanbe Hanakita Kojima finds them will not comply with the definition of the island - that must be a secureness.
This means that the Japanese territory will be a little amount and a strong amount will be the exceptional economic area calculated from the borders.
I'm interested in what you hope for the island search mission - it'll really leave or disappear.
Uninterpreted drama in Lithuania and Poland's boxes
More than a week, the final valuation of the judges became a transnational meeting between Lithuania and Poland.
In Poland there were nine duplicates of poland and rubber.
Four accuracy took the boxes, even - and the locks.
The final decision of the secretariat of a long-term court-making college has been adopted at the end of the duplication.
The market meeting started with Lithuania's boxing consequences.
Lithuania's Multiple Champion Marius Wysnyusk (swary category to 52 kg) guaranteed:0 killed Jacob Surma, soon Edgar Skurdel (to 60 kg) after the return of March 2:1 influenced Radomir Obrušniak.
The following followed two consequences: Damian Durkaczes (to 64 kg) 3:0 influenced Mantua Duzina, and Philip Wachala (to 69 kg) 2:1 announced Simon Ban.
Lithuania has returned Vitauta Balsys (to 75 kg).
Lithuanian 2:1 killed Bartosh Golebiewsk.
In the other battle, Peter Ščukovkis (to 81 kg) in the third round, the clear persuasion influenced Eygirda Kasmots and the result again became 3:3.
Differently followed Joculi’s brothers.
Robert Jokulis (to 91 kg) 3:0 killed Andrés Colton, and Arvyda Jokuli (91 kg) had to recognize the prospect of Adam Kulik in the first round.
The most discussions were made by Tado Tamashausko (to 91 kg) and Michala Sochinski's fight.
The publication of the final result of its intergovernmental meeting prohibited more than a week.
One judge has assigned a consequence to the link, two judges to the case, but the points to Mr. Sočinski were used for the technical error of one judge.
Following long-term weapons overcome left to the police boxer - 2:
In Lithuania and Poland, the results were achieved by the Lithuanian and Polish meetings at 10:8 (for the end are assigned to 2 points).
They were urged to reject the cases for the past one another's experienced disappointment.
In 2015, at the meeting in Mary Poland, Lithuanian boxers took even five of the six footshops and gained the result 10:2.
Lithuania's travellers meeting in Poland was a general repeat before the Lithuanian box championat on 14-17 November.
The country's priorities will be formed as a new Lithuanian box, which will protect the country's honor in the world and European championates in the next year.
How did the dog determine that the man went in the direction?
You already know that the dog's pool is very sensitive.
They can cause hidden pressures, drugs, blood, other animals, some of which even recognize diseases.
It is well known in movies to kiss feet dogs, but their work is much more different than you thought.
How do they determine that the owner of the feet was moved to the direction?
This question is actually something more complex than you think.
The follow-up of the subsequents includes three steps - finding, alignment and follow-up.
The second stage is far more different than two other, since when the footnote was difficult to delay, a man moved to the direction.
Because between different steps, it's not been a second, so they're not very different, right?
Not all like that.
In 1990, the experiments that were published in the Oslo University Research, during which the trajectory had passed, have been introduced by the dog in 90 steps.
You are trying to perform on the bottle and the asfalt.
And in many cases, the dogs have easily set the direction of man’s coming, even when he tried to deceive them in the past.
Can you imagine what is the importance of this task?
The difference between the fast-screen cow is very small and with time it still reduces.
However, the speakers say that it's not so funny - the dog could say and what part of the foot was the first part of the land.
That is because their pool is an incredible tool.
The dog dominates the areas responsible for the hair (as in our brain dominates the regions responsible for the brain).
The dog's nose has 125-300 million copper receptors.
In general, the dog gate is at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but a more larger role leads to their ability to interpret differently.
Scientists then performed analogue experiments and bicycles left, but dogs were very difficult to follow their direction.
That's because bicycle cancer is not segmentated as a human floor, so it's more difficult to isolate different places for the planning -- it's not natural for dogs, so it's needing more time.
Indeed, the dog is not the strongest owners of the forest.
This title would probably be matched for the ships.
The white bottles are a hundred miles [100 km] sequence of the white bottles, and the red bottles offer a beast of even 30 miles [30 km].
Private bottles request to regulate roads
Minister for the Environment Coast Navick on Wednesday Seime will explain about the creation of mysteries.
At the end of August, the public's disturbance in the Labanore regional park was injured.
The moon was stopped.
The Minister has recognized that Labanore's studies showed that the grave crimes have not been made.
The Ministry of Environment has, however, already introduced a part of restrictions, taking into account the proposal of the Working Group to threaten the circulation of muscles in the areas belonging to the country.
The Minister demands that other laws which correct the movement of the bottle will be prepared until the end of the year.
The same restrictions are made to be applied in the landscapes and in private forests.
Agne Jagelavichiute reflected the strategy of sub--170 thousand followers
You need to give people what they want, and together to get what you want, in the LRT TV "Culturing with Nomda" says Agne Jagelavichiut.
According to the stylist, she's going to swim the people of the honors.
"I'm starting to get a man's shot, and you're at your own, and timely running in the square better," expects Mr. Jagelavichiut.
A. Jagelavičiuta has more than 170 thousand followers - she reached such numbers using a certain strategy: "You're starting to stuck a man's dress, you're going to yourself, running along with this square to be better."
Stilist Jagelavichiut acknowledges an infidelity, thus shows his face as it is - authenticity and ability to find the best way of presentation is the most important way in the social networks of the population.
It notes that there is no social networks for human cultures, because many internal people are going to them in order to make some of the comments of other insecuring people, "For example, for example, it was a meta when I wanted to flee with all and change - I don't want it now."
"Incertain life is the greatest thing.
And it is very much in social networks.
Feisbuke is less than instagram," she says.
Interior design and creation education, Mr Jagelavičiuta, says on social networks sending a specific message - speaks of women's emancipation.
It also advertises the production of magazines, and in its work it also works on creation.
"I can't say that the magazine of the mad is a pure man's expression, but I know it's really much there.
I wish there are many creatures in my work, as well as emptyness.
I'm balanced, it's my racket in these two numbers.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Wherever anyone better gives the people what they want, and quietly takes what you want," hopes Mr. Jagelavichiut.
One of the most difficult concerts of the youth - classical music concerts.
Their popularity to increase known people have proposed through life stories: to speak about losses, accidents, livelihood events, so that they are authentic.
As such a strategy, Mr Jagelevichivita proposes to apply to all cultures.
They, in fact, do not have any customs, or show certain values, the culture has no adjustment.
"How's the guard against students - are there any chances?
If we don't find a certain way to adjust this menu, advertising it will not be able to reveal anything.
When we are real and we're going to get a reader, maybe somebody's going to change.
I grew once, second, third, and already dependence," she shared in a comment.

"I've experienced sexual violence"
The President's adviser Kellyanne'a Conway showed the experienced sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway comments of the arms between judge Bretto Kavanaugh’o, candidate to the Supreme Court of Aug, and his accusator, Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford.
Conway's disappointed discovered that itself has experienced sexual violence, and Cavanaugh's rebellion against the leader of Jake Tapper, saying that the judge is offended by ignoring the unfair facts for the offenders.
“I am very disappointed by sexual violence and violence.
I trusted that I was sexually conceived,” Conway said in the CNN Saturday ship "State of the Union".
“I'm a victim of sexual violence and I don't think judge Kavanaugh, Take's Tapperis, Jeff Flake, or who else is responsible for this.
We must be responsible for our conduct."
Conway said that the news network should be confused with the Cavanaugh's conviction with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to prison in Pennsylvania's trial from three to ten years.
Conway also criticized the Senate Court Committee because this could not remove the former President Bill Clinton, who took his cabinet with oral sex and lied to the United States.
The review showed that Kavanaugh’o and Ford shared the United States society
The Americans don't care about Bretto Kavanaugh’o and his accused Christine's blasey Ford’s orders – the accusator says that the judge has sexually disappointed her when they were appealed.
As the fact that Ford or Kavanaugh’s lies, the numbers are almost covered: 38 per cent of the applicants claim that Kavanaugh’s probably or uncertainly lied by giving evidence, and 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
The Senator's Court Committee heard both countries when Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne'ai Feinstein with a complete accusation judge.
The pure letter and Ford and Kavanaugh said that they were ready to speak before the committee.
By providing evidence, Ford stated that there were 100 percent of the fact that at the beginning of the nineth decade, it was trying to enter Kavanaugh’s, not the other person.
A 51 - year - old woman in the emotional income language stated that she felt a civil responsibility, so she could not be silent.
"I am very afraid," she said.
“I am, because I think my citizen responsibility to deal with what happened to me when Bretta Kavanaugh and I learned in the middle school.”
Ford and two other women's accusations for sexual abuse, Kavanaugh's claimed that "never sexually shot anything in the middle school, college or any later."
“All as they could have tried to find something that would stop voting for my nomination, it does not matter how unrealistic it is or a lie, ” he said.
"This is the last minute of the latest smile."
The results of the consultations of the YouGov on 27 to 28 September, which have been discussed in 2607 people, have dismissed the opinions of the different parties: Democracy parties believed Ford (73%) and the Republic Kavanaugh’u (74%), despite the demonstrations of Ford, more than Kavanaugh’o, democratics (14 per cent, based on 11 per cent).
The word "Body Worlds", named "Dadáru Death", wants to be broken and demonstrated in its own word
When the Germans have found the plasting, the dead wants to be a part of his demonstration "Body Worlds".
Guntheris von Hagens found an innovative method that allows the demonstration of the law, the cow and organs in the world's decreased speech, disturbance and disturbance, and contrary values.
The man who was deadly sick in the year told women after death to plastize him so that he would become a continuous exposure in the "Body Worlds" show that this week will be opened in London.
“This will really be the end of his life.
Now I understand that I should do this because I'm expressing this recognition and love," Angelina Whalley said to the "The Observer".
She said that the man had given anxiety to what to do with his lawyer, and all the process will be stopped for a few years.
Raumens, nerves and arteries must be removed, and the body must be placed in silicone and placed in the appropriate situation.
"He said to me, "Anglena, it can heal me up to -25 Cells' steps for years, but then you'll have to join your hands, otherwise away."
So I can get the year, then I'll have to take it."
Then, in the most ideal case, he will connect to the show of London in the show of other bodies, in the time of fixed positions, with the arrow or playing cards.
Von Hagens listened to a road in the United Kingdom through the direct translation of British television (that was the first public floor in 170 years).
Body Worlds showed more than 47 million people worldwide since 1995.
The "Body Worlds London" recorder Peter Tabernal said to the "The Guardian" magazine that 100 percent of showing about 28,000 square feet were exposed to the dedicated people who "respected because they wanted to save lives, to light them and to help them see possible problems."
“We see and read so terrible things that we are deceived by death.
We will not avoid it, death is common to us all, and I think "Body Worlds" shows that it doesn't need to be afraid," said Tabernal.
Ronald's lawyers are appealing to the Court of Justice on the exemption of accusations
The Portuguese football star Cristian Ronald advocates said on five days that the German magazine, expressed “often unrighteous”, would state that Ronald was rejected in 2009, would be sent to the court.
One of Ronald's lawyers, Christian Schertz, stated that the article "Der Spiegel" was "unacceptable declaration of private accusations" and that he will by the rights of the reporting to his client.
The agency “Re¤s” sent a statement to the Ronald’s resident company “Gestifute” in response to the request to comment the article “Der Spiegel” published on the Internet on five days.
“Gestifute” did not answer specific questions about the content of the Deer Spiegel declaration which “Re” could not automatically be checked.
Deer Spiegel first announced the complaints on April 2017.
One of the most popular sports in the world, Ronald, wined five times the title of the best player in the world.
This February he passed to the Italian "Juventus" from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment "Der Spiegel".
The magazine states that the advocate of Kathryn Mayorga, which had been sentenced in La Vegas, was held on Monday 2009 in Las Vegas's hotel room, and that was the accusation of the Kathryn Mayorga advocate Leslie's Mark Stoval.
Staval told the journal that Ronald and Mayorga agreed not with the court.
Mayorga agreed to purchase a trust contract for Ronald paid 375 000 dollars.
Stavall did not immediately answer the Re·s' e-mails on comments, and Mayorga didn't return to the calling phone at home.
However, Stovall said to the Der Spiegel that he had submitted a civil dispute to cancel the contract of confidence.
The magazine Mayorga said that the contract was not involved, because she feels still the effects of the former nights before nine years.
"I've survived a serious crisis," she said, "Der Spiegel."
“And, the offence is more accused of accusation.
I'm accusing him and accusing me that I signed this."
Manufacturer business which ensures the independence of the persons
Are you ready to try "Self-Publishing 3.0"?
In the new Balab book that the Unilateral Union has published today on the "#pub3.0" website, it is explained in the first time how to connect to other business bodies, become independent and prevent the creation of the business.
Orna Ross, which is not the first time recognised in the publication of one of the 100 most influential people, will explain in the "Digital Book World 2018" in which bottles should be allowed by "Self-Publishing 3.0" methods.
“The trends of the conversion, .. the popular individual marks of goods responsible for mobile phones, together with numeric publications, create a well-being conditions for businesses,” Ross said.
However, these features can only be used for independent and creative thoughts and to knowing their powers that understand the value of intellectual property.
"#pub3.0" encourages creators to create several job sources through sites that create conditions for successful release and newspapers.
It may be involved in direct sales, prenumerated models, compatibility assistance, large floor models and other income sources, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"#pub3.0" is also encouraged to broadcast the book in various formats in which the auditor uses a widespread auditor by using the resources and other services.
The main goal of the "#pub3.0" is to consider changing thoughts and learning to manage its creation business so that the intellectual property, which is the most important property, would not be unexpectedly translated to another company, ­ specialized publishers or voluntary publishers.
According to Ross, it can increase their income, accuracy and impact, and these methods need to be interested not only in the number of age, but also on the dealers; it also stressed that the real freedom of the individuals (as others) is being ensuring commercial and creative.
Come on.
And its admonition is the best now for independent ones.
The book “Self-Publishing 1.0” approximately includes a computer authorisation and printing according to the signature.
Self-Publishing 2.0 Theme is the sale of books for readers and phones in online book sales.
Now begins a new, "Self-Publishing 3.0" era, in which self-subsequent students will be learned to start a warning and aware business.
The Union of independent qualities is the only worldwide non-fruit organization, which units self-employed books.
The objective of the Union is to develop self-employed engines, promote ethical activity, help the starting bodies to sell books and to consider creators to carry out a digital business that will ensure their independence.
The presidents of the Central Bank have warned the Governments of Italy concerning the planned deficit
When the Popular Government Plans had heard the deficiency costs in the next year, the Italian President and head of the Central Bank warned that the country's debt should be governed.
The Governing Party (opocynic movement of Five Stars and the right North) presented a proposal for the deficit of the 2019 deficit on the basis of which the deficit would aim at 2,4 per cent of the total internal product (BDP) and three times above the objective of the previous administration.
This report distorted the market on fifth-day and encouraged the sale of obligations and made a lower banking shares.
Furthermore, such plans should not be compatible with the European Union, implementing EU fiscal rules and monitoring as they are considered.
The President Sergio Mattarella recalled that, in accordance with the basic laws of the country, “the budget must be balanced and the duties are governed”.
"It's what we're going to do with our citizens," he said
The Ignazio Visco president of the Italian Bank in Central Italy said that it was not possible to continue to increase the debt of the country, which is of all the major economics of the European Union, and intends 131 per cent of the BDP.
“Italia must first provide public and private investments and govern and reduce the State debt”, said Visco, supporting the State knowledge agency Ansa.
“School must be decreased separately.”
The leader of the North and Vice-President Matteo Salvinis in Mattarella's speech replied that the debt would apply the terrible requirements of Brussels for the year.
"Remember, Mr President," said Salvinis in the statement.
"The State debt has been exposed to the European budgets for the year, and we finally consider plans and seek better future and growth."
Before speaking to Mattarella or Visco, the leader of the Five Stars movement Luigi Di Maio said that money would be brought back to humans from the budget, but added that the government does not contrary to EU or financial markets.
The Governing Party pressed with no group unrelated economic Minister June Three to agree with their planned deficiency expenditure.
The Italian newspaper claimed that Mattarella had undertaken Tria's unfair trial to maintain the budget deficit that would not be due to 2 per cent of the BDP.
The presidents of the country and the Central Bank do not affect the economic policy directly.
The President of the 77th century can reject the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Then the Parliament may again adopt an unchanged law and justifie it.
Official information: Indonezian conami's jutics expired diédéles bounds
The Indonesian Geo-Eagency rejected a warning about conamie after 34 minutes after his release, and later a worst landscape, sending a big boat to the north-east coast of the Sulavesien island, where hundreds of people died, and thousands remained without home.
Car rental after conamio Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
Over 7,5 baths of landscape and consomm, smoking about 1,500 km (940 km) from the city of Jacart to Pala, at least 384 people died.
On Wednesday, the attendants claimed that the numbers of people would probably grow.
On five-day, most people gathered at the festival in Pala, and they smoked a lot of six meters of the beginning.
The Geo’s Agency, BMKG, took criticism in the social newspaper on Sunday: many people discussed whether the warning about conamie was not rejected too early.
The Agency claimed that it sets a standard and decided to reject the warning in accordance with the most recent rubber of about 200 km (125 miles) from Pala.
“We have no monitoring data from Pala.
Thus, we should have taken a decision according to the data we had," said the BMKG head of the landscape and connamic center of Rahmat Triyon's.
The nearest victory, watching the changes of the sea, only defined, by its statement, the "inconsistent" of six metres (2.5 colo) and did not observe the large bounds at Pala.
“If we had a vineyard, look at Paul or get the data from there, the situation would certainly be better.
That's what we have to say in the future," said Triyon's.
According to the officers, the chimmy smoke Pala and the environmental ships at a rate of hundred miles per hour, but I don’t know whether it happened before the warning was rejected or later.
The lives will check on the road by seeking their members after conamium Palu, in Indonesia, on 29 September 2018.
"By the videos broadcast in the social newspaper, we believe that cunami had occurred before officially rejecting a warning," said Triyon's.
The greatest damage of 9,5 balls of land has occurred on the second day of the Caledonia in 2004 and has caused a great consomm, which begins by approximately 226 000 people on the Indian water border, 126 000 in Indonesia.
The town of Palu, in which 380 000 people live, is at the rocky winds at the north-east of the Slaveis Island.
According to the National Agency for Reduction of Consequences in Indonesia (BNPB), the town was distorted in 1927 and 1968.
According to the Oxford University Geo-Studier of Baptiste's Gomberto, the landscape should not have caused conami.
The roof of the five-day landscape has occurred because of the horizontal luxury — the combined techtonical border has caused horizontally, not vertically, as used for the conamies.

“RT World News”: German police officers who safeguarded Erdogan used a neonatic name as a code word
According to the local newspapers, hidden officers in East Germany, who kept the Turkish President Erdogan this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of a severely prolonged neonatic extremist.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Region stated that the criminal police in Saxon in East Germany investigated two members of the Electronic Anti-Terrorist Agency.
The men were intended to protect the Turkish President Recepto Tayip Erdogan during his long expected travel to Germany.
The representatives had to work hiddenly, therefore, in accordance with the protocol, the code name should be used.
They chose Uwe's Boehnhardt, a severely prolonged newsgroup, belonging to the Nationalsocialist Extremists Group (NSU), who killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and the German police officer at the beginning of this century.
The local newspaper reports that a wonderful code name was known when two police officers requested the authorisation to obtain internal documents necessary to comply with the tasks.
The officers delayed and rejected the police officers.
Petrica Kleine's first leader of Saxon's criminal police reacted to news.
He said that the decision to use the name of Boehnhardt was “the one who was the most stupid” and thus “of course ignored the responsibility and their neighbors”.
Roland Wilris, minister of the Internal Affairs of the Saxon, accepted this statement and decided to be called "in a disappointment, fearless and completely inappropriate".
The visit to Berlin on the five-day five days has caused a lot of contrary values in Germany.
The Kanclera Angela Merkel was criticized because he accepted the hand accused of adulterous authorism.
Markel stated that this visit was very important, "in the case of inconveniences, they need to meet personally."
The public first heard about the NSU 2011-17 when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his companion Uwe's Mundlas were found in the east Germany.
It seems that one of them was killed and then killed after an unexpected trial to appropriate the Bank in Eazenach.
The third member of the neonacy group was soon taken, the last alive remained in Beate'a Zschaepe.
On July, this year, the German Court decided to arrest her until he was captured for the murder of 10 accusations.
She refused to come to murder, but her lawyer said that the accused ones felt a moral offence because she did not try to stop murderers.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agencies grew a lot of critics.
Justicians, agencies, and some neighbors believe that the group had much more partners.
It also explained that the German Internal Review Agency, BfV, infiltrated many informationers in the NSU and continuously stopped investigating the killings, tests of killing and encouraging.
Musk takes out of the "Tesla" responsibility and will have to pay 20 million dollars in the Value Paper and Birge Commission
Elon Musk agreed with the United States Values Paper and Birge Commission, given it to the Court of Affairs on Twitter, which he said to make the Tesla privacy in the company.
The museum must be taken from the responsibility of the manager, and then the Director-General will remain.
The documents contain that Musk must be removed from the responsibility of the President of the Board of Tessa within 45 days and will be prohibited to return to this obligation for three years.
Moreover, he'll have to pay $20 million.
All started from Twitter's news that was overwhelming or quietly mistakes, so Musk will have to have an approving before or speaking of "Tesla" "in any form, but without any interruption, recorded in the social newspaper (e.g. "Twitter"), the company's website, the pressing and the calling investors.
The "Tesla" will have to pay more $20 million because it did not verify the Musk start "Twitter" messages.
The Commission of Values and Birge is charged by the Musk involving investors in the news on 7 August, Twitter, in which he said that he had found funds to make a "Tesla" private company, which would be worth $420 – therefore, the company's value papers were valued more than 10 percent.
The museum immediately rejected his words by saying that the Tesla would remain public, and the investors would be thrown up.
The Commission of Value Papers and Birge decided that the Moscow first statement was “injust and injustice, because they did not act in facts”.
Moscow himself explained that this error could be justified: after the meeting with the Saudi Arabia independent fund, he insisted that he had been forced to agree on funds.
It is reported that Musk and the Commission of Value Papers and Birges were approached to the higher trial – Musk would have rejected the position of the President for only two years and should not recognize the faults, but Musk refused this Agreement on Thursday.
On five-day, the price of the value papers of the Tesla was fallen, and most likely it changed its opinion and agreed with the more dangerous conditions.
However, in accordance with the new agreement, as the older, Musku is not required to recognize the offence for the error of investors.
Alexandria patriarch prepared to support the Canonic Church of Ukraine and encouraged the Orthodox to unit
Alexander patriarch Teo II supported the Canonic Orthodox Church of Ukraine, belonging to the patriarch of Maskva.
He replied to the division of the Russian Orthodox Church and the patriarch of Constantinopolis.
On Thursday, Theo II arrived in the city of Odessa in the south of Ukraine and met most of the church residences and hopes in Orthodox.
Alexandria patriarch is the most honourable orthodox hierarchy, which is only the ecological patriarch of Constantinopolis.
“I have come to tell you: don’t reply to Orthodox faith and canonic churches”, said patriarch Teo II.
Before visiting Odessa, he met with the metropolis of the Polish Orthodox Church, Savva, who also supported the Canonic Church of Ukraine.
It also encouraged them to prevent a number of conflicts in order to justifie the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
“We will always support those who seek Orthodox Units” promised Teo II.
The Orthodox Church recently experienced a great crisis after the decision of Constantinopolis patriarch to recognize the independent of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The recent belongs to Russian Orthodox Churchs, as well as Moscow patriarch.
Constantinopolis decided to send exarchs to Kiev, so violating the rule prohibiting one Orthodox Church to change to other matters.
Egzarchai are special patriarch residences, formally higher than the metropolite Onufriy, which is the main of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Maskva patriarch.
Maskva patriarchat wrongly reacted to the actions of Constantinopolis and rejected all the common church prayers and organizations of members, for which the Constantinopolis is managed or chaired together.
However, this decision suggests that Constantinopolis has been warned to take other anti-acts and that both churches have completely stopped the interruption.
Only one of the three churches in Ukraine is recognised by the church of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the patriarch of Maskva.
Most of Ukrainian spiritists recognize its authority, but the government always openly supported one of the separate churches — the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to Kiev’s patriarch of Kiev in the 10th year.
This religious movement has even a patriarch’s highlighted leader of Filarith, in order to recognize the official Orthodox Church, universal independence and integrity with the patriarch of Moscow.

The main ideas from Lavrov JT
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, invoked the Western on the "political and brutal force" and said that diplomacy should not be subjected to dictators and single sanctions.
The Ministry of the United States General Assembly said five days that some Western countries trying to maintain “the position of the world leaders themselves” without consciousness pressure to others.
He did not name specific countries, but he said that they used the "political chance, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for the self-employed ambition of the group of small countries.
Lavrova, who remained in the United States for the decade, said in the assembly that the diplomatic and deficiency culture and the single sanctions are applied without the approval of the United States.
The Minister stated that the sanctions applied to many countries are "injustified or ineffective" and recalled the blockage of the United States for many years of Cuba.
“But the story has not paid us anything,” Lavrov said, and added that “Western strangers have been willing to take the fault only if it is“very likely”.
We consider how often those unreverse offences have been justified by the disturbances and wars, such as the invasion in Yugoslavia in 1999, the invasion in Iraq in 2003 and the rest of Libya's cases in 2011."
Of course, Lavrova mentioned not all the west invasions and remembered the war of Syrian seven years as one of the recent cases.
Without obtaining extremist tests to translate the scheme, it could be lost throughout the country and opening parts to establish a "terrorist potential".
Lavrova has made the peace process of Estonia, which began together Russia, Turkey and Iran, and has said that this process has helped to prevent the way of the Islamic State (ISIS) and other groups who want to enter the whole Syria.
Now it is the most important to restore the places of the country's disappeared war and help refugees to return home safely.
Lavrova returned to the greater forces of war and said that the United States were created “to learn from the Second World War”.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recalled that in 2018, 80 years from 1938, the "wonderful" Treaty of Miunchen, Prague and the Great Britain agreed to allow the nationals to enact the part of the German inhabited in Czech Slovakia to be called Hitler.
Although the modern British Premier Neville's Chamberlain said that the Miunchen's contract “take peace for these times” has started war after year.
"Miunchen's expense" shows how it can lead to "socialism and international legislation", said Lavrov.
"The colonial era dihedate and the advocate must be helped to the history archive or swimming box."
The Maskva believes that the global problems of the world can be resolved by the dialogue, Lavrov said.
"If you have questions or questions, sit down and speak, disclose the facts, listen to your colleagues' arguments and try to compatibilize interests."

"Dragon" reduced the divorce when Arwell Robson received anxiety, and the security turned the other wheel once after 20 minutes, and the ballers gained a point.
The first half-hour's sign was running too quite peaceful: Glazgo's puzzle dealing with the "Dragon" line, then the judge from South African Stuart Berry's 22-minutes of the Hastings.

However, "Warriors" did not leave after accident – after four minutes they took the middle of the top and the "Dragon" center Adam Warren was hit by the door, thus gaining points, and later Joshas Lewis after opening the game with Robson.
Warriors quickly returned to the first position and the 54th minute after the fourth trial, the additional points were obtained when Huwas Jones moved to the right, and Hastings did not have to send a bottle (this was the third failure of four trials).
Glasga maintained the higher position and the fifth trial for a few minutes, Dunbar delivered it after the holidays with George'u Horne, and Hastings gained points.
Kebble's announced with the best sword, but Rennie's lived Hastings.
"They appeared to stop playing, but we were in the middle," said the trainer.
“He missed a few meters, but he was a throat, and he was still able to stop.
He's a good form and trust yourself."

In Latvia, the annual payment of work increased 71 per cent of the employees concerned and increased more than 11 per cent in our country.
In Estonia, the compensation of the employees has increased 13 per cent in this year.
A greater impact in the growth trends is the change of employees, since the workplaces are able to receive a much greater wage than at the previous workplace.
For those who have not changed the jobs in Lithuania in the last two years and have not been responsible, the annual recompense of 8,8 per cent was more frequent than payment and addments in other Baltic countries.
In Neighbouring Latvia, the annual expenditure growth of such employees was estimated by 3.6 per cent.
Estonia remains a leader in Baltic countries, not only as the majority of the employees are made for new but also for long-term employees.
Without change to workplaces, or responsibility, the most rapidly resulted: monthly - 6 per cent, year, counting the addeds - even 9 per cent.
According to the specialist of the compensation studies, such trends often depend on or goes with the common economic indicators of the country: the influence or the BDP at the level, their prognoses, the State monetary policy, which leads to market abbreviations.
For example, the prognoses about the future economic difficulty, the business encourages to be more careful and less invested.
Country sectors, such as information, plants, pharmaceuticals and farmers, can also develop the common capacity and reduce less changes.
Latvia’s greater educational burden
In comparison with the growth of compensation, it is important to develop different educational systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees depending on the payment of payments, even 31 or 34 per cent, which may be more interested to 42.4 per cent.
In Lithuania, the tariff of 24 per cent is in force, thus in the case of a higher growth in Latvia, the employees may be involving the same or even less sensitivity in Lithuania than in Lithuania.
In Estonia, a similar tax tariff is applied in Lithuania - 23,6 per cent, so we find the most favorable taxation of work force in the Baltic countries in this country.
IT area - most competitive distortions
In the data made by the investigation, the position of IT specialists remains between the best taxes in all Baltic countries.
The opposite situation in the small market is the market indexes of this area as less than one, so the employees are affected by less than the average market income.
In comparison with the previous year, the labour payment was quickly growing for engineering specialists with higher positions and risk management professionals.
The growth of such expenditure has not been covered this year, and some of the IT positions - a large number of organisations' security experts have increased even to 14 per cent.
In addition, the payment of work in the small market was almost not changed.
However, some companies have succeeded in restructuring the compensation systems, so the annual payment for premiums has increased about 2 per cent.
According to the payment specialists, the trend is noted that the growth of the payment is dictating and the most important aspect of the experts - the request of system analysis in the Baltic States continues to grow.

Gydy's claims that the white sugar is unnecessaryly modified - the misuse of salts can become destruction, diabetes, cancer and other diseases.
It should therefore be valuable to try to use it as less, therefore, that this product is added to many food products, even to the food.

Macron urges Europe to be born from Russia and the United States
The President Emmanuel Macron invited on Monday to create a "real European Ca" and to ensure an extent from Russia and even the United States
E. Macron, who urges the European Union to create a common power from its arrival to government, says that Europe needs to reduce the dependency of the American military power.
In recent times, he received a significant argument, after the President Donald Trump declared that Vashington would be removed from the Contract on Nuclear Power.
"We must be exhausted from China, Russia and even the United States," E. Macron said to the radio "Europe".
This is the first interview given to his radio at the start of May 2017 from the president's post of work.
"Why do I see the President Trumpas say that he takes away from the deep destruction contracts created after the nineth decade of Europe, which will be the primary victim?" said the leader of Prague.
The crise of the rackets has caused the outcome of non-strategic nuclear weapons in the end of the Milk War, and the United States has distorted the balistics in Europe.
This crisis was the key factors considered by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987 in the Treaty on the Mediterranean Nuclear Powers (INF).
"We will not deal with the Europeans, unless we are going to have a real European country," said E. Macron on the interview, on Monday evening in North-East Prague, to the president this week in visiting the places of the First World War before the end of this conflict, 100 years.
"When Russia, who is at our borders, has shown the possibility of being a threat, we need Europe, which is better wanting itself, and not just depends on the United States."
The manager of the European Union has become the main initiator to build a project for the establishment of the powers of nine European countries that are able to quickly create a common military operation, evacuation from the military area or to provide aid in case of civil disasters.
The Ministry of Democracy of these nine countries will first meet the detail in Paris on Thursday.
The European Union has also established a significant increase in its draft budget since 2021 and has been provided for for research and new technological developments for about 13 billion euros in seven years.
The EU's current budget for the development is not EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomares said that the E. Macron vision of the European community, which is a closely united Europe, is a difficult implementation.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad," he said to the AFP news agency.
- However, there is a different disaster between the European fighting, about which Emmanuel Macron, and reality - very large inconvenience between European partners."
Lukašenka in the NATO rackets: we're not idiots

The last week, Mr. Lukašenka said that Minsk and Maskva are looking for a suitable and unvaluable response to the Polish base and calling it to the President Donaldo Trumpo (Donaldo Trampo) for "Trumpo Fortu" (Fort Trump).
"Ok, we're worried about this.
If we say, in Poland, they are ready to leave millions of dollars to be dislocuted there... some Trumpo Fort, of course, we are not idiots and, of course, react to it," says Mr. Lukesenka, participating in the Miunchen Security Group's main discussion in Minske.
"I understand, with our main union, we consider how to answer all of this and how to find the relevant response to the minimum costs," he adds.
Western relations with Maskva have severely sent for Russia's 2014 Cryme Anexy.
Their connections also understood the role of Maskva in the conflict of Syria and the battle of the years in Great Britain, as it seems, the desire of Russian special services to introduce an ancient duplicate agent of Sergei Scripture in the paralyzing substance.
The attack between Moscow and Vasington has yet been appealed to Mr. Trump as it is planning to remove from the Contract on the Nuclear Arms Regulations of the Health War.
Russia warned that this step could destroy the world security system.

Mr. Gentville: for non-operating GPAIS business 90 million Eur
The Vice-President of the Committee on Environmental Environmental Affairs Simon Gentville states that the information system for Lithuania and importers may be paid at the end of the year for approximately 90 million euros.
"After the end of the year and the GPAIS system, the systemic processing sector crisis becomes a real scenario.
It is not officially stated that notices which confirm the process of relief waste issued by only 1% from the proposed transfusion tasks," reports Mr Gentville.
On 7 November, the family initiates an immediate meeting of the Committee on Environment, which is intended to discuss the situation, to disclose how the functions of this programme are not effectively implemented, and how the Ministry of Environment intends to address the problem.
"Unless the necessary legislative or legislative amendment initiatives, the importers and importers are risked and re-acquired of significant taxes for environmental violations at the end of the year," said Gentville.
It considers that the failure and failure of the GPAIS accounting system signals a serious crisis in the processing sector of waste management that can be faced with the Metral crisis.
Notice of tasks
In order to not affect parts of the undertakings of the deadlines set out in 2018, some experts shall also be warned.
In view of the indicators of the interruption of the first half-year packs of the organisations, specialists confirm the reason to be concerned that parts of the organisations may not be able to arrange the amount of relief residues necessary to 2018-year.
For that reason, the company may not have been able to use an easier to pay the payment of the payment for the payment of the payment for a certain amount of their markets in the year.
The VJ reported that two of the three currently operating organisations were rejected, and one does not give any comments.
The General Director-General of the Green Point, Pocius, the Organization of the United States, said that at least formally it would be the effect of the tasks, depends on whether the problems of the system of information on the depth, packaging and waste accounting system (GPAIS) will be completed.
The "Green Point" plans that this year will be able to influence all types of packaging tasks, except glasses.
Although the "Worm Point" task will not be affected this year, the organization will request the members to deal with the offences that occur.
Experts of the benefit of food bupones
In planning for the government to share cookins in food products and in order to promote the trade business of farmers or farmers, experts are concerned about the benefits of such news.
They agree that a new system will create an additional bureaucratic crash.
Marius Dubnik, manager of the Tax Commission of Lithuania, states that the bupones are alive and that the problems will be lost, and the Government should focus on the increase in human income.
"The system seems pretty strange and likes to be taken from older leaders.
If you want to help the public get something or more overcome power, we need to deal with all the ability to increase people's income, and people themselves have to leave buying on one or on another sale vessel," BNS said Mr Dubnik.
Like him, the Government, by offering food bupones, would make less income for people receiving.
"Of course, we, this government, have given you a wheel, and be pleased.
This calls as some anti-elective promises, where they want to make their writing very clear," an analysis said.
It also increases the administrative burden, as it claims to carry out what and how it allows them to deal with the need.
The first economy of the Bank Neryus Machiul says that with one instrument to achieve both objectives - to support small income in the lives of small and small businessmen - would not overcome.
"If this is supported to small enterprises, the differences in prices and life can be purchased in smaller sales markets, this is the difference of prices from the State from the budgetary funds.
This is then supporting business but not aid for living," said Mr. Machiul.
It believes that such systems would probably not have a significant economic impact and would in principle not change competitive situations of small sales, but would, in contrast, create an additional birocratic nausea and can distort the arrival of new market participants.
"I think that this would be a very birocratic instrument with large administrative costs, and that it would also be very uncomfortable for life, they should buy no larger sale vessel with a higher asortiment nearly home, but seeking several specialized sales with less asortiment," said the economicist.
As it is, the bupones in other countries are used when the volume of goods or services is limited and should be granted to all of them equally, or to some social group.
Then they are living for free and can be released to food.
According to Mr. Mačiul, they are also used in the labour market by providing provisional tax facilitations to undertakings by working long-term unemployed, or for example former prisoners.
This practice, Mr. Machiul, was also successfully applied in Lithuania.
The Premier Saul Skverneel said that the Government’s consideration would help the most poor humans to increase competition, promote small trade operators or farmers.
The Prime Minister Skirmant Malinausk BNS on Sunday said that the greenhouse is most oriented to farmers and businesses, and the purchasers with buyes could receive 20-30 per cent.
In its statement, the quantity of bupones would be limited so that agricultors could not be able to use evil.
Tell him, 3-5 bupones would be allowed to man for 10-15 euros per month.
As it is, even though funds are not provided for in the State budget, but it could be financed from this source, possibly by the European Union funds.
"Not all that is currently planned or unintained in the budget will be finally, but it will still change Seime, so it can be funds from one line transferred to another, and from the ministers may change funding things.
It is always a priority currency that would be resolved - or something to refuse, get another additional income source and similar," said Mr. Malinausk on Monday.
As long as it is decided about the scope and when the news can be applied.
