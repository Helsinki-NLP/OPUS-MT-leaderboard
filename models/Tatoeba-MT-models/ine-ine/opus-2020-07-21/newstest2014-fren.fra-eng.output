Spectaculary "wingsuit" above Bogota
The Jhonathan Florez sports shot on Thursday from a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
A wingsuit team (a hedge combination) passed 160 km/h above the Monserrate sanctuary, higher than 3000 meters, where many baths were gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While the United States road network planners have difficulty to find the money necessary to repair the auto-out infrastructure in decrept, many are those who interview a solution in the form of a small black box fixed above the board table of your car.
The equipment, recording all thousands of parking by a car and transmitting information to the officers, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to Washington and in the Governing Boards of Planning to maintain the obsolete financing system of the main American roads.
The sector generally without interest in the planning of big axes has soon caused a strong encouraged debate and moved aliens.
Freedoms have joined groups of →logists to press the government to use the small boxes to keep the track of the thousands you will park, and possibly from the road you are on, and then use the information to edit a project of tax law.
The Tea Party is attached.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresss its concern regarding the protection of private life.
And while the members of the Congrès are not able to agree to know whether to continue, several States have not been expected.
They are looking for how, during the next decade, they can pass to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of thousands of parcourus.
Thousands of automobilists have already shiped these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for a experimental wire.
This is really vital for our nation.
"It is not as if we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director-General of Southern Calibration of Governments, which provides that the State begins to record the thousands of parking by each California car from 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
It's here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund, financed with the taxes paying the Americans to the pomp, is financially secure.
The Americans are buying so much as before.
Cars can park more than thousands with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18,4 cents per gallon, has not increased since 20 years.
Political men are able to increase the tax, even 1 hundred, while the prices of the extent are high.
Lee Munnich, a specialist of transport policies to the Minnesota University, said: "The tax on the extent is simply not sustainable."
His State recently made trackers on 500 cars to test a thousand payment system.
"This is the most logical alternative to long-term," he said.
Wonks calls this for the costs of use at kilometre.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the freedoms of the citizens, since taxes could be used to conduct habits in order to reduce combustion and gas emissions, for example.
Californian planners are interested in the system because they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the ambitional laws of the State on climate discharge.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), President of the Committee on Transports of the Representative Chamber, stated that he also considered it as the most sustainable alternative.
The Free Market Partys of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying a thousand drivers.
"It is not just a tax in a large black crowd," said Adrian Moore, President of the Policy on the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they are gained.
The movement is also supported by two American ancient Secretarys in Transports who, in a report of 2011, encouraged the Congrès to go on the way of payment for thousands.
The American Senat approved a 90 M$ pilot project last year that would have brought about 10 000 cars.
However, the Chamber's presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural issuers representing electors who have to take a lot of thousand every day to return to their work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several countries and large cities make progress.
The most determined is the Oregon, which mobilized 5 000 leaders to carry out the most important experience in the country.
These carriers will quickly pay to the State of Kilometry costs instead of taxes on the extent.
Nevada has already implemented a pilot project.
The city of New York looks for one.
I'Nois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in countries far away, is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) study how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where approximately 50 volunteers had recently equipped their car from a vehicle, the leaders were concerned that the government could follow their smaller facts and gestures.
“ The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of things are a big problem, ” Alauddin Khan said, who guides the strategic management of performance at the Nevada Transport Department.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on his site: “It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into entire location devices. ”
It is not necessary to build a large and comprehensive infrastructure that will be inevitable to keep the records of the people's daily and coming.
Nevada is a part of some states that are now going to find a barrier that allows the State to know how many thousands park a car, but without knowing the place or the exact time.
If we can do that, Khan's got, the citizens will be more too.
The research of this area has brought some State agencies to call for a small start-up in California called True Mileage.
In the origin, the company was not intended to help carriers paying taxes to States.
She was trying to carry out on the high market of car assurance, where the drivers would pay according to their milestone.
But the devices that it tested have pulled to the planners of the large axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information downloaded p.d. by modem.
"The people will be more willing to do this if you do not record their speed and not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director-General of True Mileage.
Great errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are less honourable means and less intrusive methods to process.
In the Oregon, planners are trying to experience by offering different cars.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose to have no apparatus, prefering to pay a forfaite based on the average number of thousands of parkings by all the residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to unbelieving citizens by allowing equipment to make it more, rather than enough.
In New York, transport responsibles are trying to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay the stationary costs, to provide a "payment to the drive" and to create a data record on real-time speed from other drivers that cars could be used to avoid the embustment.
"The cars would be encouraging to participate on the basis of the benefits that the system offers to them," a document on urban amendment stated.
Some transport planners, however, ask if all the debate on the payment of a milestone is not just a great divergence.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission of the San Francisco Bathroom area, the responsibility states that the Congrès could very simply manage the highway Trust Fund's failure by increased taxes on the extent.
A single or annual additional tax may be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on other vehicles whose vehicles do not consume much deficiency, so everyone pays its right part.
"It is not necessary to take a radical surgery when we simply need aspirine," Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and business at the committee said.
If we do this, hundreds of million automobilists will be concerned about the protection of their private life and a number of other things.
David Bowie: four inedicts in listening
The musician hasn't been surprised this year.
From The Next Day, issued in January, he concocked a luxe edit for 4 November, with several inedits.
Four have already gone on the Toilet.
The announcement of the presentation of a new album of David Bowie had left everyone.
On his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would come out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Reality, date of 2003) and too rare public appearances, the musician proved that we could still count on it to make the pop scene shintilining.
A party for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke thus planned to edit this album on 4 November.
For the occasion, he concocked a real festival for his fans.
This redition, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, indirect study sessions and releases, and a DVD containing the four already developed clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three songs in the Deluxe edit, five songs specially devoted for the opportunity, and two releases.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful coffre in a video.
There is each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: photos and pockets, a book to share its own initiatives, a book with words...
And, especially, he gives a pre-go of his new Atomic title, typically in the vineyard of The Next Day, with guitars very before and a rock election rock well-controlled.
Inedicts already listen to
But Atomica is not the only title to devote his charmes.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the toilet.
The Informer is a double-face: an anxious intro before a horse that progressively slow down to leave a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, or even to Gravity?
With this enjoyed title, the song → in any case in its element when he has no more feet on earth.
Space Oddity, on the side, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The riffs of guitation, sending, want to leave the Earth.
Bowi's in any case fun to play the cameon with these titles: tour to informant tour, man at the border of a fusy, potential martian...
He dissimulates and reveals simultaneously, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, including with his persons Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder that he has a mask at hand in the photography of the campaign The Invitation to Traveling, of Louis Vuitton Mark, whose new face is involved.
It will appear in one of their publications, distributed from 10 November.
The Defense Minister, Rob Nicholson, insisted on saying that the wounded soldiers were not summonly released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civil life.
Appealed by the Liberals and Neo-Democrates to the Common Room, Mr Nicholson assured that before their release, the following military members have a transition plan with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and no of them is released before being ready, he said.
Delegators accusate the government of volunteer to economy money by not allowing the vulnerable military - which do not respond to the "University of the Service" rule of the Army requires that the staff be able to perform a number of different tasks - to achieve the 10-year acceptability period required for retraite performances.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by the Canadian Presse, including the one of a soldier released last Friday.
Caporal David Hawkins, a reservist in London, Ontario, reached the post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to remain a year more to be able to receive a completely indirect retraite.
His case occurred after the captain Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary committee, last month, that he had been moved to the outcome before he was ready because he did not respond to the universal rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins highlighted that a soldier could be prepared for, with plans and consultations, but that was totally different than the desire to leave the hangs.
"I said to them that I was not ready," he said during an interview with La Canadian Presse Thursday.
I asked for months if there was a way to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major battles in Afghanistan, the army determines the breadth that it can give to the wounded soldiers who want to stay in the camps, but who are not capable of fighting.
According to the current rules, Greekly hurt soldiers have up to three years to restore.
If they do not respond to the criteria for the deployment in the foreign, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to the Parliament indicates that 199 of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons have not reached the duration of service required for retraining performances.
The liberal portfolio of ancient fighters, Jim Karygiannis, requested the reintegration of Caporal Hawkins on Thursday, while the neo-democrate Jack Harris recalled the immediate end of "the honest practice".
Disney placed on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and divertising group Disney decided to privilege tablets to its own TV chains for the next outcome of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from 24 November on the watchdisneyjunior.com website or through its application for phones and tablets.
Its world launch on Disney group chains was only planned in 2014, detailed by its Division Disney Junior.
The animated design, for children of 2 to 7 years of age, rays the aventures of the chat of Callie, sheriff of a city of the West American, where it makes the order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two stories of 11 minutes.
"Interpretation with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, the president loaded digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the Quote.
This type of experience comes into the way Disney's efforts to "extende the life of its series and build new relationships with its public through digital platforms that are more important," he said.
A weekly study by Common Sense Media shows an explosion of the use of mobile equipment by young children in the United States: 38% of the less than 2 years have already been used by a tablet or a phone, and 72% of the less than 8 years ago, against 10% and 38% ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of America's monitoring
Edward Snowden, the American Information Service Designer, said that he was willing to go to Berlin to witness before the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide responses on their activities.
The German President Hans-Christian Strobele met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he benefits from the asylum right to discuss his witnessing in Germany.
In a letter that the lawyer presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts has been positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a fleet and seeks to penal political talks against which it is impossible to defend. ”
However, the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could convince the American government to leave the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint submitted by the American Justice Minister, it is accused of spending and flighting of goods of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, minister of the German Interior, said on the Internet Time: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to the German responsibles, we will make it possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany have been tested after complaints which NSA had sent on to listen to the phone phone of the German Channel Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the lawyer who managed the Parliamentary Group to monitor foreign secret services, indicated that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without put it in danger and completely destroying relations with the United States," it was necessary to benefit.
Mr. Strobele, Mr. Vert German, made a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit in Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strobele said that Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he should be assured that he would be in the "security" there, the lawyer said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had made an "severe and sustained" persuasion campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the world's reaction to " my political expression act".
The citizens of the whole world and the highly responsibility – including the United States – thought that the revelation of an unexplainable permanent monitoring system was useful.
The letter provides cooperation with the German authorities “if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable abonneds could have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and recently the video service on request Netflix via their television in a future that does not be so remote.
The Cogeco branch indicated that she was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of her users.
"This will allow us to valuate more confidential interfaces and more options," explained the President and head of the Cogeco direction, Louis Audet, interviewed.
Cogeco Cable thus embossed its competitors, such as Bell, even if the Cogeco branch has no specific date yet in what the new platform has been handled.
"You must adapt and change or resist the change and fail," Mr. Audet highlighted.
The final goal remains to offer tools to which our customers do not have access.
The Rogers telecommunications gender has already stated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, could be regulated.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be discussed with some major carbo distributors so that its service is available through their distribution platforms.
The Cogeco and Cogeco Cáble also welcomed the announcement made by the Government Harper during its talk of the Trone on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force chamber and satellite television providers to provide customers the opportunity to pay card services.
"This is about two and a half years ago we say that the idea of forced consumers to buy important strings, it doesn't work," said Mr. Audet.
However, it is hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio Diffusion and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will take place on interesting recommendations.
"There will be a new form of reference from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy in the field of television," said Cogeco.
The CRTC has conducted consultations to the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the next time.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that a net benefit of 43.8 million to the fourth quarter was recorded, or 82% by action.
It is a recycling compared to the net benefit of 44,9 million, or 83 million by action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montréal explains this recycling by costs of abortion related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco gained in 2012 the Atlantic Broadband carbo distributor, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after that which had failed in Portugal.
In December last, the Montreal Society also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As regards Cogeco's income, they experienced a growth of 41.5% at the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main branch, Cogeco Cáble, was 43.9 million, or 90 → by action, in a number of 45.7 million, or 93 million by action, from the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable income has progressed by 45% to reach 470,4 million.
The company lost 15 237 clients during the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 financial year, the number of Cogeco Câble clients increases 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about seeing the number of fluctuating clients of this kind.
For me, this is not the change of trends, he observed.
It varies from a quarter to another with a very living competition.
Heavy in bowl products
The horse meat was deceled in boxes of bovine products, sold by two small British distribution teachers, announced today the loaded food hygiene agency.
Routine tests showed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the heads Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained the Earth DNA from 1 to 5%.
"As the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not be present in the product," explained the British Agency.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooking plates extended in Europe at the beginning of the year, after tests made in Ireland.
According to the reviews of the European Commission, France was the most touched country by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only bovine.
A trip between two vehicles made four hurt, early Friday, on the road 131, in Lanaudière.
Soon before 4 hours, a carman who was in north direction, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost the control of his vehicle and gained a car coming in the other direction.
The four employees of the two vehicles were hurt, but they were not afraid of their life.
The employment was returned to the normal at 6 hours, Friday.
Frontier Airlines intends to pay hand baggage
Frontier Airlines intends to pay up up to $100 to passengers who carry hand baggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines intends to start paying up to $100 for a hand baggage and $2 for a café or a soda, although in its Friday announcement, she indicated that passengers could be able to carry out the unopened canet with them at the flight downstairs.
The new hand baggage costs relate to the broken sacks in the higher level, so the small sacks installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said that she would pay $25 if the costs were paid forward and $100 if the travelers would pay only once at the shipport.
The Frontier portfolio, Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 were planned to encourage travelers to pay the costs forward.
“ We don’t want to pay this price, ” she explained.
Aeroplane companies began to pay the first and second baggage recorded in 2008.
The passengers who were trying to avoid these costs were put as much as they could in hand-range baggage in the higher levels, so there was often no more place in these events.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers transport less than things to board.
O'Malley said that these new costs will not really need to collect money.
It is to make the most reliable clients of Frontier that it becomes more difficult to find the place in the higher areas.
The passengers who buy their billet on the site of the air company will not be paid.
Thus, a passenger who makes the cow to a Frontier ship gate could carry a sack free, while the next person in the kitchen could pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's registration site and procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before they arrive to the door.
Frontier's hand baggage costs will not be applied before the sea, although no date has been fixed.
The passengers often rush about baggage costs and other costs, but air companys love them.
They believe that the costs of maintenance of baggage are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people in Wall Street view the baggage costs as a sign that proves that aircraft companies pay enough to cover the air travel cost after years of loss.
However, many of them have not touched the baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first baggage costs three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such costs is the Hungarian Wizz Air company, stated the consultant with Jay Sorensen Air Air Company, which follows nearly the additional costs.
In a report of December 2011, he estimated that the costs of the hand of the Spirit were reported 50 M per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines frame, recently traveled on the Spirit and asked what he would find at the boat door when passengers would discover the costs of hand-handed baggage imposed by the company.
"I have never seen a so fluid shipment procedure of all my professional career," he said.
I was attracted to see teeth grinces and a bathroom to stretch at the door.
The plane was full, said he, “the passengers are combined to the board at the speed of the light”.
Frontier also makes as Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can carry the unopened cane with them, and those who take the coffee can be reserved freely.
It will always distribute water freely.
US Airways later tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after the passengers were complained and there was no other large airport company followed.
The decision of the Frontier to pay hand baggage costs when passengers do not buy their billet directly with the aircraft company is its last effort to encourage customers to go to his website.
Aeroplane companies pay online travel sales as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each sale cash.
This encouraged all aircraft companies to encourage passengers to buy directly to them instead of addressing a online traveling agency.
Frontier, however, went far far away in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half thousands of loyalty to customers who bought their billet through a online travel agency.
Wednesday, she reduced the thousands of 25 per cent prices on a travel.
Thus, a Frontier travel of 1.000 miles buyed to a online travel agency would be allowed to win 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat forward only if they buy their ticket directly on the frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful customer in its city of origin, Denver, but its activity recovers and she loses money.
Income has fallen by 9 % and its flight capacity has decreased by almost 13 % during the first quarter, the financial results of his mother's company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic tried to recover Frontier's funds by selling the air company.
NSA makes a "internal error" and not information pirates for its website's panel
The National Security Agency working in the shadow stated that it was a bug that caused the panel of its public site for a few hours, not hackers such as some have said it online.
"NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight because of a internal error occurred during a planned update," the spinner agency stated in a email statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The attachments to which the panel was due to a distributed service deni attack [DSD] are false.
Before this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been in panel for at least 6 hours, and some users can't always access the site.
In the past, a NSA portfolio indicated to ABC News that the internal network of the Agency was not "in all" compromises.
No classified information is in danger, explained the password.
At least one online hacktist group claimed to be responsible for the NSA site's panel by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks are intended to install a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site is removing.
Cybertactic is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to enter into the internal network of the system.
The NSA, a long time called No Search Agency, was found under the fire of projectors and criticized during the last months after a wave of evidence on its large national and foreign communication monitoring programmes, which are part of the secret files of the NSA furnished by the former consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing conflict around the Agency has caused many speculations which the incident of this night was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed his doors on Thursday in Montréal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that had the building sold it to promotors who would transform it into student residences.
Three hundred fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not yet found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Workers came to meet employees directly at the place, individually met employees to evaluate their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the regional director of the work relations of the Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The closure of Delta is involved in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was owner of that bathroom had choices to do.
Or he re-invested in the bathroom to continue to operate it, so there were tens of millions of investments while competition is very fair, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Whether he sold it to someone else and that was what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, the Title of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM Scientific School.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the next months, such as Crown Plaza who will become a residence for elderly people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects that totalize nearly 600 rooms will see the day of this two years.
For Titan's PDG, "the Goodyear Amiens Building Project starts with zero employed"
After casting the epoch with failures in January for the partial recovery of the Goodyear of Amiens-North site promised to closure, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of the American Pneumatician Titan, is now ready to save 333 jobs on the 137, which account the busy.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Research, had already announced it on Monday 21 October.
After refusing to buy the carrying project in January, you will come back today.
You have spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "soi-discent ov" which "works three hours a day" and "founds" syndicates by means of the CGT.
We don't understand this face.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, it's a charming young man who's trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when we work in other countries eight hours handicap France.
In India, China and many other countries, 10 to 12 hours a day are working.
But I have no prejudice on France.
What I see is a business that produces good agricultural pneumatics, has good equipment, is well used and has spaces to increase.
Why does Titan need this business so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this business.
But with a right price and the competent workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure, Goodyear had offered the salaries a good department, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan's buying Goodyear's closed machine.
Thus, Titan could deploy machines to Poland or to any other EU countries who still have its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens tool with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan accepts recruiting them among the about 1.200 current salaries of Goodyear.
So, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment to Titan before trying to bring the CGT to the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear are going to make an agreement on all employees.
So there will be no more employees in the machine.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he wants a four-year guarantee.
But, as I said to you, the CGT and Goodyear must be agreed on department refunds.
If all salaries accept them, the purchase project of the machine starts with zero employed.
How can we give employment guarantees when there is no more employee on the site?
If Mr Montebourg reaches that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the tool, we have the intention to stay in the North Amiens-North over four years.
The benefit of Bombardier in low, while delivery and aircraft orders
Bombardier Inc, a canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent of its net benefit on Thursday, under the pressure of decreasing orders and air supply during the third quarter and contractual problems in Trains division.
Bombardier, based on Montreal, has no longer provided flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft or information that allows to know whether the airplane will respect its ambitious commercial service calendar before September next.
After the inevitable flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the last stole only three times, and then the question was asked to know if the test phase was in a good way.
The results were not at the height of the previsions and the course of action was 8% at the Toronto Bourse.
Cameron Doerksen, analyzed in the National Bank Financial, has decreased its notation on Thursday, which has “performance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential of breathing during the next trimester or the next two trimestres.
"Although the decrease of air supplys has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profitable margin in the Transport Division," Cameron Doerksen said in a note to the clients.
We think that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft and as long as the flight test programme will be advanced.
However, if no new mandate is made in the next months, we expect that the market becomes more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries airport family will be able to catapult it in the underground segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first trial aircraft was released in March and was first enveloped in September after the late months.
But the number of closed orders for the CSeries aircraft is modest until now at the height of 177. It is expected that potential buyers expect the results of the flight tests to validate the company's statements on energy efficiency and the potential of economics of the new line plane.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and commitments to buying with 15 clients and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and leader of the direction, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 orders closed before the first aircraft's commercial service.
The leaders also assured the analystes and media on Thursday indicating that the programme was advanced to the calend.
"The test plane has not remained in the longer than the planned ground," Mr. Beaudoin said during a telephone conference, and it has been planned for tests on the ground and software updates during the time of the aviation stop.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to proceed to a first flight and to provide a period of update, and that is what we did.

Repetitive Feux: a Member requests Brigitte Grønels' demission
The draft Brigitte Grønels of "relifting" of the signalization feet bottles in Brussels does not please everyone.
For the remembrance, the Brussels Ministry of Public Travels and Transports launched this Thursday in Brussels, a test project consisting of 16 holes of signalization of the region to yellow and blue colors in Brussels.
The goal is the same as "increasing security" and "Brusselly identity".
The idea is, at the end, to repeat all Brussels signalization fires, for a estimated cost of approximately one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the Minister is "very cool," -- the Bruxelous President Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of the "flamingization" of the capital and requests the "demission" of Brigitte Grønels.
"Unfortunately expense of the money of the Brusselslois in the relief operations of the brands of the Brussels region, Brigitte Grønels continues its flaming operations of the Capitale," Mr. De Bock inquired in an appealed.
According to her yellow-manga-norge taxi, she finally repeated herself in yellow-blu-sweet-based Brussels pools.
According to the lawyer, there is now no "more visual continuity difference between Flandre and Brussels".
The Brussels deserves better than seeing their silver spent by a CD&V minister who self implements the NVA programme.
It's a big time to stop the Flander's horse.
"To remember, Brigitte Gøels was chosen only with 2 245 votes or 0.5% of the Brussels!", concluded Mr. De Bock.

Five years ago, my father was away from the world of living people.
At the beginning I bore his death, I talked about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or I didn't know how I should continue to "frequently".
There is no receipt, a way of employment to pass the wall of the inside and find his feet.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was conducting.
Once again, a sweet wake up in full night to watch his hour that doesn't leave me anymore, put on the night table.
It's the picture of my smileful father who's combining me in my guests daily.
Our mother left us after his struggling against cancer.
It's at least what I thought on the day I found his empty body, crished on this hospital bed to frozen draps.
Similarly, his funerals were a focused glacial addiction around the lightweight of the sandals that would cover its circle.
I thought she was gone.
Soon, by small daily or evening apparitions, a little tired, a little scared, she quickly came back to my mind, growing into the wound and while she replaced her place in the landing of my thinking that believed in grief.
And then she appeared to me by devoting my own faces that I hadn't yet imagined, hidden by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had nothing to lose my mother's person but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnated this person during her life.
By moving, this woman had perfectly his life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and full.
This distance from my life's way remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I didn't tell my father, "inside as outside" looks he.
We've always told me.
I never believed it at that time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he becomes old, sick.
There, I didn't fear him anymore and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
During a long time, he joined me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was bad...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at my hands, preparing my body to him.
But it was never incredible.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my intimity.
It's been a long time, and one day he's gone.
Finally, it was comfortable and comforting to be understanded, encouraged, advised.
I don't know anymore who said that the dead people were not forgotten but inevitable.
My parents are no longer, but I always feel them near me.
Every event, every instinct of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they say? what would they think? what would they do?
I always dream of them, maybe not all nights, but several times a week it's sure.
I am often dreaming of the last instincts I have to share with them before it is too late, just there's always a thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I am often worried when it comes to me, and I feel deeply their absent.
Some dreams bring me to the contrary and enter into my story and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The guard of my echography, where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was wake up, I was getting out of bed, my father was looking at me on the pair, and he smiled and rejoiced that I was waiting for a little boy.
On the next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to mean he shared with joy what would happen to me.
And, of course, it was a little boy in my neighborhood.
I loved to share this time with him and I'm pleased to tell this common memory v' after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother died after a cancer.
One year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
It's the shock that his disappearance caused to be at the young bachelier I was at the time.
Despite all, I've made my deal quickly enough.
But she continues to influence my life, especially in the moments where I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Teach the Arabic and interest me in the Middle East, in order to make it a master in a large school, there were no anodines choices.
In fact, I often talked Arabic in my childhood, and talked about Marokko, where she had been in the past decades - before she rejected France at the time of independence.
The values she inculcated to me are always present, even though I can think of how she wants me to act at a given time.
It's the same for my attitudes: I'm trying to be at the height of the generosity and the rightness of the spirit that was a believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a well-servant, a salvable spirit.
I see his eyes put on me.
My mother's been dead for nine years ago.
Death after you talked to me on the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, weeping themselves alone, anywhere, anywhere, in insolite places, unconscious moments.
Then, the time was deceived.
It was only the missing, this empty without response, that need of her, to trust me, to assure me of her doctor's hair.
Yet, she's here, silent presence, she's here and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his anxiety eyes put on me, I see the cears that lower his look, the ridles around the lips that cross the cigarettes, the most that mark the front of the days of anxiety.
My mother took my face and she looked at me every morning in my sight.
And every morning, I'll turn my eyes back.
My wife and mother of my 3 children are killed by a cancer at 43 years.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, then we had little to reap, and to say his name is no more tabou but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to her in the crown of the night when the absent does too bad, she's invited to my dreams when the moral is a little reached.
We feel wearn and protected in difficult times, the time time time makes us realize how much she was the leader of orchestra and we try to stay in the way she tracked us.
If a man loved you very strongly, the absent can't distract you from the heart and memories.
In a certain way, lovedness becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father on 22 to 2008 from the suite of a cancer of the amiant.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't attend her inhumanisation and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his own, I always ask if my actions are in accordance with his vision of things.
In addition, I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in a contrary sense, I don't sleep it, and I always ask what he's gonna think about it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way to be or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a little like a alter-ego, it didn't need to talk between us.
Shortly, he's here every day.
I feel his presence, and that makes me happy.
It's about 30 years that my husband was dead at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was six years old.
The big damage that then envahieed me was sure he's still close to me, but he's still close to me.
Very often he "scars" in my dreams in a so precise way, so alive as at the wake I am still worse to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was good, I told her no, he answered me "I'm down" but from a very real voice that I was wakened up in surrounding, anxious, and I stuck the hair lamp by looking everywhere, convinced that he would come.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I get back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all rooms, I feel his presence, and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world, I wouldn't leave this house where we were happy, or his spirit lives with me.
I've been 58 years old, I've always been alone since he's gone, he's and will remain the love of my life.
I'm trying to determine that I'm social with a responsibility officer, I'm laughing and sing, I'm going, I'm grandmother, I'm full of friends, but my heart and my heart belong to him, and I'm never talking about him except with my son, and I'm never going to the cimetary.

The Cocainan lawyer who informed a drug parliament of a police investigation was arrested
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the Master of crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would not be revealed at the great day
It was condemned to a three-year prison penalty by the Liverpool Assessment Court
A large defense lawyer, who had informed a drug parliament of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would not be revealed, was condemned at three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the Master of the crime Neil Scarbrough on investigations on drug traffic activities after it was compromised because of its habit of consumption of cocaine.
The lawyer, who was referred to as “Bash” and was considered as a “primary dossier”, was arrested with him in 2011 after the police's audience operations addressed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a procedure in relation to the traffic of drugs.
Police officers, 32 years old, repeated Sarborough, putting three cocaine sacks at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, La Posashire, while he attended a dinner from Barreau with conferences.
The investigations discovered that Ditta was a regular consumer of this class A drug after tests showed cocaine tracks in his hair, on his portfolio and credit cards.
In a period of eight months between January and 2011, he was illegally looking for information on the arrest of two men for the Scarborough account and one of its associates.
The four suspects were at the same time monitored by the police in the framework of a major investigation on heroin and cocaine trafficking in the compositions of La’ashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Avec 32 other men, they were then imprisoned after the police took heroin and cocaine for a amount of 1,5 million, and more than 200 000 £ in species during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the stakeholders because he feared that its toxicity would not be revealed at the great day.
Today, at the Court of Assessments of Liverpool, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors Cabinet in Blackburn, has been disgraced after being recognised due to two judges of justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted the property of cocaine during an audience.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police asked about Scarborough discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Dyta in February 2011.
Two researchers followed the suspect and found it in the Ditta home and placed drugs, pure to 60%, under the lawyer's pubs in a black golf.
Shortly after the depth, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at Ewood Park footsteps, the Blackburn Rovers Club.
The lawyer returned to him, discovered drugs, and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular cocain consumer after tests showed tracks of this class A drug in his hair, on his portfolio and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine, and he said he had spoken to the drug trafficker because it was his customer and was valuable that their discussions were subject to a "local privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta collected his portfolio and tried to retrieve several credit cards, but they were all inserted and a hair sample was taken to him.
In a questionnaire, he stated that he had a office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that customers calling him to him for legal issues.
But the Court heard witnesses which he called major actors in the drug trade, including some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them what investigators were at warrant.
The prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone needs to know that it is not to violate the law, it is a penalty advocate."
Mr. Ditta is accused of being a criminal lawyer and too involved with particular customers.
The relationship we speak is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker that provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of its communications will certainly be of the importance of communications because it was his lawyer.
But this has gone well beyond the limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He entered the police's request as far as he could allow him to continue its activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor her profession, but deceived her.
He was too proud of some clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed to compromise his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I was not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the audience, the supervisor Lee Halstead of the Police of Lałaśire stated: "Mr. Ditta has passed from a criminal advocate to himself since he has started to gain drugs with organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has always compromised it and has made it vulnerable to the behind-mentioned members of the organizational groups who have loaded it of valuable information on police investigations.
Advocates should observe the most strict integrity rules and establish a confidence climate in the public.
Mr. Ditta has delivered this confidence and tried to open behind his profession.
The loaded unit of the serious and organized criminality of La Possibility led the request for Mr. Ditta, which was recognized for the tres cocain accusation officers and now acts in justice, witnessing his commitment to continue the chairs in justice.
Let this case serve a warning to the stakeholders so that they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself has been captured for 14 years after he has committed a fault of heroin, cocaine and cannabis complication.
Thirty-five other persons involved in traffic were condemned to a total of 153 years of prison for trafficking of stupefiants.
On his site, Ditta organized a meeting of questions/reply on himself during which he said that his dream job would be avocated to represent customers in the morning of death in America, his last invited to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would motivate him to work.

A new request for collective resources was submitted against the brothers of Sainte-Croix, regarding sexual agressions that would have been deployed this time to the Saint-Joseph oral, as well as in several orphelanates, agees and schools.

These recent publications are based on letters published by the avocate of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Me Emile Perrin in the 1990s, but also by the research made in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an ancient brother of Sainte-Croix, who denied them.
The collective resource must be passed by the stage of receiving in the High Court.
Once the Court accepts the receiptability, the second step, or the audiences on the basis of the Court, shall be conducted.

The Canadian Paliative Care Congress, which takes place this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after voting for the principle of the Medical Aid Project in Quebec.

The Kenyan pressure is subject to the contrary law on media
"It is a fearing country and it is urgent to ask: what will prevent Parliament from balance the independence of the Judicial system tomorrow?", said the journal, responding to the draft law and asking the unconstitutional statement.
"This law is draconic and very punishable, and we are doing it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of Capital Group – CapitalFM owner, one of the most independent stations and sites in Kenya.
He stated that the new Media Court “always will be partial because it is a prolongation of the Government” and that the restrictions relating to content and publicity would be distorted in the place of Kenya in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this draft law and to send it to the parliamentary," he said.
According to The Star, the new law project will allow the Government to have "the management of the media". The Standard indicates that the democracy and the freedom of opinion in Kenya had "a hard course" and smocked the "dracony" law project.
The adoption of the draft law is at the same time involved with a train of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the sillage of the attack perpetrate by armed islamists in the Westgate trade center in September.
The Kenyan media have survived the wrath of the authorities by spreading pictures of video monitoring cameras on which the groups on the scene of the attack were deployed by the trade center of luxe.

According to Daily Nation, “although one amendee is enough to paralyze most of the FM stations. ”
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the "animated blogosphere" of Kenya.
By reducing the media to silence, the political men know that they can do what they want in any way.
“ No one will be ever, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist in The Nation, describing the kenian media as a key source of control in life.
"The political men would put the country in deficiency and lead us to the cattle and cocktail."
The Kenyan Islators were the goal of the people's wrath in the past.
In May, they adopted position against the taxes ordered by the National Commission for salaries and repeated their mirobolic salaries of approximately 532 000 shillings per month – which are among the highest in the world.

The department of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) of Laval has caused an e-mail to address the Hotel of the city-de-la-Santé, and this, during the year 2012-2013.
As a result of multiple departments to retraite, maternity congestion or quite short departments, the pharmaceutical department was very deficiency in personnel.
Nearly 30% of the needed efficiency was missing, making this financial year "very difficult", ­ the Department's head, Gi`an Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to engage in an independent work, which may cost up to three times closer than a full-time farmer.
We haven't been able to deploy, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities have been analysed or decreased within the pair institution, the time that things are replaced.
We have certainly worked hard to interest our young people in pharmacy so that they come and stay here.
There was a concurrence of circumstances that caused us to be in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this hot period, 2013-2014, it is clearly easier to announce for the CSSS pharmaceutical department.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after their maternity and three other pharmacists have been embarrassed during the last months.
Moreover, the efforts made by the Department to hold fruits have been made, since the four currently residents in Laval also decided to remain at the employment of the CSSS.
Now, it's going much better, the pharmacist has highlighted.
From this end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three returns of maternity.
This will therefore comply with our departments of the past year.
Always growing
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as hospital pharmacists or young women' pre-domenance, make situations such as v ́s difficult to be predicted in 2012.
For us [the number of efficiencies] is always pregnant, because we have a young environment and we use many young women, so with gravities, we are almost always running at three maternity conges when it's fine, she's ggeated.
In the last year, we had much more and no farmers available to replace, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career at the film by the small door.
The Lars von Trier performer chose him to carry in Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next movie.
This Greek pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be out of two panels (the 1st and 8th January 2014), the erotic memories of a acro-sex-quarters from his adultery.
The similarity of Stacy Martin with her age is a brindille silhouette, a diaphane teeth and French origins.
Without forget of a certain go of the risk: the one who hadn't had to put it on the ice paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on the large ≤ran.
A Nymphomaniac extrait made the temperature up on the Toilet: Stacy Martin appears there in the bed and in full extase with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provoking cineast asked his sharers to put their poeder on the placard, he had been assigned to X professionals for the most obsessed sex scenes, before combining all bodies digitally: above the cinture, it is the star; below, the duplicate.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, holding by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of putting his actors in their last districts, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't finish talking about her.
A Evacuated CGR of Narbonne Thursday evening
Thursday evening, the first meeting of a movie was interrupted in the Mega CGR of Narbonne, with precaution, after picking up the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the establishment proceeded to evacuate the room and prevented the pumps for a suspicious dust.
Approximately 70 people came out of the meeting.
People have been examined and a complete employment of the room has not given anything.
Bad placeholder at the bottom of the lacrymogene jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Is it always that the movie direction has played the principle of care and security of its customers.
The room was locked and everything went back in order.
The film was able to recover his rights and customers find the pictures enjoying.
They'll just be on it.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into citro
Professor of the day of Halloween, a woman tried to enter the country two kilograms of cocaine dissimulated in citro, Thursday, in Montréal-Trudeau airport.
This is during the examination of the bathroom baggage that drugs could be detected.
The cocaine was distributed in three citros before empty.
The drug was then transported to the Office of the Royal Gendarmery of Canada (GRC) who took the rest in this investigation.
The Canada frontier services Agency (ASFC) did not reveal from where the woman came when it was intercepted.
This is part of the query, indicated Jacqueline Roby, ASFC portfolio.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, frontal services at the Montreal-Trudeau Airport have made 173 drugs, including 10 cocaine inputs for a total of 44 kg.
In 2012, the frontier services officers in Quebec region performed a total of 1653 drugs.
Air raid against military facilities in age
According to the Libanese Army, Israeli aircraft entered into the Lebanese airspace on Monday after midnight, but the flags had occurred in the evening.
A carriage of short air air carries SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tsahal's airport in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or by the Âe.
The raid was developed in nearly identical circumstances to the one who had occurred on 5 July: at the same time, it was also an anonymous American responsible who had confirmed the CNN a Israeli attack, which this time was viewed by the Yakhont solar mixtures, delivered by Russia to .
The Israeli responsibles did not hide their irritation to see Washington to reveal the attack, for the risk of prohibiting President Assad to respond.
Ukraine approaches la faillite
The Standard & Poor's notation agency has decreased the Ukrainian solvency note on Friday, providing doubts of the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, which has occurred for more than one year, to face its financial obligations.
The note of the country's debt titles passes to "B-" in the special investment category.
It is assorted of a negative perspective, S&P at least one chance on three to be renewed from here for a year.
"The Government's strategy is less than allows to ensure sufficient foreign debts to meet its high external financing needs," explains the American Agency.
The Agency points out that Ukrainian change reserves have fallen from 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and provides that the trend will continue.
This complies with the recovery of the credits taken to the foreign.
These reservations, which the authorities have massively recovered to support the local currency, the chryvnia, which is increasing, the Agency considers more evaluation, which would be worth its external debt.
Kiev, otherwise, needs liquidity to regulate its imports of gas to Russia, which causes not to have paid a factor of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of live pressure with its Russian neighbor, anxious of Kiev's will to sign an agreement with the EU end of November.
It was reported on the next day of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had passed between July and September its fifth quarter after contracting.
Its ended, yet relatively modesty, exploded in recent years, and S&P estimated 33.5% of the BDP, against less than 10% before the crisis in 2008-2009.
The country, in budget deficit, has been called for the international monetary Fund for months, which had granted him a credit of $15.3 billion in 2010, and has deblocked it for only $3.4 billion.
However, the Fund will pay any new tranche until the country has adopted immortal reforms to reduce its deficit, in particular by increased gas prices to the population.
Following a new infruiting mission in the country, the FMI found that "the important needs of external financing" constituted "a vulnerability", but in the context of "the signs of economic improvement".
However, for the Economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Centre of Political Study, "on cannot wait for a short-term improvement."
"The chairman's elections were planned in 2015, and the expert was asked to the AFP.
The only hope is a improvement of the international conjoiture.
S&P also refers to the "incertainty" related to the possible signature of an agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels provides for the liberation of opposing Joulia Timochenko.
"The signing of the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short-term negative consequences related to Russia's reaction," explained S&P, which fears "comercial restrictions" from Moscou.
Russia, representing the fourth of the Ukrainian exports, predicted that in the case of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its controls at the border for imported goods.
Green Fire of the United States to the Publicis-Omnicom Fusion
Publicis and Omnicom said Wednesday no objection from the American authorities to their combination, thus reflecting the creation of the first World Publicity Agency.
Fusion is actually approached by the Second World Agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group have announced today the expiration of the period of interview of the Fusion of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as sent," they announce the two groups in one.
They indicate that they also received the required authorisations in Canada, India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the period of examination laid down by HSR to the United States and the decisions of employment issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the implementation of the operation.
"The fusion is also conditioned to obtain other regulatory authorisations and to approve the shareholders of the two groups," they say.
The Congolian Army forcast the M23 rebels
The Congolian Army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units would go to the M23 rebellion to their bases in the forests and mountains of the North Kivu limitrope of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the point of being released from the North-East of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) that he was controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.
"We're going to follow the M23 and accumulate it where it is hidden because it's ggeles," Re·s said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, portfolio of FARDC.
We should not let them re-reserve because they have martyred the Congolian people for a long time.
The time came to bring peace back.
M23 responsibles explained to have evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political responsible for the rebellion, claimed that these military reverses would not have any refunds to peace speakers.
These recent, Uganda mediators, re-creed in Kampala between the Government of Kinshasa and M23.
Accrochases are reported in the provinces dominant Bunagana, the last location in the hands of the insects to be fallen this week, as well as in the neighborhoods, a mountain where M23 rebellion saw the day in 2012.
In their support in November, the investigators occupied Goma, leader of the province of North Kivu, who benefited from the flight of the Governing Garnison and the Blue Cascaes of Monusco.
Goma's fall brought the United Nations Mission in RDC, the most important to the world in the field of efficiency, to strengthen its mandate and to form a quick intervention brigade combined by South African, Malawi and Tanzan soldiers.
FARDC's major state has been refunded and the army has passed to the opponent against M23, making changes in the war course.
The progress rythme of the Governing Groups is now unexpected.
"The M23's touch at its end," a Congo business expert, Jason Stearns, suggests on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historical - that would be the first time the Kinshasa Government succeeded to make a major insurrection.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the RDC.
United Nations experts accused Rwanda, who had no disturbance, to support M23 militaryly, constituted by the former congolan military forces.
The leader of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show a detention, announced a portfolio of the Foreign Office.
The last week, Kigali had discovered the possibility of military reprises after obstacles fallen in the Rwandan territory.
Mercedy, the people of Bunagana invade the streets of the bourgade to salute the income of the FARDC soldiers.
"We have a year with the M23 and we seemed unimaginable to be released by the army," a people of this limited location in Uganda witnesses.
"We have v ́ in the fear (of M23), we're traumatised," said this man.
The tests practiced by the Institute Pasteur on a patient suspicious of being infected by the coronavirus were negatively revealed, announced the Ministry of Health.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only two cases confirmed in France today."
March, this 43-year-old patient was suspicious of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already made a 50-year-old dead.
Chevron, the second American petroleum company, has made a weekend of a decrease of its trimestrial benefit due to the decrease of its raffination margins, while its oil and gas production has increased in the remaining period in relation to the objectives of the group.
Its net benefit from the third trimester was reduced to $4,95 billion, or $2,57 per action, against $5,25 billion, or $2.69 per action, one year ago.
Analysts asked by Re·s were in the meantime on a benefit of $2,71.
The group produced 2,59 million oil equivalent bars per day during the trimester, increased by 2,52 million bpj produced one year ago.
The company includes 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% of the expected production from 2017.
The major part of growth in the future years will come from its projects of natural gas liquefied in Âe.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment costs increased by seven billion dollars in two years and should reach 36.7 billion dollars in 2013.
The benefits of production activities were significantly decreased to the third quarter, while the profits of the invasion activities (including refining and chemical production) falled from 45% to 380 million dollars.
This decrease of raffinage margins affects the sector's engine.
Thus, the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil has made on Thursday a low net benefit, despite the growth of its gas and oil production.
Educational transport: Received complaint
The School Commission of the Region-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year of $150 per ¤ (to maximum $300 per family) for two residents' benefits from school transport, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was recalled.
"The Commission proposed a mediation service and I was interested," explains Ms. Lefèvre.
It states that the CSRS was invited to be mediated and requested an additional time to consider it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to concert and to find solutions," Mrs. Lefèvre states.
The School Commission of the Region-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only signed that the mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Urgences of the Hotel-Dieu
In view of the random for several months by a part of the staff and several syndicates, including the CGT, the Minister for Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "delay the agenda for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closing emergency that could not be intervened on 4 November".
A officially requested "not to cover any risk of support of emergency in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also intended not to generate the PS campaign for a few months of municipalities.
Despite ministerial consignments, closure should be effective at that date.
Even if, in the APHP, it is preferred to use the term of "transformation" or "changing in continuity".
Since 4 November, the pumpers who provided about 40,000 annual passports to the emergences of the Hotel-Gou will have all received to take the thirty-severe cases daily to the urgency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the internationals.
In the Hotel-Dieu, the emergency-specific internal people will leave on Monday five internal doctors.
As regards the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the moon.
"The Hotel-Dieu emergency service must be closed in the shortest time, and for us, on 4 November," provides Loïc Capron, the President of the APHP Medical Committee, which supports the draft direction.
"The 4 November there will be no more patients brought by the pumpers, only those coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical responsibility of the new Hotel-Gou.
"But we will continue to accept patients in emergency," he warns the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles in place to transfer serious cases.
Ancient emergency doctors will remain on the place, if it also ensures.
But it is the ARS that it belongs to determine the closure of the acquiring service of emergency.
"The facts are progressive," answers Nicolas Péju, ARS portfolio for whom, on 4 November, "no changes will be made in terms of service."
"The Minister has lied to us or we have lied to him," declared the emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
From its head of the SMUR beginning of July, for taking the fault against the reorganization project, it is defined as a "alarm launcher" against a "chinical" decision taken by "the medical and administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxing emergencys that have been renewed less than five years ago," he believes.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services to absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly engrossed.
For example, there are some nine hours waiting for Lariboisière's urgency.
In the ARS, it is stated that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not able to represent a "balanche" in other emergency services, whereas human means will otherwise be strengthened.
In the ARS as in the APHP, the "new hospital model" is already held since 7 October and should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
From the end of the year, liberal generalists should also participate in the establishment of a "permanent ambulatory care".
"Where are we going if we ask people to self-diagnose," Gérald Kierzek asks who "the concept of no serious urgency" is "free" and marks a "medicin regression".
This will happen as for level 3 mothers.
People are not foolish, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the Minister doesn't take a measure from this Monday, we'll change brackets, Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be still more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider to present a list.
In the Team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP of Paris and chosen from the fourth arrondissement, he announced that "although the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergency at the Hotel-Diu, it would be technically and financially impossible to recover them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled her again Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken for a moratory so that it would not be closed on 4 November.
If that was the case, she would mark her net disappointment, he highlighted Bruno Ju日ard, her portfolio.
Although the Revolution of the Hotel-Gou has its priority on the ground, we cannot accept it without an acceptable report scheme to other hospitals.
Obama ends the hearings regarding the FMI and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to finish the hearings she practiced on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the framework of its information activities, indicating a American responsible, June.
This decision is part of the temptation of the White House to repeat the hand in the case of the NSA hearings after the revelations made by the former analyzant Edward Snowden, repeated in Russia.
This is the first time the monitoring of the FMI and the World Bank has been mentioned by the Information Agency since the beginning of the scandale.
A responsible for the US administration answered: "The United States do not conduct electronic monitoring with regard to World Bank and FMI to Washington."
In terms of anonymate, this responsibility did not indicate whether such supervision was carried out by the past.
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices during last weeks.
This instruction was given nearly at the same time as that ending the hearings of the UN's general quarter in New York.
In this context, the Secretary Commission of Information approved on Thursday the strengthening of controls on Government Monitoring Programmes but authorised their follow-up.
The Committee has established new restrictions on data authorised by information agencies to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the conservation of these information.
United Nations welcomes the new objectives for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new series of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (WTO), which have been set 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
The Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of "dual development objectives" to replace WTOs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summary on Sustainable Development, which started the guard to Rio de Janeiro.
They were in the previous final project of the document, which will be adopted by the world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon said to the survey that it was now time to "pass national interests".
"I am happy that Member States have accepted the launching and approving the process to set up universal sustainable development objectives (ODD)," he said.
These ODDs are supported by the progress achieved in the Millennium Development Goals and will be integrated in the development framework after 2015.
I will make the maximum to meet the mandate granted by the Member States to achieve our view of sustainable development objectives supported by WTO success.
Insurance related to security in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts arising between powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder president of Mozambique, tossing them, thousands of people gathered themselves in the centre of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare manifestation.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, general director of a investment society.
Anxiety for the future of her country, she changed its work clothes against a tee-shirt, which mentioned "We want security" in Portuguese before the people joined on the place of the Independence of the Capital of Thursday.
During two weeks, there were nearly every day reports that have been made between government forces and Renamo, the worst accrochage since the peace agreement signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was sometimes a glorious rebellious move, supported by the Rhodesia governed by white and then the South African Apartment Government in the context of efforts to destabilise the independent government of the country.
According to a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return in an open conflict, but recent events have distorted foreign investors and local population.
The enjoy is considerable for the full growth economy because the covering of large offshore gas reserves and carbon gains in the northwest could take over 50 Md$ of investment in the next years of companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil Vale, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the part of power and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo has mutually rejected the responsibility of pressures.
The Renamo states that the government is on the origin of recent conflicts and that he has launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of Renamo on 17 October.
The degeneration of ancient rebels was then degenerated when the government forces attacked the foundations of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the Portfolio of Renamo, the Financial Times.
The Government makes Renamo responsible for dealing with conflicts, and the accusation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza stated Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama was considered a "per" who wanted to use "all the forces he remained to try to prove that he could impose his decisions to the Government".
The Frelimo and Renamo are insisting to say that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern increased after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo abandoned the peace agreement of 1992.
He said to the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“ We want to repeat negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness, ” Mr. Mazanga said.
The discussions between the parties have not been able to gain food pressures through a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop dismissing themselves," explained Joseph Hanlon, a conference of the Mosambique Open and Specialist University.
None of them knows well to negotiate and no of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is for electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycotter the municipal elections before it had been done in November.
The presidential and islative elections are planned in the next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as the tentative of a diseased movement of conceitions and a war treasure from the government.
The part of the suspects has been collected by Renamo has stopped to fall since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Moviment of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by an elder member of the Renamo, should have a greater number of elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who should return to the end of his second mandate in the next year, would want to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multipartial democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has led light attacks on police and vehicles on a north-south-south axis.
Most of the accrochases occurred in the province of Sofala, which is over hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port where mines, including Rio Tinto and Vale, exports carbon.
In June, Rio couldn't use the iron road for about one week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was fairly timid when it was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not good to Mozambique, ” said Mr. Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations of the Government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, a independent media society, who also concerns corruption, lack of development and recent eliminations.
"The people think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is last to find problems solutions," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a manifestant, said that people wanted only stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Myths and mythes should be taught to children as “the models of life, ” says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "the brutal force does not make the weight of subtil russian," while the arthurians show the importance of having a dream.
By saying that many myths would be "too violent, very scandal, and in some cases, too obscenous to be taught at the oil," Crossley-Holland predicted a "minute selection" of works adapted to the age.
"I find amazing that in America, myths and peoplelors are already part of education," he said.
I've been welcomed for this project for 20 years.
He embraced that the authors and teachers are "openly teachers" make children "decrease completely", while messages are "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British People Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you will prefer to keep them out of view. ”
Perhaps the great difference between a adult writer for adults and a adult writer for children is the need for hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or finished well, but there is a sense of good and bad.
And it must be sublime; reveal through a story instead of stated.
The foundation of what we're shown and that we don't say.
A warrior of the Army of Hamas has been killed tonight and another wounded by a Israeli car stream in Gaza's band, have been learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a supervisory operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they carried out an obsession of a blind Israeli.
NSA spending: the United States 's gone too far', admits Kerry
The United States have sometimes gone too far as to spending, recognized the state secretary John Kerry, in this first April of Washington, on the massive data collection of data from the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and demissions between the United States and their European alliations, a US government responsibility is the first time that a government responsibility accepts explicitly the practices in the interception of the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I convince you that, as the President did, some of these actions have gone too far, and we will ensure that this will not happen more in the future," John Kerry said during a conference in London to which he participated since Washington on Thursday 31 October by video connection.
In his re-transmitted intervention, in the presence of his British authorised William Hague, the leader of the American diplomacy has long justified information practices and information collection through the needed anti-terrorist fight and the prevention of events.
On 11 September 2001, Madrid's attacks in March 2004 and London's attacks in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had enjoyed many expectations projects, using communications and information collection.
"We have actually prevented aircrafts to fall, to explore, and to explore people, because we were able to be on the top of these projects," the American diplomatic pattern argumented.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been disappointed."
But we strive to raise information.
"And, in some cases, it has gone too far away inappropriately," admitted the State Secretary, who had already had to express this international scandale during a turnover last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured that the President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and that he had a reexamen of these practices so that no one might feel a foolish."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to disrupt this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, NSA intercepted hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The journal, quoting documents received by the former consultant of the NSA Edward Snowden, states that the baptised program "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British Homologe of the NSA, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibres used by the Internet genders.
As one of the documents believed, about 181 million items were collected during the only month last of January - with metadanates on emails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would occur outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have deceived all the connections with these practices.
Since ten days, several large newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have shown that the NSA would have intercepted massively data and communications from the United States and their leaders, including the German Channel Angela Merkel.
In view of the wrath of European States and when refugees in the American press were stated that the American President was not in the context of such hearings, Barack Obama had to express it, calling on national security.
In contrast, the powerful NSA patron, general Keith Alexander, denied that his information agency had received tens of millions of European citizens' communications.
He even sent the ball to the European Information Services which would be entered from these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would refer to "military operations" in countries where the Otan Alliance co-operated with the United States and that would absolutely not show Europe, said General Alexander.
And the polymetic was on Friday in Asia.
Indonesia invited the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans in the framework of a wide international spending network, which also underscored China's ira.
The Saint-German Paris will receive Lorient Friday without his master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is wounded, announces the Ligue 1 club in a cheese.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco at the target difference, distributed the list of players held for this trip of the 12th day, without 32 years of age.
It simply indicates that it is "blassed", without specificing the nature of hurt.
However, he would suffer from the inflammation of the left gene when he returned the selection at the beginning of months.
A memory ceremonie of the crematised crimes
The cremeatorium of the Father of Lachaise organizes, at 11 hours, a laic ceremonie, in memory of all the dead in his establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate to Paris's maid, must be assisted there, and then will explain its proposals on the basis of a press conference.
To follow the ceremonie, click above.
For their own obsequences, in addition to French, they choose crème, rather than inhumanisation: 53%, a Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September by 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsequences of a nearby, it is the inverse: French prefer inhumanisation (53% against 47%).
If they have the harm to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose the creme.
In his book La Mort in cendres, Damien Le Guay, philosophe and → President of the National Ethic Committee of the Sepulture, insists on the "violence" which constitutes the crumation, for the surrounding.
There is, with the crumation, "a violence made by the loved body", which will be "reduced to a rate of cendres" in a very short time, not after a recovery process, which would "compact the phases of the deepness".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which involves "reduction of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymate" of the censes.
Why is it still bad in France that is accepted unfortunately in some northern and protestant countries?
"Because the crumation is a new fact," answers Marie-Frederic Bacque, President of the Danatology Society and author of the book Apprivoy death.
It is tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which limited the efforts to approve it.
Appreciation of the creaming is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director-General of the Secretary Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the dead a ceremonie as worth as to which he would be right with an inhumanisation.
Ipsos' annual request shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremonie.
77% of the French wish to be religious (53%) or civil (24%) for their neighbors.
Now,% of people who have chosen a crumation want to organize a ceremonie.
66% of those who do not believe also want it.
Crèmetors have been adapted to this society's development.
"Several years ago, they strive to avoid family violence of a waiting, without doing anything, for a hour and a half, immediately following the cistern release," notes Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions are now proposed by the teachers of ceremonies, which, in the presence of the body, go to the following ritual: accept the assembly, name the dead, link it to others, call it, give sense to his death, organize the dead.
This is the case of the Crematorium of the Father Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremonial masters often are people who have revered themselves.
There are also ancient Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the creetorium of the Father Lachaise has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, a number of ceremonies of memory, language and non-religious, to which he invites the family of those who have been credited in the year.
For the second consequent year, one of these ceremonies is submitted to the attention of those who would not be able to move.
The creematorium has allowed us to relax.
In La Seyne, the relocation for rats turns to the polymetic
At the beginning of the week, a family left his apartment in re-haused place of the Fructidor D2, due to the presence of rats .
Before the emergency of the situation, the director of the South Habitat Office proposed, in exceptional and provisional way, to repeat the couple and its three children in a new T4.
However, family is "for financial reasons" and the situation is locked.
The case has taken exhausted proportions, as Joël Canapa, director of the office.
Rates, there's always been in the towns.
The detraction undertaking performs two passports per year, and we, in addition, intervene at our charge at each request of the residents.
Thus, since the end of the last winter, we have made 64 interventions.
The quarter isn't left in the apartment, and the rats don't pull in the town.
For reasons for environmental protection and health, degradation products are four times less effective than the past but for two rats, a boy will not be killed.
"We haven't invited the rats to us," defends the family father who left his apartment to install in the hotel.
We're soon without the top and we're waiting for a new apartment, at the same tariff as the former.

A house of flames in the Old Quebec
A incendie that started midday Friday in the Old Quebec was quickly managed.
More than 30 pumpers were moved at the 9th street of Hebert.
The flames were declared in a house of three apartments divided on four stages behind the court of the Quebec Seminar.
All residents were absent at the incendie.
The fire was controlled one hour after the pumps' air, which were many to intervene.
Soon as our first pumps arrived, they really saw the appearing smoke.

An investigation is ongoing to find the cause of this incidence.
Ben Greenman : Tenth anniversary of New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the standup was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the Vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who took the role of the ceremonial master in the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to report blagues directly before the public, on the ton of the conversation.
The Innovation of Fay was perpetuated throughout the years, until the New York Comedy Festival was recently recovered.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up Club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 spectacles presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"The majority of the office heads have gone in Carolines, and have been a great success until they have become too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
The event of this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Start Up for Heroes", a comedious and musical night for the benefit of ancient fighters, organized in Madison Square Garden, which will be present, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took the width, just like the world of the come.
Many of the commodities participating at the festival of this year have passed through non-traditional circuits, for example presenting spectacles on small television chains, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a Sitcom on a capable chain ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football joyfully lascif from the FXX chain) and now has his own screen spectacle on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" emission and was part of the casting of the series " Parks and Recreation", but it is even more known for its series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians at the single voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic defensor of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralised world of the American commodity.
One of the main factors of the festival attraction this year will be a entrepreneur: David Steinberg talking with Larry David.
Steinberg started as stand-up commander, but it became a complete film and television performer, as well as an official story of the come.
Since 2005 and 2007, he encouraged a TV emission that was called “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg”.
The meeting is located at the Hotel of City, in the centre of Manhattan.
"The city is permanently in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he descended a roll between two immortals and said, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'd come to live here.
The price of the oil continues to fall and gets close to $96 the bar
The oil price continued to decrease Friday, while concerns relating to the importance of stocks are a report that shows that the Gurmukhian Chinese production sector is enhanced.
The American reference brute price for delivery in December was decreased from 14 cents to 96.24 dollars at the end of morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents Thursday, leaving it with a decrease of 5.8% for October.
The abundant brush oil offer has measured on the price during the last weeks.
The American Energy Department indicated that American supply increased by 4.1 million bars last week.
In five weeks, the supply increased more than 25 million bars.
However, two reports on the productive sector of China reached Friday, which show the growth of the activity, suggest a growth of the application.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to be reaffirmed after the growth increased to 7,8 % to the third quarter, after a decree that was not known for two decades in the trimester.
The brute Brent, a reference to the international brute already used by the American raffiners, lost 26 cents to fall at $108,58 on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in London.
In the case of the right to abort in Texas
A Federal Call Court repeated in Texas certain restrictions to the right to voluntary interruption of gravity which had been blocked by a judge of first instance this week.
This judgement means that a law text adopted in July in that State and broadly submitting the right to abortment will be able to enter into force.
The arrest made by the Call Court means that the doctors who will practice the IVG will have to have a "privilege of admission" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, according to his status of a hospital member, to accept a patient in a hospital or a medical centre in order to deliver a hospital or a treatment.
The IVA defenders claim that the contents of the law can be translated by a immediate closure of a third of the state clinics because these clinics did not succeed in this "privilege of admission" for their practices.
In total, it would be nearly 22.000 women who would be private for access to these institutions.
On Monday, a judge of first instance had considered the in force of the law that the provisions for the privilege of adoption were anticonstitutional.
But the General Attorney of Texas, the Greg Abbott Republic, who cares for the Governing Board, asked the Call Court for the first instancy that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary audience on this issue is intended for January.
The New Star has succeeded in force, at the side of audiences, with 1.3 million televisors behind their television post, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the spectacle at the meeting?
About 10 000 candidates were presented to the auditions of this 10th season, to address the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the reason for André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, televisors shared their comments.
As a result of the encouragement to find their favourite programme, many have been disappointed.
But why so much deception?
No candidate has actually been marked in this first premium.
Like each year, the first audience emissions make a wide choice of songs in herb, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Happy, some found their account there.
They are many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to have gone to the end.
After television screens, successful song calls are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to ridicule.
The Court blocks a decision on the control and foo policy of the NYPD
A Federal Call Court blocked on Thursday the decision of a judge requesting changes in the New York Police Department and declared the case.
The United States Call Court ( Second Circle) indicated that the decision of judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the call was issued by the city.
The Court had stated that the city had violated the Constitution after the implementation of its programme to control and interview citizens.
The city called out its conclusions and corrective orders, in particular a decision to assign a controller to help the police department to its policy and training programme associated with him.
The Call Court heard the arguments on the application of suspension on Thursday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the court should have been delayed in the case because it had violated the Code of Conduct of the Court by committing the need for a judge to avoid any aspect of partiality, partly because of a series of entrepreneurs granted to the media and statements in which it reacted to the critics of the Court.
The Court stated that the police officers violated the rights of decades of thousands of people by targeting the wrong of black and Spanish men in the framework of their programme of control and fo.
It appointed an external controller to monitor the changes, including the reform of policies, training and monitoring, and it ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in the quarters where the largest number of controls is located.
In aula, the city of New York accepted the end of the practice that consists of maintaining the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after police control.
The audience of the call interviewed by the city should have occurred after 14 March 2014.
Many civil rights defenders have criticized the tactic of control and fo.
This control and foo system exists since decades in a certain form, but the number of recorded controls has increased in a spectacular way under the administration of the independent master Michael Bloomberg, to reach his highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that were mainly concerned with black and spanish men.
A Judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and was transformed into collective action.
Participants who make changes in the NYPD control and fo · fo·thesis programme say that they will end unjust practices, will allow more effective police forces and confidentiality, and can change the way police departments use the policy.
The opposers say that these changes would reduce the police moral without deteriorating criminality, represent a decree of money, and would not solve the larger problem of police forces under pressure after the police effectives were highly reduced during the last decade.
The Court highlighted that it did not end the practices of control and fo, which were constitutional, but reformed the way NYPD implemented its controls.
Locators have to go to vote because each of them pays in average $100 per month on the price of the apartment that goes into taxes to the town.
When the owner pays $5000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each apartment.
We are obligated to pay the loans to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a message.
We need to change things in the town.
All candidates told us that they would attack the scandal debt.
We have no longer the way to pay 100 000 holidays, 4 to 5 million dollars in the case of...
Go to vote, this is the best way to express and say that it's enough.
End of service for the Cooking Chief of Elizabeth
In the 500 m2 of the elysed kitchens as made after working in ambassadors, the kitchen grew all the scales until it became leader, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou in Francois Holland, including Nicolas Sarkozy, including their vacation sites, and feed a number of big people of this world in a nearly anonymate that he breaks only today at the time of the retraite at 60 years.
The man on the open, crown degarni and lunches of intellectuals, born on October 24, 1953 in the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is a holder of a CAP.
His mother was her own kitchen in a Sologne castle.
"I have passed from a chastisement the other!", Ironis Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six presidents for whom he has officed, but also of their wives and some of their invitated illustrations.
"This is always the head of the State or his companion or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly in the kitchen," while she had prohibited women in the cookies of Elisea!
Don't move to State leaders who showed a relative indifference to the earthquake, " they are all gourmands," he gently states Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had certain "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the sandwich, the assets returned empty!
As regards François Holland, who repayed the fraction, "it's someone who loves eating" and "It's not a great thing that he doesn't love."
The current leader of the State, who has recovered the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has no "specific application".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that was weakened on his emblems, especially during the dinners of the State in Elisea: it must be used " between 200 and 250 people in an hour."
The last night is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were errors.
Now the old chief of the cookies of Elisea, who took a swimming glass on Thursday night with his team, his family and friends, parting with a painting in the heart."François Holland came to salute me."
He's saying awkwards.
"He's a human side," he said.
The leader will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, which is for its part since seventeen years in Elisea.
Food in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historical house built in 1850 was the proie of flames in the Old Quebec Friday Sunday.
The inclusion of four apartments, held at the 15th street of Hebert, made three alarms at the incendie service.
The fire was declared before, but he rose up on the three stages of the inflammation.
France Voiselle, a portfolio of the Protection Service against Quebec Incendies, stated that the rapid intervention of pumpers has allowed the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a challenge of size for this sector of the city where the immovable is built in a repeated manner.
The fired house opened four apartments, but no resident was located on the places at the time of the incendie.
The damage has been limited to all, even if the water has caused disasters.
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin, but the sapers have separated the tese of an act of ≥1 %.

Coulson used the phone piratage to check a shot
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "the phone piratage, monitoring and confrontation" to try to confirm a bidon tuyau on a link involved by the Ministry of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
The Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the Court of Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a fake voice in May 2005, which Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pa日by, his “beauty special adviser”.
It was reported to the court that the journal was charged by Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to pirate the vocabulary box of Pa日by and to "plant permanently before his door", but Coulson also called it and left him voice messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of notW, is not the type of man to stay before the people's house, hopeing to surprise them, is the type of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," Mr. Edis said.
He stated that notW used three ways to question the subjects: telephone pirateage, monitoring and confrontation.
The head editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that it is at the corner of the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
But what's the first thing?
Did he know the phone piratage?
He states the contrary, but we say “Of course. ”
The sounds on a link involved by Clarke were first renamed by the notW editor office when a source, triing a sexual attraction to Mrs. Pajdeby, said that it was said to her: "Do not lose your time with her, she is with Charles."
A band, recorded at least three times on his phone, was introduced to Mulcaire's house in 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of the private detective who concerned Mrs. Pajdeby and his sister in a document "Projects".
During the period where the detective asked about it, the grandparents of Mrs Pajdeby received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about it, Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the elder reporter, head of Neville Thurlbeck and the old reporter James Weatherup, monitored the monitoring of the smaller facts and gestures of Mrs. Pajdeby.
In a vocal message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we are going to make tomorrow I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that the involvement of Coulson in the history followed the same scheme as with other important men, such as the former Ministry of Interior David blutt.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blu日tt about a relationship with a married woman while he himself often had the Rebekah Brooks co-defense, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks did not have conspired with others to pirate phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 to 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted that they have made the phone piratage.
Barack Obama receives the Iraq Prime Minister, full of violence flame
The American President had to receive the Iraqic Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday 1 November 2013, seeking the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
In October, Iraq knew its most dead month in five and half years, the numbers held on Friday, 1 November, by the Iraq authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1 600 were hurt.
The United Nations gives an even higher balance of 979 dead and 1 902 wounds.
These violences are more murdered, despite strengthened security measures and military operations to overcome the government of Nouri Al Maliki, which is dominated by the chitis.
The total number of deaths in October has been the highest since April 2008, when 1 073 people were killed.
Nearly two years after returning to the American troops, the level of violence makes fear of a new embrace, while neighborhood is proud of a civil war.
Bombs broke markets, muscles, marriages and funerals.
Mans are cast into a full street or even with them, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The increasingly increased solar minority, to the power of Saddam Hussein, which claims to be marginalised politically and to be the objective of unjust arrests, has contributed to this flamb of violence.
Thursday, new violence killed four people in north of Iraq, on the next day of the death of at least 26 people in a series of expectations, including the explosion of five cars to the north of Bagdad.
Many of the violences have been involved in the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group associated with Al-Qaida (Sunish Extremistes), also involved in the civil war in EEC.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a World War against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the center of entrepreneurs in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, which will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their meeting on 12 December 2011.
At that time, the American President, chosen on the promise to end military commitment in this country, had made a optimistic table of the situation.
Since Wednesday arrival to Washington, Nouri Al Maliki multiplied the meetings with the exemplary, and the elections of the Congress.
Thursday, he planned the international community to lead a "third World War" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of an increased security aid in Iraq is supported by Republican and Democratic Senators.
But those recents also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a chit, which attributes to him the partial responsibility for the recovery of violence by its "sectoral and authoritary policy".
They also requested Barack Obama to understand in Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraq government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Pekin accuses an eyegroup of the Tiananmen attack
The Chinean Inner Safety Chef accused Friday a group of Xinjiang-separators to be behind the waiting for the pig-up car that made five dead in the city of Tiananmen in the center of Pekin, Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, founded on the multitude on the famous place of the Chinese capital, symbol of the murder repression in 1989, and fired by killing his three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, member of the Political Bureau for Internal Security, accused the islamic movement of East Turkestan to be the instigator of this attack.
Many augures, a turcophone minority installed in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province the East Turkey.
For the Chinese Government, this movement is responsible for frequent violence eradications that are being animated by independent recruitments.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Pekin has been organized and predecessor," Meng said to the Hungarian-Congaish Phoenix TV chain.
"The group held in coulisses was the islamic movement of the East Turkish," he said, "and its proposals were repeated by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that it is originating in Uighoure and indicated that his wife and his mother were with him in the car.
This was also containing recipients filled with essence and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The accident made 42 wounds.
The islamic movement of East Turkish is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a large survey throughout the world on how paroises manage the sensitive documents such as contraception, divorce and couples of people of the same sex.
The survey asks the participants how the priests take care of the gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live in life without being joined by marriage links.
The investigation was sent to mid October at each national conference of eveques, with the most possible answers.
The information will serve a major race on the family that Pope François intends to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic Journal of the United States.
A portfolio of the Conference of the United States Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each episode would decide the appropriate way of the Parisians.
In the United Kingdom, evics conducted the Internet investigation by requesting Catholics to participate.
RDC: Army attacks the last five of the rebels
M23's irreductives, or about hundreds of fighters, were decreased by about 2000 meters of height on the agricultural areas of Chanzu,ijuonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Joba, two locations of about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"This hasn't stopped since this morning, fighting continues despite the night," said a Jomba inhabitant, joined by phone at 12:30, and who a girl was hurt by ball in the morning.
"The intensity of the conflicts has decreased a little," he said, "is that the RDC Armed FARDC forces have rejected the rebellion."
According to this witness who wants to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" to Joba before they went up to front for a "racing operation".
We heard very quite behind him of food weapons of weapons.
From Bunagana, political fifth and last strong place of rebellion fell on Thursday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of weakened weapons.
According to a source of the United Nations Mission for the Stabilisation of the RDC, the fights were "in a final phase", the FARDCs "included the positions of M23 remaining to deploy them".
Since June 23 March (M23) and Army, Monusco does not participate directly in the fights, but it provides to government groups a determining support for information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several tens of soldiers, well provided in municipalities, came to the front line.
They were armed by kalachniks and lance-rockets.
A little lately, on the road leading to Bunagana, the border post with Uganda, civilian military soldiers loaded a multi-rocket lance on a nine flaming truck of the FARDC, before ensuring the rise of another engine piloting M23 positions on the fabriks.
The Congo president, Joseph Kabila, called on Thursday evening once again the rebellion to "demove voluntaryly" in order to be disarmad by the force, but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 discussed since December without result for the instinct.
Instead, M23's political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the speakers, there is no more than the Uganda mediation to organize the sign," said Roger Lumbala, President of the M23 delegation, without that this information could be confirmed immediately from the Government side.
M23 was born by a mutinery in April 2012 of ancient rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated in the military in 2009 after a peace agreement.
United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda to support M23, which replaces Kigali and Kampala.
The North Kivu is one of the most deeply small regions of the RDC, and its subsoil is aware of convoid mine resources.
In Bunagana, the Uganda border side, where approximately 5000 people were repeated between Monday and Thursday, the return to the RDC that started at the morning returned to the midday.
"This morning we went to go to our fields, but the soldiers told us to answer us," told the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, around his nine children, including a food on the back.
We have the impression that fire-cooks approach people.
At the beginning of the evening, tens of residents crossed the border, some with a math on the head, to pass the night to Uganda.
The musical comedy, this scene beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in French or French, the songs and danced production take their envelope.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds his voice.
This is a revolution: the French musical is a successful type.
Longtimes, from Our Dame of Paris to Mozart the opera rock, most of the trials would be in the ridicule.
And successes such as Cabaret or the Misérables were brought the mystery areale.
The archae of Jean-L日 Choplin at Chatlelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes mention the titles as successful tubes.
The first reprehend, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announced for the next world creation of "A American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Bell and the Beast" could be one of the successs of the season.
On the other scenes, music spectacles such as "1789", "Bastille's lovers" and small musical comics such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are placed in the range of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the Reference Book "History of Music Commissary" and conference at Theâtre du Chatelet, analyze the reasons for so hardly conquised success.
How do French musical commissions develop?
The offer was demultiplicated.
The "music spectacles" are being developed by producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a real story as in 1789, the Bastille Amants.
Others make a bunch of fifty years back under pretext that we can use nearly anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of office.
Then we have musical comedies with the suspicious productions of the Castelet that make us live the Gold Age of Broadway and discover the Universe of Stephen Sondheim, the biggest lifetime.
The entertainment stage popularizes anglo-saxon musical comedies by adapting them to French.
Independent French producers are trying to perceive.
But current projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of the Arabic woman" or "The Awake of Primemps" are difficult to be financed.
Do we have enough artists like a song, playing and dancing Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical spectacles in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects in projects.
In the United States, this is very different.
Young people are trained in many schools.
The jobs are many among the regional, tourned teatres, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The lives of talents are thus as the number of posts to deal with.
Why have the tours in the province so successful?
Except the oper, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
Small teater parts are turning around and it is often the theatre of bulevard for adults and not for young adults.
The musical spectacles combine this lack.
These are the same youths who love telereality and what it produces as ephemer stars...
To propose beautiful young men (so talentful) in the head of a musical spectacle, it is the assurance of the engaging of these young girls and often of their entire family.
Facebook pages of these spectacles are probably held by professionals who respond to questions.
These spectacles are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The maionnaise is mounted in Paris and disgusted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter into all the large France rooms in the same form as in Paris.
A serious hurt in an accident with a fantom driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident made a serious wound, Friday at 5:30, on the inner ring of Brussels at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
The car of a driver has been gained by a fantastic driver, which is indemne to him.
The ring was closed at the holding, until 9:00 a.m., in the place of the a.m., as long as the road is deployed and that a expert determines the circumstances of a.a.
However, this situation has not been well caused by embouteillages because it has occurred at the height of the Hoeilaart output.

RDC: Army prepares a new meeting
Children play on a carboned blind that belonged to M23 rebels in Kibuba on 31 October 2013 in East of the RDC.
The Congolian Army was prepared on Friday for a new trial against the last bases of M23 rebels near the Bunagana, East of the RDC.
The goal is to deploy the M23 of the fabriks that overflowing the Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina's hill, which surpluses Mbuzi's.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from herself.
It will remain only the colline of ́yonyi.
"Cell de Chanzu is not very strategy," AFP stated the Governor of the North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku's planning to return to Bunagana Saturday.
Political and strong place of rebellion, this location is located at the Uganda border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was recovered Thursday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Since some hundred inreductives of M23, nearly 2,000 meters of height on the agriculture areas of Chanzu, habenyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the neighborhood of Joba
In Joba, a people who had been fighting every nearby Thursday all day indicated that the situation was "cool since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fights of the guard and were buried.
A girl was wounded by ball, and three other people were hurt, including a greedy, evacuated by the FARDCs, has made this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the return of the fights between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belgerers did not give any balance of losses in life.
NSA revelations increase the paranoia of enterprises in relation to State Monitoring
By a beautiful day of end, a German police helicopter survived lowly the British French Consulat, the German financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German Information Agency, his mission was to photograph the American Pre-Post Top, which was at least 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German Media explains that BfV would hope to identify the presence of audience antennes and that the operation had made a exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Affairs Minister in Berlin.
James Öpper, the Director of American Information Services, again insisted on the fact that the United States did not use their abilities for foreign information to "flow the industrial secrets of foreign enterprises for the account of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their benefits".
However, since Edward Snowden, the adviser, became a denominator, began to develop his inevitable treasure of information on the secrets of the United States Monitoring, European governments and business leaders do not know anymore whether the Director should believe in word.
Reports, which the United States National Security Agency spyed the Brazilian Petrovas petrol company and had access to data contained by American storage services providers in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever understood the paranoia of companies in respect of State Monitoring.
The revelation which the German Channel phone Angela Merkel had been pirateed, perhaps even for a decade, was the water bullet that made the vessel overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be mentioned, then business leaders are probably also possible targets.
Snowden has made the intensive training between American information services and enterprises.
I think it is designed that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"The German must wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing the German SMEs in the TI sector.
The German companies believe that the United States represents a risk as important as China when it is a industrial and data-flow spending, an investigation held in July by the EY Council Cabinet.
Nevertheless, in all documents devoted by Mr Snowden, there is nothing in this day that the United States had transmitted foreign business secrets to American companies.
Political men were concerned about the idea that the EU does not have sufficient information and Internet capacity and think that it should strive to reduce its dependence towards the United States.
Business leaders are sceptical about this matter.
A Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close the eyes and open them quietly...
"This is not the right way of doing," states Hasso Plattner, President of the German Company Software Society, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European TI industry, it wasn't necessary to let it go 20 years ago.
Everything is subvented in Germany, carbon to cars, by agricultors.
All other than the TI industry.
However, the width and sophistication of American spinner agencies exposed to Snowden's revelations were a shock for certain companies that thought that China represented the largest risk in terms of supervision.
A major change is being made in the cloud information, since European responsibles have noticed that the data contained in the United States are regulated in accordance with the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional agency, about 10% of the non-American members have rejected their projects to use a American storage service provider in the cloud after the reports on the US Data Exploration Programme.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-director, says: “Our customers today ask us a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you ensure that they will remain in this court?”.
Many German leaders indicate that the recent reports are only a confirmation of what they already know, meaning that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at any price.
It is not surprising that there is an economic spiral.
There's always been.
"It's a subject that has been repeated for many years and has not changed anything in the present debate," says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the BASF Chemical Products Society.
The Americans are spending us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy them, because it is in national interest to defend our business.
Business leaders are usually few inclined to reveal the preventive measures they have made, where this would allow the benefit of an opposite.
The large companies have a long time marched the message, which is for at least imprudent to recover a free USB key in a professional room or to leave a mobile operator without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the Audi Car Construction Board, says that the collection of telephones before the Council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote auditors, is a coherent practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider the use of simple mobile phones prepaid in their travels to the foreign because of the risk of attachment to the integrity of smartphones.
The pre-paid phones are then cast.
However, we are afraid that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to pirating and monitoring.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their special nine.
"SMEs are often missing experience, staff and financial resources to protect their industrial secrets against unapproval access," BfV warns in a report.
The United States warns their own companies on economic spending activities carried out by other countries.
The National Stimate Intelligence (NI) made in February by the United States, quoted France, as well as Russia and Israel, due to the second degree of making economic information pirateing acts behind China, The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Administration of a renamed German company estimated that in the case of economic spending, “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, an elder of French internal information, the DCRI, said in this month, "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spending their aliens."
Parents of a teenager in Georgia, who is dead in insolite circumstances, believe that their son has been embraced
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a battle paper rolled in his school gymnase, thinking that their son was appealed, said the lawyer of the family Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, in Georgia, was found on January 11 in a stuck-speaking bag behind his school gymnasis.
The investigators of the Sheriff of the Court of Lowndes concluded that Johnson was dead in insolite circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old young boy contested these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son has been disabled," said Benjamin ́mp, the representative of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as it is indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff.
“ They think that it has any logic, laws and common sense, ” he said.
They are convinced that these conclusions were granted in the only purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their sons to the oil with a cart, and they brought it to them in a dead sack," he said.
The prosecutor of the United States Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation on Johnson's death, highlighting that several important issues remained without answer.
What's the cause of death?
Is it the result of an act of death?
Moore expressed himself at a press conference Thursday after midnight.
I'll give the facts where they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis" to open an official question, he said.
Moore stated to journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was dead by “positive asphyxie”.
However, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, Moore.
"Several questions still deserve a response or confirmation," he stated.
Moore said that if he updated the elements of nature to justify a civil or penal investigation on Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to lead it.
The representative of the Sheriff of the County of Lowndes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgian court ordered the authorities to submit all the video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
Young parents said that they hoped that video images contain indications on the circumstances of his death.
CDC's advice on allergies in the child's school destination
Wednesday, the United States Control and Prevention Centre has made a series of directives indicating how to manage children's food allergies at the oil.
It is the first series of direct lines that the American Government is, since the number of children of age suffering from food alergies has intensely gripped.
A child of 20 in the United States today suffers from food allergy.
The CDC discovered that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information intended for schools on how to train the teacher and staff to food allergies in the child and how to treat them in case of allergic reaction.
He also recommends schools to have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen mark auto-injector, which is the most couragingly used – to be able to respond rapidly in case of potentially deathal anaphylaxie.
The Islative Assembly of States have recently updated the regulation to allow schools to have easier epinephrin in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms of children who have allergic reactions.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something makes me a tongue," "I have the impression of having a hair on the language" or "I have piotements on the language."
The NSA case highlights the total debates on information
How can you explain the contradictional attitude of the French Government, who, from one part, is publicly engaged by calling the United States ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand, prohibit the surplus of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the voice of presence at Edward Snowden's border?
I think there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Holland phones at Barack Obama or when the Laurent Fabius foreign business officer calls the United States ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the width of the American supervisory overseer in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the World Columns for a few weeks of interval of the playing of the American diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condamnation of the hearings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be like a vague hypocrisy from you?
The journalist approach is not a moral position, but the research of interest and information belonging to each citizen that allows a view.
When WikiLeaks lifts up the wall on the analysis by the American political or other injuries throughout the world, we consider that this is a significant lighting in view of the American power.
When we describe the American interception systems against the French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any way to disturb us of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations with regard to our interests?
Can we be deprived of the American Propertyation?
The introduction of very powerful interception tools by the United States, but also by France, was officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Furthermore, in this area, France and the United States have introduced procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described by part and other as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribe areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
For example, France can be conducted to transmit all data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, in contrast, it has already been said quickly - the Americans can provide information to the French about other regions of the world.
The question of the fund behind this case is not the ability or the right of the countries to entertain, as well as the issue of the total absent of preliminary debate, in particular in the Parliament, on the justification of such systems, the period which must be theirs, and, at the end, the issue of the achievements of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States? a degradation of their image?
I don't know how they can be punished.
The risk of the Americans may be double.
The first, it is when their alliations - and it was recently - they realize that their leaders, sometimes at the highest top of their State, were monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States were drawn up.
Another effect may be more economically: more than European or South American companies are intended to provide their confidential data to American providers under the American laws and therefore to the NSA.
Last element: the large movement of revelations involved by the media of the world, which contributes to the launch of a debate on the monitoring practices of information services until now almost inexistent, could move the islators, including Americans, to review the powers they have given to their information services.
Parents of intersected children may choose "indetermined sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for food born with ambiguous sex bodies.
The male or female sex of the newly born will no longer be attributed to them to birth.
In the context of the new law, parents will no longer be able to declare their child's sex, allowing them to enter a "indetermined" sex or "not split" on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the Law was to remove the pressure that was weakened on the staff of the parents that could take priority decisions on sexual resignation chirurgicals for their food, and to fight discrimination against intersected persons.
According to the BBC, a intersected person would have said years later, “I am not a man or a woman. ”
I'll stay the patch'k that the doctors have created, contusioned and balafred.
We believe that a child of two thousand born every year is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersected, intersexuality, which is part of the group of sixty-fire diseases as sexual development disasters, a generic term designed by persons possessed by chromosomes or goes (even or testicules) or abnormally developed sexual bodies.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersected.
The sexual identification is still not well comprehensive, but most of the United States specialists say that when sex is not able to be determined, it is better to use the best information available to allocate it, then wait and follow the psychological development and the child before considering a chirurgical act, where appropriate.
Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiatrist in New York and specialist of sexual identification issues, said that the new German law “be a good idea”.
Intersected children have a ethical dilemma.
“ Some people suffer extremely serious diseases that need a chirurgical action, but that is not the case of most children, ” he said.
It is possible to make sexual assignment without operation, and to see how identity develops.
The science that consists of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question to know why this happens.
It's like mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the persons intersected as different from transsexual or transgenous persons, since their status is not linked to sex but instead to their biological constitution, which is not either the man or the woman's, but is generally both at the same time and not fully defined as one or another.
These characteristics can be shown by themselves in secondary sexual characters (e.g. muscle mass, pilosity, poitrine and status), primary sexual characters (e.g. reproductors and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also highlighted the discrimination against intersectioned and transgenous persons in the field of employment, as well as the width of the acts of harm and violence and crimes motivated by prejudices.
Young boys of non-conformity now have camps that are specially designed to them.
Australia and Nepal have already authorized adults to record male, female, or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to have been recognised "neutral" after having won his calling process that has to keep a "non-specified" sex.
German passports will conduct a third assignment by M or F – X for intersection, the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always subject to conflicts, a report on France 24.
In 2011, twenty-one issuers in this Catholic country signed a petition for the “theory of the genres ” to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed the German law, writeing that “as the world is treated into a new government where the type is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, there are two other piliers of civilization. ”
In Maryland, the mother of a feedback also stated about Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be assigned to children at their birth.
"The role of your parents is sufficiently stressing without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and security.
Historyly, children who were born without male or female bodies were called Hermaphrodites, according to the name of the great Greek god who had a double sex.
And no longer a decree of years ago, the medical community viewed the type as an ardoise, that it could be done and on which it could be restored.
But now, many are those who reject the ethical foundation of chirurgie, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that doctors may sometimes find out, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignation when he grows.
“ In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric urgence, ” said Drescher.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiater, we were phoned to the chirurgian.
The dominant theory on how to treat children by ambiguous sexual organs was the subject of Dr. John Money, of the University of Johns-Hopkins, who believed that the type was unleavenable.
He dedicated the term “sexual identity” and supported that social and environmental signals – the way parents have a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to form it in order to be identified as a man or female sex.
But in a case of 1966, known under the name John/Joan, his theories had occurred to controverses.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut down during a broken circumcision to make him caught completely, to remove the testicules, and to lift it up as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful case of transition, but it wasn't the case," Drescher said.
At approximately 15 years of age, he returned a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years, he suicided.
Drescher said that some doctors “repeat always this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the Internet array, those who have survived these sexual change operations say: “They are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer of Montana, who is born with XY basic chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors couldn't really say if he had a wide clitoris or a little penis and were convinced that he could never have a "friendly life" as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce was a chirurgical abolition of the external body and witnesses and was raised as a girl.
He's taken female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years, he went up a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realized that something wasn't worth, he asked his medical dossier.
What he discovered was terrified.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disaster of sexual development (DDS) which prevented its body to produce enough testosteron so that its sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, he returned a man, following the treatment of the testosteron, and removed the tissues.
The chirurgy made it sterile.
Today, it defends the cause of others in a organization called Interface Project, who is trying to normalize the perception of intersected people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director-General of the non-governmental organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law “invites to labelling and stigmatizing”.
"To many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make rapid decisions and give their children a "indetermined sex", she said.
We are afraid that it encourages interventions.
We think it'd be better worth allocating a man or female sex, and waiting.
But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only advance hypothesis.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported the Australian law because “ she allows adults to choose to be recognised under the third sex calling”.
“ Adults should be able to take their own decisions on a genre, ” she said.
The German law refers to sexual allocation to birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiolog specialised in the mammographies in Pittsburgh, whose girl has reached a disaster of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will "is" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, is born with basic chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called a complete syndrome of inefficiency to the androgene.
Because of the deficiency of its anthrogenic recipients, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagin, but not outer or eggs.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and internally in psychiatries in Pennsylvania's university.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through the service of adoptions or mothers.
"The law leaves a certain wideness to parents so that they do not have hazard decisions," Baratz said.
This allows them to make some tests and understand them, and a time before entering "man" or "feminin".
So everything's fine – you can highlight your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being parents.
You don't have to predict for a chirurgical intervention that is irreversible.
"This makes children in the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they fear not to do what is necessary," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/ she feels the more at the axe – and it's something amazing.
This allows the child to take the decision for himself.
Letta trusted in the long-term of its government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that its Government will maintain up to 2015 despite the strong pressures between left and right within the coalition to the power to approach the Senate vote to depart Silvio Berlusconi from its mandate.
In an interview at the Daily La Stampa, the Left Centre leader said to have " shut up the intention" to continue to rule with its coalition until the next islative elections of 2015.
The high room of the Italian parliament will meet in the moon to decide whether the former President of the Council sentenced for tax fraud in aù.
Silvio Berlusconi threats to return its support to the Government if the Senat, where he counts more opponents than the parties, states its destitution.
However, a part of his camp, rubbered around the National Secretary of the People of Liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as showed it on 2 October, to cease to Berlusconi's injunctions, who had already wanted to destroy the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an American Transport Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspicion, has been hurt during the fire exchange.
Pumpiers called on drama sites claimed that they had responded to a call of "multifold hurt".
"The order forces are on place," says the airport on Twitter account, while TV images would show people evacuated in ambulances.
" There was a fusillad," AFP said a portfolio of the American Transport Safety Agency (TSA).
The local antenna of ABC would show an evacuated person on a card, and a second transported on a roulant error.
The incident occurred at 9:30 local (12:30 in Montreal) at the 3st terminal of the airport, also indicated the airport.
The Los Angeles Times indicates that the 2 and 3 thresholds are on evacuation.
The TSA portfolio was not able to confirm immediately if one of its employees was hurt.
All flights in the airport and the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a member of Hamas in Gaza-sces
Israeli car rents killed a Palestinian islamist military in Hamas on Thursday and greetly hurt another in the south of the Gaza band, learned after sources of health services.
A source of Hamas explained that fights have been exploded in this region, because Israeli cars have expelled the border and have been designed by your turns of Palestinian murderers.
The Israeli army was pleased to refer to a "destined action" in the nearby area of a qualified tunnel of " terrorist" by the Hebrew state, covered to the border and whose covering was in the middle of October.
Report: The Obama campaign considered to fall Biden for Hillary Clinton
The nearest advisers of President Barack Obama considered, in the largest secret, to replace President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the list of 2012, New York Times.
This revelation is the most marvelous event found in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the book to appear and told Thursday evening that the chairman's neighbors had conducted "profonded travels in groups and investigations end 2011" to see whether Biden's eviction could help Obama to re-election while his hopes were mentioned.
According to Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the higher responsibility of the campaign and the Maison-Blanche, namely the former Secretary-General of the Maison-Blanche Bill Daley, aiming to measure the effect of the replacement of the President by the former Clinton State Secretary.
The possibility of exchange is a secret that has been fully kept within the Chicago QG campaign and within the oval Office.
Only a half-twelve neighbors of the President – including Daley, the former leader of the campaign of Obama Jim Messina and the elderly advisers in the Maison-Blanche David Axelrod and David Plouffe – the change was in the study.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley had the charge to replace Biden, despite their “heavy personal links” before finally decided against the change when the numbers showed that Clinton had on the presidential list “the chances of success of Obama would not just improve.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually intended to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I said I had examined a series of questions, and it was one of them," Daley said in the journal.
Remember that at that moment, the President was not in form, and so we said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the "concert", Martin indicated to Anderson Cooper of CNN that the reelection campaign had much invested to discover whether the change would be beneficial during the scrutin.
"The campaigns do not include much money to the investigations and discussion groups unless they are seriously intended to take measures," Martin said on ­360.
However, we don't know whether Obama was able to examine the replacement of his team.
Martin told the CNN that he had asked Daley if his patron was at the end of the possible recovery.
Although Daley said that he didn't think that the President was "forward" of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin said that "Double Down" did not finally answer the question of whether the political investigations were reached on the Obama office.
Cooper asked Martin if he felt seriously that Obama didn't know that Biden's exhibition from the President's list was examined.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
You want a fluo ice?
A British undertaking created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on medus.
Charlie Francis took part of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop an exhibition.
He had the idea after reading a medical study and convinced Chinese scientists to regenerate chemically the protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language by increased protein pH to make it.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to mourning when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, more we laugh, more it becomes tragic.
Charlie, the founder of the ice society "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said, "It's something incredible but we're still on the beginning of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200 £."
The protein we use in ice reacts with neutro pH language.
So when your mouth breaks the protein, the pH level increases and the ice goes to.
We tested it during the last months, and it seemed appropriate to share it with all at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary effect.
It's probably the sweetest ice that I created because the scarce of the medicines is worth four times lover than gold.
So every bottle costs me about 140 pounds.
But she's pretty good go!
The company at the experimental approach of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its ice parfs such as bird, wheat, bow and gold fe.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He said: “I really want to develop an ice in·. ”
This is intrinsicly impossible because of the refraction caused by ice cristals that constitute the ice creme, but I think I will find a way to reach it.
The ice uses fluorescent properties of the mixture synthetised by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed was dead during a tai chi session
The song Lou Reed died while he was doing tai chi exercises, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter held by the regional journal "East Hampton Star" and destinated to the people of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist was dead last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, while he looked at the trees and performed the 21th motion of tai chi, with his hands of musicians who found air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The song's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to make her out of the hospital and to take her to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are citizens, it's our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beautifulness of the world will send to many people the wonderful joy of living that he had," she said.
Lou Reed had recently reached a grip of the fee in May.
Halloween 2013 : In digits
When I was young, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat bonbons, to go to bed later and to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more nice.
In the last two years, I have not distributed one bonbon and I will certainly not do it anymore this year.
But the states show that I'm the galous sheep when we're talking about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, which costs a total of 6,9 Md$ in bonbons, degushments and decorations, the National Retail Federation.
What I'm doing with impatience to every Halloween festival, it's the trends.
The exemptions should represent $1,2 Md of $ 6,9 billion, NRF.
This year, sexy inanimated objects make angry.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they may also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carots.
For men, I have to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I believe the men of Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most searched deguts are zombies, Batman, pirates and stars.
I guess there's no bad to stay traditional.
We cut our dogs last year and, in my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, the Americans will cost $330 for animals this year, NRF.
It makes a lot of interesting dogs in hotdogs.
When it's about bonds, we don't glondo.
The Americans will cost $1,9 in bonbons this year, the Nielsen cabinet.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who go to the bathroom in their neighborhood, the American Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, not tell us stories, consume 41 million kilo chocolate during Halloween.
Mays bones are the only thing we don't want to eat; but nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, the National Confectioners.
This represents approximately 9 billion grains of magic.
It's a mystery that I'm not coming to go.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than heat houses.
They bring the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), " Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shack".

Finally, let's talk about citros.
Charlie Brown presented us the Grosse Citro; when we were .. and sculpture a citro in the form of lanterne, it's like covering a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we're all small.
Happy for us, the "being-citro" trend was only started in the last year through Pinterest, so most of us have spared these potatoes and haven't been sitting inside.
This year, the Americans will cost about 106 M in citro ́s, U.S. Census Bureau.
The citro-lanternes who flourish doublely on your house's porch were probably from Itànois, where 542 million citros have been cultivated this year.
If you are trying to make more comments, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpture their 922 kg citro.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create internally a deficiency structure of 38 billion books (45 billion euros) of the most risked assets, aimed at detaining its relations with London and accelerating its re-privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce 55% to 70% the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance in the next two years and hopes that it has completely cleaned it in the three years.
RBS also stated that it would include a provision for depreciation of additional doubting credits from four to 4,5 billion books on the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also pointed out that this internal revolution would free from 10 to 11 billion capital books, thus strengthening its capacity to provide.
The Bank and London highlighted that the "bad bank" would allow a treaty on the past, particularly the government who was accused of joining the RBS management.
"We can now go from before, take care of the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a large bank for the customer and the United Kingdom," said the new general director Ross McEwan at the press.
Land Rover announces its parling of a series of railways
Inside there are seats of a baquet and 6-point-sheets, as well as a Intercom system.
Among the options, including improved breasts, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanisms, logistic support and the installation of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director-General of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The Bowler's railer friends have changed. ”
They are not all experimented, some are looking for excitation and aventure and real access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such a partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try in various forms of railways in the United Kingdom and the international, and to prepare for raid railways and realities.
We had much to enjoy developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championnate will really be palpitant. ”
Furthermore, the Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and tests in the February and the opportunity to participate in events in the North African and Middle East deserts.
The pumpers were called to safeguard a lost chiot after they remained 15 m over the ground on an instable corner in a carryer
Ruby, a Spanish cocker, was disappeared after an accident of the road without gravity
It was repeated three days later by a person who spent his dog in the carrier
The pumpers came down in memory the long of the foolish to recover the dog and save it from a certain death
A chiot had the chance to escape the worst after the pumpers were called to recover it in safety while it was because to 15 meters above the ground on the instable sail of a fala.
Ruby, a 9-month cocker spanish, disappeared after an accident of the road after Monday and survived for three days alone before he was saved in a midnight career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 years old, came to the Flappit carrier in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thank the Incendie and Summer Service in West Yorkshire.
They were unexpectedly searching for their lost dog and launching a call on social network sites after she was missing in the career after an accident without gravity.
On Wednesday 14,15, a person who was looking forwarded to his dog repeated Ruby on a corner in the career, covered at 15 meters above the ground.
A team of the Cleckheaton pumpy cartridge was running on the places and descended in memory to save Ruby by using a cave for animals to transport it to the top of the wallet.
Andy's technical securities specialist stated: "It was in a precursive situation."
It was in the middle of the middle of the floor, at 15 m of the top and 15 m of the ground.
She absolutely didn't move during the salvation – she was gelated.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits after.
It was a very rough call.
It's incredible that someone's noticed the dog.
Peter Lau said, "Ruby had a lot of chances to get out of freedom."
She could have been seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was conducted to the veterinary for control; its general state was satisfied, other than the dehydration and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by watching the trumpets."
I don't have to think she was there.
It was surprising to have it again in the arms.
The veterinary said that if she had been too exhausted and she was disappeared, she would probably fall.
The pumpers were amazing.
What they did was really courageous.
They're so amazing, each of them was absolutely amazable.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, said: "We were afraid that she falls but she didn't move."
The pumpers were great.
I can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger said he never drove Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an entrepreneur during an Australian radio emission this week, the pop star stated that she was chorist on the Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock's veteran and explained, "He drove me when I was 18."
She said, "It was a long time ago, and it was very lucky."
In a Thursday statement, a 70-year representative of Jagger stated that he had "not categorically made progress in Katy Perry".
The representative said, "It may be that she's confunded with someone else."
Perry was one of the songs to make an appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", was borrowed at the first place of cards this week.
Pekin with en cause a islamic movement Turkish guide
"The support in coulisses has come from the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan based on Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security bodies patron to a Hong Kong TV chain, a video set on Thursday night on a web site.
Meng Jianzhu, member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Party (PCC), was expressed in Tachkent during an official visit in Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese responsible designs a special organization after Monday expectation.
According to the Chinese police, three Uïghours of the same family of the Muslim dominant region of Xinjiang, the border of several Central Asian countries, predicted their car loaded by bidons against the entrance of the city prohibited in Pékin, in a suicide attack that made two dead and 40 wounded.
The car driver, his wife and his mother lost in the car's incendie.
The Etim, which states itself for the independence of the East Turkey, the ancient name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations associated with Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporading problems in Xinjiang, but its real influence is doubted by several experts.
George Kerevan: The European Location gives the choice to the Scotch
Another day, another anxious story of independence.
This time, we are predicted that an independent Ecosse would be able to join the European Free Area to be able to join the EU.
And here we hear the history of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbered sons through the wall of Hadrien.
If it is true that the Strathclyde journal indicated the possible economic retombys of a greater freedom of employment with the rest of Europe, it was not in the large titles (and it was to be predicted).
Nobody has said that the EU Member States have a large part of their time to turn their formal rules when they are set out.
Since the Ecosse is not part of the Schengen space for the moment, a continuous non-respect of the rules would be a mince consent that Brussels could offer in contrast to what she wants to the Scotch.
So it's a story that is not one.
And a so old story that she is now fixed: I have heard the bobard for the first time, which "indipendence means the control of passports" over 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old puzzle account.
Why should an independent Ecosse actually follow the instructions of Europe?
Why to exchange London's jug against Brussels, especially now?
This is the real presentation of Europe: the great after-government plan to join Europe is permanently dead.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Through Europe, the parties opposing the EU or fighting for the removal of the euro as a common devise win the land.
Even in Germany, the alternative Eurosceptial Party for Germany, which was based only this year and reached nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes in the federal elections of September and went out the Democratic Liberal Party (equivalent to our liberals-democracy) of Bundestag.
There is always a national opposition to the draft Federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis was a turning.
The exertity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcase on national economy through the unitary currency, led to many people to think that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro's crisis does not have a lot to see the national governments recording budgetary deficits – that was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has drawn up its members of the change rates favorable to the German exporters - what the German political men want to keep.
Without a possibility to evaluate the national decree, South European countries are faced with an internal productivity problem towards Germany.
The only resource is to make shadow cooks in the salaries and expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper disease related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subventing French and German energy sectors to consumer costs – the European industry pays two times more for election and four times more for gas than the United States.
It is an inconvenient restructuring in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All salaries in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry to be penalized by a well-market American skist gas.
As a result, the revolt, in particular in France, is one of the major leaders of the EU.
After war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a feet of equality with Washington.
But Berlin has no longer needed Paris as a passport of its political integrity and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, allowing the French economy to be wronged.
Result: The right extreme part of Marine Le Pen, the National Front Anti-European, has just received a crucial partial election, sending socialists to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffocations – an appropriate warning for the British Worklist Party that reminds him that it can not be from the principle that a separate right will automatically promote the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity at the French white work class?
It wants to use European elections in the next year to create a single and anti-European block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do good to these elections, what is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon the anti-European and unique anti-monnae feeling in Europe will be united and ended by killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more that will happen to the "Europe of the Nations (superfaces)" of the General of Gaulle's freedom.
Germany and some of its satellite economy could keep the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own department.
I believe that the United Kingdom takes its distances in relation to this project, and I hope he will make the United States fine eyes.
However, the growing interest of Washington for the fabrik allows you to think that the Great Britain will be left for account in Atlantic.
What about the Ecosse in all that?
We can decide to be a region of the smaller territory (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes the sending of Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that the Ecosse could welcome a more free European agreement as we keep our own department.
Cooperation with other countries in similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Nations Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP Government of Ecosse is – and it is to be noted – the political movement of anti-exterity that has been the best success in Europe, since it has received a majority of spectaculars in 2011 based on its opposite to the proposed shadow (and implemented) by the Chanceler of the Work Equity, Alistair Darling, and the coalition of conservators/democratics followed.
It would now be ridiculous for the Ecosse to vote for independence if it is to accept the exterity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Previous Pubertation: Better Previous
Studies show that young African and Spanish girls have tendence to reach the age of publicity as early as the white girls.
Changes do not mean that publicity is imminent
Nothing only proves hormones or other chemical substances are responsible
Experts believe that obesity epidemic may be a delayer of previous publicity
The trend to a previous puberty is not also announced in the boys
CNN Pat Etheridge is an expert journalist in the family and health issues of the child.
Should a mother be worried if the pubs and poultry of her daughter begin to be seven or eight years old?
During the annual conference of the American Agümy of Pediat, which was held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinolog, explained that these previous changes are sufficiently coherent among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I'm a lot of time to reassure parents – in general, it does not lead to a quick evolution to the full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
The evidence of development signs, such as the bourgeoning of the knifes, the pools under the arms and in the public area and the body bodies, appear early in girls.
But in the last four decades there was only an advanced age of the first rules.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and half, while it was 12 years old and three quarters in 1970.
“ When the poitrine began to develop, at least two or three years before the first rules appear, ” said Caplowitz, also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Co ́ with This Common Problem.
The time is the most precise test to know how publicity will develop.
There is a debate on what is the real appearance of publicity, but it is considered "previous" when the development of the poetrin is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, the development is relaxed or stops – it is something that a child can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justifie tests made by an endocrinolog to discard serious problems such as tumors or coasts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences: a pre-mature age of bones that can reduce growth and a small size at adult age.
The recommendations for medical and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, development rate, growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is aware of medicines, but it recognises that “the fact of control of publicity can reduce some behavior problems and feelings for young girls to be different from others”.
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of gravity or even the way they will handle hygiene issues," said Kaplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose daughter had the first rules at 10 years.
Even if there were signs and we had spoken of rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from the feared oil and was bound to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the knowledge of the public on the causes of previous publicity.
However, there is no coherent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, the chemicals present in the environment or the sex messages vehicleed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty before.
Caplowitz states that the most reliable hypothese is the of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on 6-9-year-old girls that lead the percentage of grass mass to the start of publicity.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other critical factors.
In this country, young African and Spanish girls have tend to reach the age of publicity as early as the white girls.
There are various explications.
At the world level, the mechanisms of previous puberty are affected by all, economic conditions at climate, by genes.
Other issues: Although boys have pools on the face and in the younger public area, the trend towards a real pre-real publicity is not as for girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of the acne and the pub pools is covering, even with food and all-speaks.
"We must be able to identifie the real appearance of publicity," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at the hospital for children of Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not ask their child's advice to know how to talk to their child.
“ This may mean to have a talk sooner than planned, ” explained Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
The girls who have previous publicity must be assured that, even when it happens before, the process is part of life.
The hostage to the people of the brothers Coen
"Inside Llewyn Davis" from the brothers Coen, the Grand Price of the Last Festival of Cannes, is a nostalgic and fun film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the music of people who just started to reson, before Bob Dylan's army.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose films have just made an object of a retrospective to the French Chinese, had discussed the Gold Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unless you can embarrass Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have cast their development on the star amount of the American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the pop Justin Timberlake planet star.
In this burned film of humor where music is a central person and songs directly interpreted, Oscar Isaac appears a musician and song of complete people, while Timberlake, his friend in the movie, leaves the pop for music people with a county jubilation.
As regards Carey Mu ·gan, she left the rich around Daisy Mu ·gan in "Gatsby the magnificent" for less reluctant clothes, a sweet voice when she sing, but the jury devoted to the mitraillet when she talks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" races on a week the tribulations of a people's song that can't be hungry with the whole earth.
He accepts the replacements of the feet raised in the studios.
Without apartment, he makes the turn of his friends' canapies who want to get it.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that is what we were interested in: a misfortune mixture, a guy who is not here at the right time, who is not carrierist but integral, with self-destructive behavior," said at the press Ethan Coen, cohorted with his brother Joel of several Oscars and price in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis doesn't exist, the two musician fans of people have found their story on real personalities of the time like the musician people Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time of the Greenwich village event, this quarter of New York called to become "the epicent of the musical esor of people who would be born of international stars" such as the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes a documentary time, a 33T invented music label, resided by an old secretary incapable, the musical choices of the studies of the time and the coffee where songs were produced.
The magic of the brothers Coen still works in integration with an amazing personality that is through the continuous movie: a beautiful red chat at the cracking look, a companion of Llewyn Davis' fortune.
Asked about how he composed his personality, the actor and song Justin Timberlake had reminded of having "grand in Tennessee, weakened by blue and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he said.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to be considered as good, "the hazard can also launch the career of someone," and "the more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who makes any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important is not to let us go through everything that can prevent us from expressing us."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He will never have known the retraite word.
Fénoway of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, died Thursday to 83, came just to hold his 200e SAS, "The Vengeance of Kremlin".
In February, New York Times had dedicated him as "the author of the spinners who knew it too much."
He was then spent ten days in Afghanistan, theater of 1998 and 199 works of the glorious series of spinners.
Reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved during this travel with a deambulator.
And before Afghanistan, he was also distributed in Libya, Russia, Liban and Mali.
Abec four SAS per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, was able to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, nearly a half century ago.
"No doubt between 120 and 150 million all confunded countries," he progressed last March.
His birman cat on the gentlemen, in the large room of his large apartment of an immortal of the Foch Avenue at two steps of the Triomph Arch, the malicious eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the SAS aventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Unless counting the pirate editions," he was designing a row of books on the low table between brass or ivoires reported from 130 arpented countries to acquire its Romans.
For the price of a cigarette package, the player has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman at the nice poitrine, with a gun or a assy area.
Inside, his serial higherness (SAS) prince Malko Linge, the disordered Austrian aristocrat and the contractual agent of the 日 to pay family chastisements, starts to the wounds of all the wicked in the earth, the 70s and the 80s, and then juadists from the 90s.
In each book, the same receipt is a large dose of geopolitic and exotic, some hard sex scenes, a severe violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I think I am a contemporary who writes for people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "as the big war reporters, of the type Albert London, who went and returned with real and long investigations."
The SAS father said "to make a genuine geopolitic faith."
"I am permanently my documents (Afghanistan, ...) before I leave," Gérard de Villiers.
On the other hand, I meet journalists, including the AFP, diplomates, people of the services I know for some of the twenty or thirty years.
Instead, the number of its SAS are often premonitional: so, a month before the attack of a Syrian regime's commandment center killing several higher responsibles, he had reported the story in the "The Path of Age".
In the "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret command center of the Â in this city, the beach of the Libyan rebellion.
In 1980, he scened the admonition of the Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in the "The Complot du Caire", a year before the expectation.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the 4X4 joadist columns based on Malean capital.
I'm not surprised, Gérard de Villiers defended, I'm just doing hypotheses from the countries I know well and some of my hypotheses have been accomplished for time.
Following these travels in often trooped areas, he was installed for a month behind his machine to write IBM margarite from 1976 "which parts have been scanned".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to it.
At the walls of his office, AK-47, Erotic photos and photos of the author with African war masters.
It is regularly used for machism by feminist links and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers separated them into two phrases.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intellectual and courageous women.
I'm still welcome in Africa, where I'm counting very many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said to him, "Malko Linge, like all the heroes, has no age."
He will not die, he will not go back.
Not more than me.
Aeroplaners care about the width of the seats while large commands are in play
The dispute makes anxiety between the large aircraft manufacturers on the width of the tourist class's seats on the long-cour flights, opening the road to an amazing confrontation in the Dubai aircraft room that is located in this month.
The conflict leads to the width of the seats proposed on long-cour flights to the passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most corroborated by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the last equipment presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called the airline industry to establish a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 pounds (45,72 cm) in the economic classes, but its large US Rival Boeing says that it should be for air companies to decide.
The difference was exclaimed while aircrafts are trying to sell even larger versions of their long-cour bimotor aircrafts, hopeing for a record of orders in the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be available behind the plane – in particular if there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo segment”.
Boeing says that his reamenated "777X" will be able to collect 406 people in seats of more than 17 pounds of width, and will be configured with 10 seats per range.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of A350 will transport 350 people in economic classes of 18 pounds of wide range 9.
Aeronautical agents often interact on technical issues by making publicity in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai airport room, where 777X should take steps on his competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently been able to realize what could be the beginning of a new public war with the presentation of a picture's finance showing three people each other in the restaurant, entitled "Will you accept this?".
“Boeing offers long-cour flights in higher seats than in regional tourist aircrafts, ” said John Leahy, Airbus Commercial Director.
As food habits change, people grow, but seats in the aircraft haven't been radically changed.
During the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing Jumbo 747 defined the modern long-cour travel, and the turning of the century, the average weight of the United States has increased by 10%, the data of the American Department of Health.
The middle American average tour of the 20th century is 39.7 pounds, and the American health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival increases to a seat concept dated in the 1950s, when the surrounding of the freshly baptized “jet set” was more heavy.
Airbus has commanded a study that indicates that an additional powder at the width level of seats would improve the quality of the sleeping of 53%.
Boeing contests the Airbus numbers in relation to the width of the seats and claims that it is not for the manufacturers to decide how air companies equilibrate the price of billets and equipment.
He also states that the study shows that cabin experience does not depend on the width of the seats.
"It is really to be brought to the aircraft firms and to allow them to do what they think to do to make their activities well," Kentitéver said, as a result of the satisfaction of passengers at Boeing.
They don't want to tell them what they'll be rentable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more to have a certain freedom of movement, but for providers it is more than one question that could affect their results.
After the dispute, a course is hidden for aircraft orders for a amount of at least 700 Md$ at the market price in the next decades, sufficiently to reduce the US and European export balance.
As Re re repeated for the first time in July, the setup of seats is exactly what feeds the battle between all the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing are both returning one seating in their last models of long-cour bimotors 20% above the market leader in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The annual performances of Boeing are part of the comparison between 777X configured with 10 seats per range and a 777 model of origin set in range 9.
The winning in terms of unitary costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats in the current service.
"Boeing does this to be able to acquire more seats and make its more competitive aircraft in relation to our products," Kevin Keniston, Confort Passager director at the European Airbus Airbus Airbus.
On the other hand, the analysts say that the cabines configured with 10 seats per range in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers speak for a deeper configuration, which can go with less lovers tariffs.
"A width of 18 pounds would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, in commercial view, the proposal of Airbus is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert inside cabines Mary Kirby, founder and editorial leader of Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines must choose.
Aeroplane sellers who make the world tour even bring a meter with them to check competitive configurations.
In order to offer comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer aircrafts with strong density configurations to low-cost and regional travel companies.
Airbus offers a A350 configured with 10 seats in a range but indicates that he has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus highlighted the need for a larger personalization of cabines by offering larger seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only large modern large device manufacturer, experts say that it's small that it's called to the air industry in order to establish a standard of size for seats, but that it could forget the 777X vine wake.
Oracle's shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle's actors voted on Thursday against the proposal for refunding for the funding and Director-General Larry Ellison, taking into account its financial performances.
The vote is not contrary, but it's coming to cut the picture of Larry Ellison, the third global fortune just aurolous of the victory of his ship at the Cope of America.
The billion has still 25% of the capital of the software group that he has co-funded 40 years ago.
The last year Ellison had voted negatively on his recompense.
The Oracle patron rejected a $1,2 million for the 2013 year closed due to the bad results of the group, which missed its growth objectives, but it had estimated about $77 million associated with stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
On the 2013 decade year, the net benefit of Oracle progressed with 3.5% while the 27.5% Bourse currency, which overcomes the S&P-500, which took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the place of smoking
Some scientists developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that a cigarette is taken to smoke.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect the mouse from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before starting the tests on human being, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cor ։ Medical College of New York stated that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this type of vaccinal strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop today with all the methods available on the market, but they discover that their addiction is sufficiently strong to overcome these various approaches," said Professor Cor.
The new vaccine contains an immune virus used to transport the necessary genetic information to design anti-nicotine anticorps.
The virus is selectively infected with the cells of the feed, which then begins to produce a regular anticorps flow.
Anticorps trace all nicotine moles presented in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having his nicotine dose.
During tests, the vaccinated mouse to which nicotine was then given has normally continued their activity.
But the mouses that have not been vaccinated were "paused," said the researchers, signed that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiences are described in the translational Medical Science.
Ineffective vaccines against tobacco have occurred because they contained anticorps.
Injections are repeated so often so that anticorps levels remain high that they were too honorable and less practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be very lower because it transforms the cells of the feed into anticorps.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future human use vaccine was completely secure, it could be given to children before they were tried to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it's more efficient than it is used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start again to smoke, they will not take any pleasure in it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will help them lose their bad habits," he said.
British scientists claimed that the results were interesting, but reported that much higher research needed.
The leader of the Pakistanians killed by a drone
Hakimullah Mehsud has been killed in a freight-feeding American drone in Pakistan.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death was a number of times since the past.
But responsible for information, army and activist movement confirmed this time he had lost life in this flag, held in the North-Wazstan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone thread," said a high responsibility for security.
The guard, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, moved to London, had informed the British Government that discussions had been engaged with the Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of the Pakistanian Taliban.
Tripodi should not be influenced by Obeid
The former workshop minister of New-Gales of South Joe Tripodi will be subject to an investigation of the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former Minister of New Galles of South Joe Tripodi refused to have the trade policy on the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three goods in the area controlled by the government.
Wednesday, the Indian Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its request to know whether Mr. Obeid had pressed several State ministers to renew his balls in Circular Quay, where Obeid had two restaurants and a café, after their expiry in 2005, without a call.
She now examines the allocations which Mr. Tripodi was in the secret interest of Mr. Obeid in these properties, after the witnessing of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the Government pressed the balls to make a call for offers.
Locators were opposed and wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the balls relating to Circular Quay firms, reporting to Obeid about 2,5 M per year, have been renewed without calling for offers.
Mr. Tripodi, minister of the Ports of February 2006 in November 2009, was favorable to offer calls.
But he refused to have changed his policy on Mr. Obeid's request, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, claimed a change in the governmental policy in the field of balls.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls passed in aula and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a high officer who came to the Port Minister after working under M Obeid's orders in the Ministry of Peace.
"The subject discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the trade policy?", asked Adjoint Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“ No, ” Mr. Tripodi answered.
I don't remember what we were talking about, but in any case, it wasn't that.
In any case, it is certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli war aircraft goes to the goal, says a responsible
Israeli war aircraft reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening, confirming a military responsibility at Fox News.
The responsibility did not define the objective, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian production missiles SA-125.
At least two times this year, Israel led aircrafts against miscellaneous loads.
Foreign workers in possession of a vision 457 may have a "authenticity test" test
The Government now studies the possibility of establishing an authenticity test for foreign workers in possession of a vision of 457 while it intends to extend the repression measures.
The test, if it is adopted, would apply a criteria to prevent the 457 visuals of being used to occupy non-qualified posts or as a declined means to make his family and friends coming inside.
A Government's work document has been issued today, while Mr Maxine McKew was referring to the governmental talk on foreign workers, saying that he could offend the neighbors of Australia.
"The failing statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the row" and "employment for the chairmans" are an unfair return at the time when the syndicats requested a protected work market," she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historyly, this means that the work of Blas should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historical artefact.
The work document states 12 measures which had been considered by the former Imigration Ministry of Chris Bowen.
The Ministry of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet high responsibles in order to discuss trafficking of human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, while others are in examining.
If the "authenticity" criteria was adopted, a visa applicant could be controlled to know "if the offer of employment is authentic in the case where the candidate is a relationship or a personal association of the owner or person concerned within the company who sponsors it".
Companys may also be able to state the number of 457 visibility holders after some of them, having intention of sponsoring a small number of employees, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year sri-lankais asylum applicant would die from a heart crisis after he arrived on a ship transporting asylum applicants to Christmas Island this week.
The beloved son of the man, who was nine years old, came to him and found comfort from the death of his father on Thursday with a adult wife who was also on board.
The man was urgency transferred by the Australian authorities to the Hospital of the Christmas Island, where he was dead.
A study aimed at multipliing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Ecosse was held by the British Government.
The work performed by HS2 Ltd allows to think that high speed services to Ecosse and North England will begin from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Barone Transport Minister Kramer stated that the project would "reduce the United Kingdom".
The Spanish Ministry of Transports, Keith Brown, said "excitate" to the idea of working with the British Government on the project.
The phase 1 will be on a new railway line with great speed between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is finished, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revealed the estimated cost of the large-speed connection between London and North of England, which was 32.7 Md £ to 42.6 Md £.
The British Government, who is talking to Scotland Transport, requested HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and improve the time of travel for northern England and Ecosse.
This must include the possibility of traveling between Glasgow and Edimbourg for three hours ago.
The Kramer baron said: "Our objective for HS2 is on a really national network that will draw close to the United Kingdom and its cities."
We move the HS2 project because the benefits he presents are great.
Without him, we are confronted with a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also to develop connectivity between the 18 large British cities, including Glasgow and Edimbourg, so that the links between them be better through HS2.
The British State Secretary for Ecosse, Alistar Carmichael, said: "The news of today is a good news for the Ecosse."
For the Spanish Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support the Ecosse network in HS2.
Mr. Brown said: "The high speed train has the potential to offer significant economic benefits to the Ecosse, but it also provides the weight of the Ecosse in the global railway network project with great speed throughout the United Kingdom.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government in order to examine the options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotia, creating a benefit for all and completing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Spanish Government is already planning.
"I am impatient to read the Examen report with the British Ministers next year, and we will then decide in the next steps."
The rules relating to the use of board electronic apparatus remain in force
Australian aircraft passengers will continue to remove their tablets and smartphones during the collection and landing despite the United States' management to approve the regulation on electronic devices.
The Federal Aviation Aviation of America has left the open door to the American transporters for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during the critical flight phases, provided they are in a "aeroplane" mode.
The passengers can already do it during the largest part of the flight, but many people find that they cannot access their electronic books during the collapsing and landing.
Australian transporters examine the decision that requires American transporters to carry out an important work in order to comply with the requirements, but they indicated that they did not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that she examined the announcement but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment during critical flight phases were still in force.
"The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electrical equipment in a plane," she said.
The question concerns a regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of security and the passengers to respect the security records given by the team members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to the CASA about its intention to extend the use of its board divertising system using Wi-Fi, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that this would improve the client experience now that we have (using Wi-Fi's board divertment system) on our aircraft," a portfolio stated.
Cantas stated that she had respected the current rules for the time.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during the collapsing and landing, and we do not intend to change it immediately," she said.
The decision of the FAA applies to American aircraft companies.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit the passengers, and we will consider closely the decision of the FAA and the reasons for this.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from a flying company to another and depend on the age of their float.
Transporters must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interferences from electronic apparatus, as well as revision of manuals, training materials, hand baggage transport programmes and passenger consignments.
"When a airline has verified the tolerance of its float, it may allow passengers to use portable electronic equipment, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all heights," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the team will request passengers to remove their equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended that the weakest devices be broken in safety under the seats or in the higher levels during collapsing and landing.
Pia: at least four wounds in a violent bagarre
The little commune of Pia has known an excection of fibre Thursday evening.
Three gendarmery vehicles, two ambulances and a trip of a thirty persons; the witnesses collected...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was agitated at Pia's side, where a rix that includes several people was stuck on the post side.
At least four wounded ones would be to deplore.
Alerted, gendarms came to the place to separate the beliers and to ensure that the wounds are supported.
Singapore's gage providers benefit from the limited cross-border classes
In the case of a trading officer of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga presents a bracelet, a bague and a couple of gold ear bucks to pay the school costs of her daughters.
"My husband and I have been buying a house, so all my money has gone in," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she wins $3,000 from Singapore (2,400 dollars) per month as a administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income does not suffice, she says.
In fact, the request is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where the dealing of households increases – that ValueMax, where it has made its transaction, became the third loans in the country of Singapore.
The gaining of bioux is not just a rapid means of liquid money – $1 300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is almost a good market as not guaranteed loans.
Generally, Singapore's payers have a effective annual interest rate of 17 %, just over 15,4 % offered by the United Overseas Bank, a largest of local funds with a contribution in the same commercial center.
However, payment providers have the advantage of not requesting solvency checks or payment evidence, and they can discover the loans more rapidly than the banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region turn to employees on the gage, while families feel the pressure of life costs and delaying the homes and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the world financial crisis, and the good market credit feeded by a too laxistic monetary policy in advanced economys, low and medium-sized income families turn to the purchases in order to comply with the difference, while their economy knows a ralencing.
This week, the Standard & Poor's notation agency has quoted the growing end of households, which is mainly of the increase of hypoth-equipments, such as a risk factor for the solvency of the Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had finally recorded the largest brutal domestic households/product in Asia.
Malaysia reaches a list of 80 % of the PIB, while the rate was 60 % in 2008.
Economys also fear the high level of consumer detention in Thailand, which has recently been out of a technical recession this week.
Thursday, data showed a continuous weakness of exports and a rating of consumers' request.
"The balance is that with the increase of the costs, people in the middle or below [of the salaries scale] are trying to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, economicist at the CIMB, a Malaysia bank.
Historyly high prices of gold during the last two years have made people pressure to carry out their personal effects to touch the value in species of their birds.
In Singapore, approximately 70 per cent of the articles in the 200 loans on the town's gage are in gold.
People say, “The price of gold is high, let's put the chain in gold of grandmother, and we'll return to search for it next month. ”
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest loan boots operator, has recorded an increase of 20% of the number of customers using their boots during the last months.
The growth is such in the loan sector that ValueMax, bottle operator in Bendemeer and 15 other boots like this in Singapore, intends to develop not only in the neighborhood Malaysia – where he already counts four bottles – but also outside Asia, says Ja Lee Ching, his general director.
The company will finance them by using 60% of the 66 M$ of Singapore that she raised this week in its introduction to Singapore.
While some lower rate suppliers have exercised criticisms for the exorbiting interest rates they practice, Ms. Yes, it indicates that the payment offers not only less rate than the other suppliers, but also does not directly carry out the debt.
"Clients hypotheque the goods they have already, and the fact that they currerate their personal property does not make the deal of the households," she says.
Enhancement is better accepted socially as a means of a short-term financing.
Persons who come to the trainers are not even those who have financial problems.
Easy people in Singapore are also going to the loan buckets on ValueMax to take the garage of gold lingotes or Rolex hours, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase prices in species.
We see clients from all the company's beds.
"It may be appealed people who need short-term impression for commercial activities or investment, or small enterprises who need treasure to pass a difficult head," Mrs. Ja.
Sometimes, they just need money very quickly.
Appealed pastor of youth pornography in New Ecosse
A pastor who cared for young people, in the region of Halifax in New Ecosse, is accused of young pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, age of 30, was arrested on Friday morning after questioning at his home and at the National Research Council office.
The baptism church of Timberlay, where the shepherd was official, was deeply attracted by this news.
In one case, the church responsibles indicate that Mr. Hudgins has dismissed his post.
The shepherd was released under conditions.
It must, in particular, not be involved with persons less than 18 years and not access to the Internet.
It will compare in the provincy core in Halifax in December.
He becomes in a nazi uniform at the supermarket, before it is cast
A man dressed by a nazi uniform from a brassard with the gamma cross was asked to leave a supermarket →, and customers were complained at the direction of the establishment who called the police, indicated the Friday magazine.
"We received several customers' claims, so we asked him to leave the magazine," explained a portfolio of the supermarketing chain of Asda.
The magazine called the police to the rescue, but "the time she's coming, he's already gone without scandal," she said.
I was doing the cow when I saw a woman that seemed crazy.
People were a good mouth.
"You don't go out this way in the street unless you want to draw attention," a client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, showed at the Cambricula News journal.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of Halloween's festival, where it is costume to go out in a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A man of Cambria rejected the responsibility of this act on his Twitter account, where he put pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I have a black SS brassard two times a week ago with Asda," Paul Dutton stated, explaining "mentional problems".
Rescue plan of 325 M$ for Tasmanie's health system
The Federal Government maintains that the safeguard plan of $325 for the vacillant health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the Government of the State will not lose funds.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that Commonwealth now takes urgent measures to end a crisis caused by the age of the population of the island, the high rate of chronic diseases and the limits of the system.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after consultations of the Government with the independent member of Tasmanie, Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has proposed a plan of emergency salvation which, we, will regulate the unique difficulties with which the State is confronted," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The plan of 325 M$ includes a 31 M$ campaign for non-necessary chirurgical operations.
2 600 additional operations, in particular in the field of orthopedic and cataractic surgery, will help to discontinue the loss.
Funds are also intended for clinics without meeting in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical frameworks, mental health services and the development of electronic medical dossier systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to the first-line clinics, it is the best way to monitor the Tasmanie health system," Mrs. Plibersek said.
The Minister claimed that the Government of Tasmania would be confronted with a strict system of preparation of reports and revision of accounts.
The State must maintain the current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth's money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it costs additional funds.
A committee composed of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most effective and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 will not be counted for a major choice "unless they are followed by a real reform that allows the public health system of Tasmanie to be consolidated".
However, he welcomed the Government for responding to the urgent aid request that he had submitted to the Prime Minister in beginning of May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to restore the public health system of Tasmanie from the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-necessary procedures will increasingly reverse the recent coupes.
But the portfolio of the opposition on health, Peter Dutton, thinks that today's announcement is a "confort solution".
"The reason why we are here is that the State's workshop government has retrieved $430 from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
It is not possible to have a government of the State that takes almost a half-mild dollar and the Commonwealth which is $300, and it is a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollars from the backup plan will be costed in additional bureaucracy.

The Commission has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, says the monitoring
The Challenge destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas munitions, stated the international monitoring of chemical weapons on Thursday, while violent conflicts were in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents should be stored.
A group of Syrian soldiers also stated Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country about 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) has occurred with an advanced day on the date of limitation of the
On 1 November, the organization based on the Haye order to destroy or "inutile" all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gases and to fill municipalities.
The end of what is mainly the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitional calendary to destroy chemical weapons from here mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, it will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the destruction of existing weapons and reservations must still be started.
It is considered that the country has approximately 1,000 tonnes of products and chemical weapons, including motard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made when fights were wounded on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, experts, opens a production unit of chemical weapons and storage sites, reported the Syrian observer of the rights of the Man based in Great Britain.
The group of soldiers, following the development of human balance through a military network based on Âe, stated Thursday that 120 296 people were dead.
Among them, there are 61 067 civils, including 6 365 children.
On the side of the Government, 29 954 members of the military forces of President Bachar el-Assad found death, whose 18 678 were warriors of pro-governmental forces and 187 of the Libanese Hezbollah military.
Among the dead, it is also considered that 2 202 were deserts and about 5 375 fighters of opposition, of which many were strangers.
On 25 July, the United Nations considered that 100 000 people were dead in the conflict since March 2011.
She has not updated this number since.
About 2 million people had to escape the country because of conflict.
El-Assad's groups stand against the rebels, with a number of people associated with Al-Qida network groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated Thursday that there were losses from both sides, but did not give any precision.
The fights highlighted the importance of the dangers to which the chemical weapons inspectors are confronted while they have to purchase their mission, which consists of delaying its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that loses, in deteriorated periods.
A statement of the OIAC, who works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "comfortable to have controlled – and has been destroyed – all the critical production and machines intended for mixing and filling”.
It said that “no other inspection activities were foreseen for the time”.
Before the week, the inspectors said that they had completed the first stage of the checking work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites stated by.
They could not visit the last two sites because of concerns about their security, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, the OIAC said that the two sites were “abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained were moved to other stated sites, which were inspected”.
It was difficult first to know if the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the OIAC inspectors could not visit.
A total destruction plan of its chemical weapons was adopted in the following month by the OIAC Excipient Committee.
"I welcome the moral force and courage you all have shown in the most difficult mission of this organization," said the Director-General of the Organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment from the OIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war is mainly opposed to the Muslim rebellion of the Government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alauite Section, a cheese of the Chiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observeratory of Human Rights stated that there was a strong midnight explosion in a air defense base in the Syrian coast province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he said.
Worm caused by the penalty pronounced against one of Bali's bombing holders
The surgeons and neighbors of the 202 killed in Bali's attendance in 2002 reacted with anger against the last of the conspirators to be translated into justice, saying that Umar Patek should be furnished by an executive bottle.
Patek, who was almost 10 years of refuge by being one of the most searched men from Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a penalty of 20 years of prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive engines used in waiting.
It could be released at the end of 15 years under conditional freedom.
The 45-year-old man was recognized of mass murdering for the expectations of two night boxes in the popular tourist quarter of Kuta, which caused death of 202 persons, including 88 persons, and made many hurt.
It was also recognized that many other guilty leaders were guilty of terrorism, including a wake of waiting for churches throughout the Indonesia at Christmas Watch in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a perpetuity penalty, but they could have asked that the man, qualified of "Demolition Man" for his representation of experts in the production of bombs, would be condemned to death.
The decision devised penitent memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost his two 39-year-old jane and Jenny in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators about 10 years ago.
At the border of the lamps, she said Patek should have been condemned to death.
I really think he should have followed the same way as the other men.
"He should be treated before the Implementing Bottle," Mrs. Corteen said to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other kids or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a big bomb, loaded in a foreign wallet, was explosed just after 23 hours on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Pa's Bar when a kamikaze has made a shot with two loaded explosives at least 20 seconds earlier.
He shot into the coma on the next day of the waiting and remained unconscious for a month, and he was “dead” three times while he was under spirit assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek had to know the same sort as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Prim Samudra – who were exempt 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been condemned to death before others.
Keep it alive, why, there is no reason to keep it alive.
For 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurt hundreds of others, it's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombing holders to be translated into justice.
He had succeeded to avoid capture for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistanian city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill Al-Qida, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.
An FBI agent said that reports of information services had been shown that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore connections between South East Asia terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't come," Mrs. Corteen said.
Until recently, he was disappointed by the threat he could have caused others.
The verdict was made to the 10th anniversary of attendants that will be collected later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and inside.
“ This year will be a lot of weeping, ” Mrs. Corteen said.
However, Patek can call on his condemnation.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft garages (but don't pass a call with their phone)
Aeroplane passengers will be able to use their port-port electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch films and listen to music – but not talking on their mobile phone – in accordance with the newly expected directives on Thursday by the Federal Aviation.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be made varied from a flying company to the other, said the FAA administrator Michael Huerta during a press conference.
Aeroplane companies must prove to the FAA that their aircraft respects the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of equipment members and the rules on the assembly of equipment to be in accordance with.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain aircraft companies to expand the use of electronic equipment on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies who have already undertaken plans.
“In the light of the plan, we could approve an extensive use of electronic devices very closely, ” the FAA stated in a statement.
Currently, passengers must remove their smartphones, tablets and other apparatus since the doors of the airport are closed.
They are not supposed to break them before the plane reaches a height of 10000 feet and the commander gives its green fire.
The passengers are supposed to cut off their apparatus when the airplane is deceived before the aircraft and do not break them up until the airport has been placed.
In accordance with the new directives, aircraft companies whose aircrafts are properly protected from electronic interferences may allow passengers to use their equipment during the trailing, aircraft and land rolling, stated the FAA.
Most of the new line aircrafts and other aircrafts that have been carried out in order to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher heights should satisfy criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Appendants, has been happy about these changes.
“ Once the new security policy is implemented – and we will work closely with transporters – it will benefit everyone, ” Glading explained in a statement.
We are sincerely fatigued to feel as “room overseers” when this is the question.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet for surfer, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10 000 feet, the Agency stated.
The passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices.
So not always Words With Friends, the online Scrabble game where the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was exhausted with a big voice from a American Airlines Airlines Airlines after he had disabled his device while the camera was guarded at the door.
And the worst devices like portable computers will always be broken because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Board phones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power on portable phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not to the FAA.
FAA can lead to the prohibition on certain electronic equipment during collection and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of National Transport Safety Board, national CBS News Transport Safety Expert, stated that mobile phones were always considered as a risk.
"Portable phones are actually a problem, not only because they could eventually create interferences with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disturb mobile phone antennes if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
A industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended that the Government authorize a larger use of personal electronic devices.
The heavy pressure on the FAA has been strengthened during the last years to sustain the restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator McCaskill, D-Mo., support that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
The restrictions are also more difficult to apply because the use of equipment has become all-president.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers forget to remove their equipment, or make it deliberately.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic apparatus in 1996 after reports on the presence of interferences with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transported FM radios, the high-tech gadget.
New online aircrafts are much more electrical systems than generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.
Aeroplane companies allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi for several years.
Aeroplanes to receive Wi-Fi systems are also better resisting interferences.
The large majority of online aircrafts should allow the use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transfers much lower than the generators of equipment.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when a page turns.
But transmissions are stronger when teleporting or sending data.
Amazon.com is part of those who pressure to abolish the restrictions relating to the use of electronic equipment by passengers.
In 2011, the leaders of the company loaded a online aircraft from childle electronic book readers and made it steal to see if there were problems, but there was no one.
This inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee of feelings mixed on the question of whether the use of equipment is a risk.
Douglas Kidd de la National Propertyation of Airline Passengers said that he thought the interferences from equipment were real, even if the risk was minimum.
Other members of the Committee stated that there are only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that the devices can interfere with a plane systems and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorize the drivers to request the passengers to remove their equipment during the attractions to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them full of good sense arrangements for travelers equipped.
"We are happy that the FAA is that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and director of the U.S. Travel.
A heliterated bird of a northern sea-form platform was released in nature
A bird, heliterated after having been found out on a oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
The water rail was made up at the border of a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was sent by the Spanish SPCA in its Alloa salvation center.
Colin Seddon, director of the Centre, stated: "This water rail was probably a winter halt that came from northern Europe and found himself in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea."
It is that the evaporated bird would have succeeded to find refuge on the oil-form platform.
He said: "He was unable to revolve, so we were contacted to bring our help."
The water rail was well healthy when it was released.
Is the European Elite ready to do business with Great Britain?
The Business campaign for British has been held in April with the promise to meet companies and to define what the creators of richness and employment want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To do so, we commanded the largest and fullest request to the British business leaders and asked them what they thought about the Great Britain, the companies and the EU.
YouGov asked more than 1.000 business leaders, globally representatives of all companies, sectors and regions in Great Britain.
The conclusions of the question will be a surprise for many.
We have discovered that the large majority of companies are currently seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that modernize and develop while EU States stand.
They want to see the Government to provide new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to enlarge themselves in the long and heavy process of reform of European institutional arcs.
When they are asked of their opinion on specific political points – from the regulation of monopols to products laws – most business leaders think that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has caused a general misunderstanding, and companies say that the cost of Brussels Regulation is disproportionated in comparison with the benefits that are to be part of the European trade area – 40% of the largest companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even agreed.
Finally, and what is more talking about, our investigation with business leaders showed that a major majority would like to see Greece to continue the initiatives for a change in the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not on policy.
This conclusion, which is located in all large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the world of the company insists on a "significant change" that renewed the power to the United Kingdom.
Injuries are high – to change the Treaty and to better represent the interests of the Great Britain would be allowed to see 16% of votes for the maintenance of the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not give one instinct: this question shows that British companies support this plan to renew the terms of Great Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power to return to the United Kingdom's hands.
It is possible, and more needed, to better represent the interests of the British enterprises, since the euro area is committed to the way of a stronger economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be the employment and growth in Greece, and, as the conclusions of our investigation show it, for companies it means to resume the focus on trade and a change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
United States of Halloween Colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from Halloween tradition.
Avec his wife, last night, he distributed frendis to hundreds of children invited in the gardens of the Maison-Blanche in Washington.

Alexei Miller de Gazprom says that the gasoduc of Bulgaria is a new ear of the gas
The beginning of the construction of South Stream Gas in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, stated Gazprom director.
“An historical event has occurred today: The construction has started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gasoduc, the largest scale project of Europe,” explained Alexei Miller, the General Director of Gazprom, in a Sunday statement.
This project is a key element of energy security of the European continent.
South Stream should be allowed to diversify Russia's export paths to Europe.
A contractual difference between Gazprom and its Ukrainian approval, the country through which the largest part of the Russian Gas for Europe is transiting, increases the risk level compared to conventional ways, the director.
Miller said that the direct association to Bulgaria, member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream Gas to a reduced tariff since the project will be served in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that the building should be started in other countries in the end of the year.
The gas was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubes of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday The News of Tahiti, which provides a radio-information.
This is the last British territory of the South African Republic, at the east of the architecture of the French Polynesia, in the middle road between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2 if there are three other small islands nearby.
He is British since his occupation in 1790 by the Mutiners of the Bounty, episode of the history of the English marine, which has occurred to three hollywoodian adaptations.
A few tenths of residents, most of Bounty's seeds, are still living in Pitcairn, and their income is 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Iceland voted for the establishment of a marine reservation around the small pile, or 836.000 km2 corresponding to its economic area.
A member of the Master Island went to London to ask the Great Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Major of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the Governing Board of Pitcairn, resi日 in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such marine reserves would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836.000 km2, however, with the condition that they have the means to ensure monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircrafts dedicated to the area's monitoring, and there is no port where to place military supervisory vessels.
As regards France, it must already carry out the very costly air and maritime monitoring of five million km2 of the French Polynesia ZEE, neighbor of Pitcairn.

Living prison for an ancient Chinese Governor
An ancient Governor of the province of Jilin, north-east of China, was sentenced on Friday to the prison for corruption.
Excluded by the Partie in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million powder yuanes, reporting the Chinese official media.
Since 1995 and 2001, the Governing Board, who was also President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, assisted companies and responsible for contracts, loans or promotions in exchange of money or credits, stated the first intermediate court of Pekin on his microblog.
President Xi Jin, who took his functions in March last, made a national priority, estimating that the phenomena was a threat to the existence of the Partie.
If the Chairman of the State promised that justice would be also intra-idible with the powerful "tigres" as with the "mouchs" - high-alternatives - only a pound of high-range responsibles were condemned, among whom ancient oil gender oil.
The recently spectacular case was the former leader of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, condemned to live in September for corruption and abuse of power after having taken the highest functions in the State.
However, the Government has no longer demonstrated the intention of reforming the system of fight against corruption by creating, for example, an independent body of the party.
Two employees of YMCA accused of sexual agressions after allocations made against Jonathan Lord during a audience of the Royal Commission.
Two employees from the YMCA of New Gualls of South have been accused of sexual agressions against children after allocations made against the Educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, during an audience of the Royal Commission of sexual abuse on children.
However, in its opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that he had never had a problem of sexual agression on children in his organization.
The Director-General Phillip Hare was asked about two cases: A YMCA employee was accused of infringements relating to child pornography and an educational monitor of YMCA Caringbah Hall was recognized for sexual agressions on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare said to Gail Furness, a lawyer advocate to the Commission, that he had known the first case but that he was not at the point of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA opening statement was unexpected by sublineing, "YMCA's external controls were carried out and indicated that children's safety was an absolute priority for the organization. "
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that he had received the most bad appreciation for four institutions in a review of the quality of the Department of Education and Communities performed in this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at 21 years of age, admitted that the management of the staff was a failure with the Lord's recruitment and that he had not been able to verify that his employees were able to report any violation of the children's security policy.
Before the year, Lord was condemned for sexual agressions on twelve boys for the two years when he worked in YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum six-year prison penalty.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that YMCA would have a cultural problem to prevent the staff from reporting the missing of the Lord to the safety of children.
The members of the staff proved that they had observed some missing, especially the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, put them down on his gentlemen, said to them that he loved them and let them play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was in the framework of the Lord and who had requested training for children's protection because she was concerned about her behavior, indicated that she was the responsible for the services at the child’s YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which would enhance Lord “is very intimidant and difficult to draw close to most of the time”.
The Director-General said that he rejected the witnesses of the staff which they were retained to report these missing to their superior hierarchic.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relationships they experienced with the Lord broke their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his view in front of the YMCA Council of New Gualls of the South, saying that, for the organization, the lesson of the "Incidence Jonathan Lord" should not refer to "the signal" by the staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to subscribe to the staff of confidentiality agreements, shortly after the claims were issued, was taken by the Director-General of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence elements, but that it was a "excess of zeal" and that it had been wrongly implemented.
The YMCA of New Galles of South was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, stated the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Hallbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "severe problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of the staff.
The audience was updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would have the opportunity to return to Prime Minister, but he recognises that his return is little.
In the last night of his fifth anniversary at the end of his mandate, 59-year-old man reported his opinion on various national policies.
Since he went in June 2007 after a decade to the head of the country, Mr. Blair broadly avoided discussing the British Policy, limiting its comments to foreign matters and its special sending role from Quatuor for the peace process in the Middle East.
When he was asked if he would like to find the Prime Minister's post, Mr. Blair would have answered, and the Evening Standard of London would say: "Yes, of course, but it could happen, so..."
When many eccstasy experts gathered together in Cardiff to face and take the horse of the Year's horse, they know that competition would be brutal.
But no one had to see win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child.
Not yet in the oil and only a few months after making his first weapons, the whole-speak and his pony Shetland Toffee treated during the three rounds with a great facility and received the first price, left behind them the 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and attitude in the annual concours that was developed in the Sunnybank Equestre centre, Rudry near Cardiff.
When he was present against men and women in legitimate melon hair, he brought his plate casket a little on the side uncontractedly to screw his pony Toffee age of 2 years around the track.
Fenton was welcomed by the judges for his natural qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee in gift for his third birthday in March last and entered from his pony Shetland every day.
His mother, Donna, 30 years old, said: "Fenton and Toffee are doing an excellent duo."
They presented themselves against and against everyone, but both reflected the goat and the rose.
It was just the second time he concurred with Toffee and we were fools of joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to photograph with him.
This young boy, from the town of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of the Galles country, follows the tracks of his tante Sharon Howells, who participates in equesters for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said: "There was choice in the air, and everyone encouraged it and approved it."
He parked the whole length of the track, and even if it seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful work.
Fenton is foolish of animals – he loves the horses, tractors and the rural world and has two bottles that he cares for.
In the way he started, he will soon participate in the manifestation of the Year's Heaven – and I am sure he will make a beautiful performance.
A port-word of the annual squester manifestation stated: "Fenton has only 3 years but he knows how to drive his pony."
They form a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee had a good presentation and the way they shot on the track.
They are looking for an effective team work between the pony and the dresser – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud to go.
A Chinese journal that launched a call " will be refunded"
A Chinese journal that launched a call on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of diffamation will be recovered, says a press regulator.
The New Express based on Guangzhou has a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen then admitted the television that he had accepted powder-wins to make stories about a half-public society.
Now the New Express will have a "complete recompense", stated the regulator.
The order for "reserve" is the Guangdon administration for Presse and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had made several misunderstood articles on the Zoomlion County Society between September 2012 and 2013.
“ The New Express editor was deceived, ” said the regulator in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided to impose a administrative sanction in Chen Yongzhou by repairing his press card.
He also “recommended to the Yangcheng Evening News group to carry out a complete review of New Express, and recommended that it conduct a question of the persons responsible to New Express and immediately repeat the newspaper direction team”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the financial irregularities assumed by a songing engine manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper made two times a first-page call for his release, writeing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a television chain where he admitted that he had made false stories against money.
"In this case, I have noise in Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he stated on the public television network.
I did it primarily because I cooked after money and collection.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's excuses, New Express made his excuses on the first page, writeing that he did not correctly verify his articles.
Several important suspicions have recently made television beauty.
The experts say that people are systematicly restricted to make their grandfathers, despite a change in the law which has been voted before in the year prohibiting the authorities to force anybody to do itself.
The airport Charles-de-Gaulle in "incapacity"
In Toulon, the airport is in line.
The radioactive vapor flight detected on one of the two nuclear chauffings of Charles-de-Gaulle, mid-October, and when the ship was in the sea, was "no danger for the sea", but it is no consequence for the Marine.
The Royale has actually confirmed the "incapacity" of the ship until "the middle November", "the time to take the correct measures imposing" on the reacter.
On its hand, the DCNS company, a specialist of the Defence Boat, ensures that its teams and Arevas, moved in the Var for the occasion, "income on the airports currently".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pomp on the disadvantaged chauffure.
"All is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its deployment scheduled at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the National Marine to assure that "the ship's ship's activity programme" is not a nuclear propulsion.
Let us note that Charles-de-Gaulle's airport comes from a six-month period of interim maintenance.
He had appared from Toulon in mid October for a train.
This is, in particular, in order to qualify young chasing drivers.
A "small avarian", circled in the area of the reacter's confinement, was then produced on the amiral ship of the French float.
According to the National Marine, the equipment was not exposed to any radioactive contamination.
Since more than one year, I am even to find a strongly misleading of the people I meet: a monstrous evaluation of their properties, tax flow, all types of allowances, administrative costs to be completed.
Shortly, siphonage without limit of our pockets.
Millions of dilapided dollars could be sparged to allow a very respectful taxation of those paying.
Every silver removed from force to contributors reduces their consumption freedom and contributes to their appreciation.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major enterprises, it is not concerned about the sumptuary expenditures and the maintenance of boot canards: deficiency cultural centre, strong subvention to the Energy City, etc.
If these installations are not rentable, they will be sold to the private company or demolitated.
It is also anxious to find out the exhaustion of several properties in order to receive a major industry that has never come.
However, I give a honourable reference to the transformation of ancient Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but what cost for tax payers?
This is not the public pallars to invest in such companies, but also the private sector based on the application of the consumer.
The citizens were happy to learn that the Lakes in the Passover and the Piles will continue to provide the city in potential water.
After all industries (great water consumers) and at the large decline of the population, the use of water was decreased everywhere in the territory.
Without saying to get it, the city will never miss water and the serious regulation about its use may be greatly adult.
In summary, it is very easy to do great things with the money of others.
I'd be worried to defend such a balance.
With a brutal debt of more than $200 million, this city is not even more able to buy a stuck without pass through a billion regulation.
We've been managed for more than 40 years by cravates with beautiful diplomas for most of us and I don't think a floor of sheep makes worse.
Discover a drug tunnel between the United States and the Mexico with its own iron road
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug traffic between the United States and Mexico, having its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The American authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on an equivalent length of nearly six long football areas, relates to ships near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area rejoices of undefinable transfers, which allows easily dissimulation of drug loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs were resourced by unexpectedly, the authorities declared.
The authorities took 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel covering, the Jewish dossiers.
Three men who, the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of marijuana and cocaine in order to sell.
They commit a prison penalty from 10 years to perpetuity prison if they are condemned.
In Nogales, Arōna, traficers explode from large subterranean dressing channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage covered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after marijuana collection in the center of Mexico in October, thus put a challenge for drug maps that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passenger of approximately 700 yards equipped from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two of San Diego.
The British police delivers an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police has now issued an extraction mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who repeated to the Equator's Ambassade in London and asked the political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "release opinion" against Australia for 40 years, asking her to present herself to a police committee, and that if he did not, it would be able to be arrested.
Assange could be extracted to Sweden according to sexual offences, after exemption of all possible ways under the British law after the Supreme Court has invalidated the call he interrupted against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
In order to allow Stockholm to transfer his transfer to the United States, he found refuge in the Ecuador Equator in London on 19 June, requesting that country of South America for the political asylum.
Scotland Yard “slipped an advice against a 40-year-old man who asked him to present himself to a police committee at the date and time of his choice,” said a portfolio.
It continues to prevent the conditions of its freedom.
Abbassade commented on the release of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears to be extracted from Sweden to the United States where it could be accused of spending, after having devoted more than 250 000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting secret information.
How the biometries have invaded our lives
Do you finish the passwords to tap to access your smartphone or pay your purchases?
American, French, or Japanese researchers predict us a future where we will be reconstituted by the phone and computer biometrical sensors.
Bernard Didier, Adjoint Director-General of Morpho , even believes that "the century will be biometrical".
Only biometry will ensure the identity of a person who performs transactions in a transnational and transnational universe as well as the Internet .
Organizations dedicated to the protection of private life confirm this commitment for biometric, but they are concerned.
Nothing in 2011 and in France, the National Commission of Information and Freedoms authorised 774 printing systems, the form of the hands or the main network in business, administrations, cantines...
"All people will soon be identified, anywhere or when," Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such a optimism, among each other, and pessimism, among others?
Biometry will be supported on new techniques, which will allow new services to be made to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometrical data are digital prints, hand-contorning and the neck of the powder or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its restrictions.
"For example, some people who work the beton have very deep fingers and their prints are unable," says Philippe Robin, the technical director of the identity area at Thales Communications & Security.
And collecting it as well as the verification of the vineyard network and the round of the hand provides a voluntary and specific gesture of people.
It is at the same time a security - it is not possible to catch these data - and an inconvenient: the procedure should sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
Thus, research has been conducted since twenty years on other approaches, such as face or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the precision of sensors and the calculation capacity of computers necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of the face ability has been multiplied for ten years in the past five years, calculating Cyrille Bataller, director of the Accenture R&D workshops in Europe.
With our aid, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have developed automatic border posts using face ability.
It is now possible to identify a face or iris in movement.
"Auourd' now, we are investigating the ability of the voice or the way to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, director of the Security Research in Intel Labs.
A single and unfailable marker, DNA also survive hopes and concerns.
"In the present state of knowledge, it can be considered as the last biometrical data," confirms Soèe Vulliet-Tavernier, study guide, innovation and prospective to the CNIL.
But the DNA analysis is still very long and very costly.
The NEC proposes to Judicial police services a value costing EUR 90,000 to analyze DNA tests on the place of crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometry are separated into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (assuring that the person is the person it prefers to be).
The identification related to the delivery of identity papers until now: it must be confronted with the biometrical elements (prints, photos, iris) with the information that the State has on all citizens already listed.
This allows us to make sure that someone doesn't try to use the identity of someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
Hence, NEC proposes VIP ability to enter a hotel or magazine.
"We recover the pictures of the monitor cameras and comparisons with the photos of the collections freely on the Internet," says Dany Nassif, loaded, at NEC France, of commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: Take a picture of a cedam that makes the cheue in a magazine, follow its progression by the face and calculate the time of waiting.
Authentication concerns accessures ( borders, protected locations, cantines...) or logicals (opening an engineer).
The presence control was recently made.
"A biometrical pointer avoids the phenomena of the friend that points for another," justifys Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
In addition, the authentication will also involve transactions, especially those performed from Internet connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to recover money to some distributors by introducing his card and putting his hand on a biometrical player: this gesture replaces the brown of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulem by the Natural Security Society in partnership with banks and teachers of the large distribution: when paying in magazine with his cart, the client does not tap its code, but puts his finger in a player scanning the vineyards.
The experimentation is intended for six months.
If it is concluded, biometric readers could soon come to French trademen.
Tracks to reassurance users
There are three ways to make the seduative biometric in the eyes of the great public.
The first is to explain that she can win time.
"If, thanks to the biometry, a client remains in 30 seconds of less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer custom services: In a few years a voice server can recognize your voice and offer you options to measure.
And, finally, reassure by putting forward the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"The digital prints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second basis: the correction between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly safe box, which blocks if we try to move it," Philippe Robin, of Thales.
However, it is impossible to know if these talks really convince users.
Specialists of private life protection continue to be concerned.
"The progress of the face-up, the multiplication of the monitoring cameras and the large number of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, makes me afraid of the worst: a generalized monitoring," said Andrew Patrick, the Commissioner for the protection of private life in Canada.
A 210 km/h running driver with a warm drink between the feet seemed to be infringed by an amanda of 1 000 £
A carrier seemed to be infringed by a 1 000 £ amendee for a round of 210 km/h with a warm drink between his feet.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, of Tiptree in Essex, was found by conducting Mercedes Benz on the A120 height of Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be brought between her feet.
In the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie admitted the infringement of conduct without the requirement and attention.
The seven points on its authorisation led to a 6-month license recovery.
Howie was also condemned to pay costs up to 90 £ and a surtax for a victim of 100 £.
A tax on foreign property owners to make London's bullshit
The Tresor temporarily encrypted the tax measure on capital gains but expected a final decision of Mr. Osborne, which, in the 2012 budget, introduced a timber right of 7 % for the properties costing more than 2 % and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties in the framework of a company instead of individually.
The timber right is already applied to the resident properties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents 708 M £ on the 2012/13 fiscal year, which exceeds the total amount of North Ireland, Galles country, Ecosse, North East, Northwest and Yorkshire region.
Mr. Cook stated: "When the timber law has been taken on the properties of great value and the introduction of the anti-evitative law in the matter, it is very difficult to ensure that high-valuable properties are subjected to the effects of the obsolete residence tax system."
“But this change could make foreign investors retaining the idea of buying properties in London or the current owners to sell," he said.
The prestigious carrier – 5 to 10% of the highest prices of the real estate market – in the promoted sector in the southwest of London, from Fulham in Wimbledon, increased by 11,8% in the past year.
The prices in the center of London show a regular growth of 5,6 per cent in the year but have been spent by a full "internal market", the southwest of the city, the north (7,4 per cent) and the east (6,5 per cent) with a rename, and Savil studies.
Scientists are coming to light the way the movement of a dog's kitchen is linked to his humor.
Several studies have shown that happy dogs have increased their wheat towards the right (of the dog's view), while the nervous dogs have moved it to the left.
But now the scientists say that dogs can detect these subtil differences and answer them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscient of the Trend University, said: "All know that, with man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in stimulations that wake up positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what he was with other species.
He said that as in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for moving to the left and versa, and that both hemisphers played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs' disordered cheese movements, researchers followed animals watching films where other dogs were.
They measured the heart frequency of animals and analysed their behavior.
It will certainly not be necessary for long before we understand why their cheue is sometimes going on the one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We have presented to dogs of the films where other dogs contained – whether a natural version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor – and we could treat the movement of the cow and present it as going more to the left or right. ”
When animals have seen a dog without expression to remorse the cheue to the right (with the view of the dog that removes the cheue), they have remained perfectly defects.
But when they reveal a cheue mainly to the left (return once from the dog's viewpoint, their heart frequency was accelerated and they had anxious air.
Professor Vallortigara said that he didn't think the dogs were deliberately among them through these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not be concerned.
He said: “If you meet several times of other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their kids to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side brings a less friendly attitude, you will respond according to this experience. ”
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and farmers to better learn their animal emotions.
John Bradshaw, professor in conduct of Canin, invited to the Bristol University Veterinary Science School, indicated that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right at the canine species.
Last year, a team of the University of Lincoln discovered that the dogs were turning the head to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “The dogs went easier to a robot dog when his cheue moved to the left instead of to the right, rather than to become anxious – the inverse of what is in the Italian study. ”
He indicated that the differences to come from the fact that dogs who participated in different studies did not consider entirely the animals of the films or the dogs of robots as dogs.
A study on how dogs respond to true dogs could be useful, explained.
"Although many elements, recorded in different mammifers, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details must still be defined – and dogs do not make exception," he said.
However, because of the facility with which their behavior can be stored, it will certainly not be necessary for long before we understand why they move sometimes on the other side and sometimes.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert to Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease
The rock Group Arctic Monkeys reported a concert to Glasgow after a laryngite was given to his song.
The Sheffield group had to be held on Thursday in the Concert Room The Hydro in the city center.
However, the laryngite forced the song Alex Turner to reprogram the spectacle.
The announcement was made after the group was committed to report the same concert to the LG Arena de Birmingham Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Soon the decision to report the concert to the LG Arena de Birmingham tonight and after requesting a medical opinion, the Arctic Monkeys must also report the spectacle to the Hydro de Glasgow on Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laringite and regrets not to be able to happen in concert."
The LG Arena of Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the Glasgow Hydro will be held on 21 November.
All cards remain valid for these concerts.
We want to apologize to all the bankholders for all the disagreement caused.
Thank you for contacting the client service at the billet where you bought your billets for any additional help.
Pope François will name his first cardinals in February
Pope François will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, announced the Vatican Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest church men in the Catholic Church behind the paper, and those who elect it, so Frances will name his first group of men who will finally choose his follower.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, since a cardinal reaches the age of 80, it can no longer participate in the choice of a paper – so it returns to a group of 120 "electors".
In a new statement, the Federico Lombardi father, a Vatican portfolio, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremonie during which evics will be highlighted to the dignity of cardinal, known under the name of consistency.
"Pap François decided to make his decision to call the consortium of fev · in progress to facilitate the planning of other meetings needing the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero des Catholic Voices stated that from here, the number of electors will probably have decreased.
He stated that a papa generally named so many cardinals that it needed to reach 120 cartridges and so many cardinals of more than 80 years that he wanted.
The consistency of the next year will be important because it will be the first from the election of Dad François in March this year, said Valero.
For this time, there is a kind of tendency to privilege Europe, in particular Italy.
“ It will be interesting in seeing whether the new dad will name cardinals of the rest of the world to restore the balance, ” he said.
40% of the Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François has formulated the cardinal advice, a group of eight cardinals in the whole world loaded to examine the ways to reform the church.
Earlier, the dad decided to be alone.
“François now has chosen these eight cardinals to help them, ” explained Valero.
He claimed that he was "in fact possible" that Francois requested advice to the cardinals.
But we have never known such a situation – it's totally new.
Valero pointed out that the papers are generally representatives of large communities in the cardinal range, but that François was “full of surprises – so we don't know who he will name. ”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seats
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19 000 of its new pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to resolve a problem with the handful documents, a Friday statement of the American Property loaded by the vehicle safety regulation.
On some pickups, seats before presenting a defect at the level of inclination mechanism.
The documents therefore do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards relating to heads.
“If the vehicle is overtaken by the back, the heading may not protect the passengers correctly, thus increase the risk of hurt,” the statement shown on the National Highway Traffic Safety Handshot (NHTSA).
Remindered models were built between 1st to 10 September.
The spread of GM pickups began in June and represented the most important launch of vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its failure and revoltation in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first fifteenth October.
NHTSA could not examine the information letter to the owners due to the detention of 16 days of government activities, which has rarely increased vehicle gains in October.
The Pickups of Silverado and Sierra, which were restored for the 2014 model, increased by about 20 % during the first 10 months of the year, GM said.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickups Silverado and 16 503 pickups Sierra.
The course of GM's actions was 1.4% to reach $37.47 at New York's Friday after midnight.
A worker dies under beton blocks
A worker of the building was buried under tens of beton blocks, Thursday earlier, in Montreal.
The drama occurred at 11 hours, on Marquette Street, near the Beaubien street intersection, in the arrondment of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to the most likely, travels made on the foundations were running to this place for a certain time.
A mitoyen foundation wall had been raised in the last days.
It happened at the time the victim was coming on the song to recover its tools.
I passed in the car and saw the wall rolling with a big smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who stays near the song.
I was buried and I went to remove the big bricks that would cover him.
We've seen only a part of his leg, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an age in the fifty-year-old man who worked for a confusion company.
Reanimation manuals have been tried by emergency services, but without success.
The man hasn't survived his serious wounds.
An inspector of the Committee on Health and Work Safety has been moved on the places to ask about the circumstances around this drama.
The cry for an Obama elector's disappointment
I voted two times for President Obama, believeing in the possibility of a change
He says that Obama has made praiseful efforts enjoyed by the obstructionnism of the Republican Party
Obamacare site's difficulties or drones attacks are not excused by obstructionnism
The memory of the 2008 campaign of Obama is a trist memory of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying in the second year of doctor at the Harvard Medical Faculty.
I'm reading a deeply trist book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morocy of the 2th year of the doctor and repeat me of the hope.
It is called The Audacity to Win and is the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
When I ended the medical accounts of my patients tonight and I slept, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and talks to cut your suffle.
The election was completed by an exciting victory and the presentators of the newspapers took time to think about the historical nature of the time.
My friends wept with joy and my parents kept all the journals they found.
A young visionary team was going to the Maison-Blanche and the nation was ready to change.
In 2008, the transition period of Obama was 82% of favourable opinions.
And then I'll close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult wake, it's like a dream.
It is difficult to remember these full days of optimism, which are like a long memory, a grievous reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change has actually occurred in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That was nothing to see with what I imagined.
I put the credit of Obama of great achievements, since the Affordable Care Act (law on the border care) to our army Iraq, by the end of the "night seen nor known" and Oussama Ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to promote our nation in the field of reforms of immigration, public health care and closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after I have been able to defend Obama's administration against my couples and my mates, I can't give any further explanations.
I am at the border of the political disappointment.
The obstruction of the Republic cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the Private Life of Americans or the implementation of the denominators that reveal the government's mistakes.
It cannot justify Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without proceedings, or the exemption of public funds and the expenditure allowed during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that the efforts of the Blue House to reduce silence media are "the most aggressive... since Nixon's administration".
And, more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibleity of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Law on the Affordable Care Act has been executed.
I don't know if that's what I was doing.
If, at 18 years, I was supposed to understand that government could oppose the political campaigns that were before it.
Of course, the electoral function is not pre-second, because the political party of opposition and the events that occur by hazard, such as the massacre of Newton, affects our conversation.
However, all of the examples I have recorded above are largely the choice of the administration.
That's what's most hurt me.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiased by his candidate.
Mitt Romney had an alternative confused and unrefined that seemed not to be allowed to determine its policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, chosen for a second mandate by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that we had heard for so long.
However, while favorable opinions have been under 45 per cent this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have been involved.
This week, I read the part of the book that described how Obama had lost great losses from Clinton to Pennsylvania's Primaries.
At a post-campagne meeting, he told his team that they needed to stay on the right path and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to renew our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr President, and I do not agree with you anymore.
The viewpoints expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Thursday, at 15 hours, a violent existence between a motor and a car occurred in the street from Retinin to Fléron.
The motor, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fléron, did not carry a cask.
Despite the rapid intervention of losses, it was decided during this frontier.
Clive Palmer predicted that Mr Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental conge system.
Mr Clive Palmer states that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental conge system because his daughters could be disappointed and benefited from this system.
The size of the miner extraction, which contests the payment of a coal tax of a amount of 6 M$, has assessed this argument to try to separate the issues of a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four voices in the Senate, which could be crucial when decide whether carbon and mine taxes should be deleted.
But Mr Palmer stated that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's girls were ready to benefit personally from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when he will pay the parental congé because if one of his girls is deceived, he will have a direct interest in the fact that it gets or not a conge," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after its election, the Electoral Committee officially stated that Mr. Palmer received the Sunshine Coast de Fairfax seat by 53 votes after computing.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of a repair of the suffocation system to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote has been completed?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why couldn't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in an employer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper crawns to mark voting bulletins.
Is that the result if someone doesn't agree?
Today, have a extraordinary paper crawn.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possible options for the electronic vote and has recently made a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, stated that his political project included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he would take its new functions very seriously.
The exercise of functions is a question of public service.
"We are not looking for resistance, except the story's repee, because we have to serve the community at a critical moment," he said.
A team of biologists managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of dauphin boss at the northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, charged by scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Milieux Marins (OCEAMM) returns to the Express on this cover and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Do you surprise the decover of this new kind of dauphin to boss?
It's a good news, but it's not very surprising me.
In the past, the species have been described and identified on the basis of morphological, anatomic and geographical, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of species.
Moreover, these progress in genetic and molecular biological developments are not possible to reduce the classification or apparence of a species of a gene, a family, even a order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are made in question due to genetic progress.
Similarly, two very close genetic species were distinguished by genetic.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decree of years ago, the scientific community had two species belonging to this subfamily: the dauphins of the box of the chair and the boxes of the Atlantic.
Recent analyses have been allowed to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important coverage as said by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a view of conservation, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and its genetic variability.
If this population was already known by researchers for a long time, they don't know that it was a part of a new species, it's only here.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture is placed in the region, we could have an issue of extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more difficult.
A species is considered threatened or in the way of extinction in accordance with the number of existing individuals on Earth, namely the stock, and the possibility to restore from neighborhood stocks.
For the species Subsa Chinensis, whose population of the new covered species is issued, its stock has automatically become lower, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammifers?
The marine mammifers are set up above the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals.
This brassage of genes limits the creation of new species.
In contrast, the most closed ecosemes promote genetic isolation, which can result in the creation of new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least known environment.
It is preferred to send robots on Mars, but to know what is living in the Marian's sea, just 11 miles from the surface of the sea.
More money are spent in life research on other planets than in marine research, and it is great time to change.
RBS suspends two trades on the market of changes
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders of its market market division of changes; two sources close to the document, which shows that the world rulers' application on the suspicions of the market of the devises begins to bring its fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the world's most important financial market investigations, where 5,3 billion dollars change each day.
The two traders are the first employees of the RBS to be suspended in the context of the extension of the application that has failed to scandale the interbancation of Libor interbancar rate.
The bank, who has made comments on the suspension, confirmed that this month has received information requests from the regulators.
"The current question on this matter continues and we will cooperate fullly with the FCA and the other regulators," said a representative of the bank for two weeks ago.
Last month, nearly sources of the document stated that RBS had transmitted instantiated mail and mail documents, sent to and by an old trade, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trade, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from its European trade responsibility post to the JPMorgan account.
Rohan Ramchandani, European accounting trading responsibility in Citi, was put in conjunction this week, while Matt Gardiner, the senior transfer of devises at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been subject to any responsibility.
Mr. Usher's document included instantious messages sent to and by bans working at Barclays and Citigroup, which had close sources of the document.
UBS explained this week that she had intended to act against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that he asked about market manipulation suspicions in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swedish competition authority Weko, the FCA, the United States Justice Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – examine the claims made on banks that would be heard to manipulate the change market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Swiss credit have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from regulators, indicated close sources of the document.
The banks have exposed instantious messages and emails sent for years to find cases of repeated acts.
The news on these investigations has spread traders in a sector which was one of the largest growth engines of the trade units of the investment banks in recent years, but which has been revoked in this year because of the low volatility of devises that limit the opportunities for speculators.
Some banks have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large market of strongly liquid changes, but the elderly traders explain that it is not necessarily true.
An older trade stated that despite the high volume of daily change transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trade management platforms and the use of more frequently by the banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the short-cost market".
The news came on the same day when the Swiss credit announced that he had sent a trade in his business office for the debated funds in London this week after he had caused a loss of $6 in the last year.
The bank has rapidly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trade has acted alone and that the case has been managed," said a representative of the Swiss credit.
The question of Mr. Rob Ford has been bacled, supports a lawyer
After the police confirmed that he had put his hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Meemyton Ruby had never seen a "so badly" question.
Ruby told me to believe in the Canadian Presse that the police had "ignored or minimised" the evidence elements against the Mayor.
This Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's friend and opportunal driver, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extortion about the video.
Alexander Lisi, accused of drug traffic, was often contacted with the maire.
The police also said he had observed this man who delivered the balls in Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Ruby qualified me of "inexplainable" the fact that the police had never fought the Rob Ford vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, supporting that the police leader Bill Blair had chosen in knowledge of the cause of not acting against the maire.
According to the law, the police, who had been witness to suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, stop the maire, and make a prosecution - even without mandate.
It could also request an instantious prosecution mandate, if necessary.
The police leader did not comment, but Mark Pugash has qualified Me Ruby's proposals of "proofful and desperate temptation" to take place with media in a case that doesn't matter anyway.
In press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "realistic motives" that could lead to the depth of a ≥success against the master.
European Bourses below at the mid-session, except London
Except Londres, the main European Bourses develop at mid-session low on Thursday, broadcasts by some news of deceasing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to grow.
Furthermore, investors remain income because they believe that the American Federal Reserve could reduce its quantitative sustainment policy as soon as provided.
Instead, after the announcement of an inflation of 0.7% for the euro area, the idea is extended among the market operators that the European Central Bank (ECB) could double its monetary policy.
Wall Street's futures are allowed to open up American action after two consequent reply sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest response of CAC 40, which was made by the warning of his partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after it has also made the results in the decrease this morning and announced the creation inside of a ban banquet structure which includes 38 billion most risked activity books.
From its side, Vodafone (+2,45%) remains at the head of EuroFirst300's increases in response to pressing information that AT&T will study an eventual OPA.
On the market of changes, the specifications on the development of the monetary policy of the ECB are well trained, such as John Hardy, strategy at Saxo Bank.
The unique mandate of the ECB has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and her team have more reasons to act at the meeting of the next week.
We preach a potential low rate of the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to reply against the American currency and has touched one more than two weeks to $1,3517.
These same conjectures support the obligation market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court valids the Reform Act of Obama Health System
Great victory for the administration of Obama: The US Supreme Court today stated that the Reform Act of the Health System of Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (law on the protection of sickness and sustainable care) – which requires citizens to subscribe a health insurance from 2014, in order to pay an amendment – and said that it was constitutive in accordance with the government's imposing power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, rejected the four most liberal members of the Court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disappointment.
The Court also validated the other sections of 2 700 pages of the Act and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Law, which claims that the level of eligibility in Medicaid should be reduced in order to lose all federal funds of the programme, was coercitive to the constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was committed by 26 States and the National Federation of Indonesia Business.
All the biggest public candidates at the presidential election in school during the 2012 primary, including Mitt Romney's designed candidate, were very contrary to the law.
Vibrant homage made to the elderly fighters in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cimetary, civil authorities, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotics, they have made, on Friday after midnight, a threat to soldiers and losers of all wars.
The Master Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities have been deposited in two of the three military quarters of the cimetary.
Accroching between Palestinian and Israel at Gaza's border
Four warriors of Hamas were killed and five Israeli soldiers were wounded on Thursday 31 October 2013 at night during a violent croching at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only electrical central of the Gaza band stopped working on Friday 1 November after the exhaust of its fuel stocks, the Palestinian Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Brigades E日dine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another frame of the Army of Hamas, Rabieh Barikeh, was killed by a car-bowling in the east of the Israelite army Khan Younès, in the south of the Gaza band, and from local medical sources.
Two other local Brigades Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud found death when a Israeli helicopter opened the fire in the same region.
Their body has been covered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four warriors conducted a supervisory operation in the border area between the Palestinian clave and Israel.
A attack against a tunnel crushed by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, a Israelian car and a blind bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred centimetres inside the territory before they returned.
The confrontation was a half-hour, witnesses.
A Hamas portfolio, Sami Abou Zouhri, made the four "heroes" hunger and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas welcomes Al-Qassam's heroes who fell in defense in the territory at the incursion of the sionist occupant in Khan Younès.
Many enemies were killed and hurt during the operation.
"The Hamas assured that Gaza will be a fire for the employer," threatened the password.
On his side, the Israeli army pointed out that the objective of its operation was a section of a wide tunnel in Israel's territory from the Palestinian clave, covered on 7 October and intended to "the terrorist activities".
Hamas repeated the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, indicating that the purpose was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained a Israeli military military.
During the operation, Hamas deployed an explosive engine with regard to the forces of Tsahal (Israean army) and hurt five soldiers.
Israeli attack in the north of the Year
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," he also indicated the portfolio of the army Peter Lerner.
Moreover, Israel struck a air military base in the northwest of the Arabia, regarding a loading of missiles intended for the Lebanese closed movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday 31 October the Al-Arabiya satellitary chain.
A American responsibility confirmed a "Israelian flag" but did not provide any detail on the target.
"For the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he felt happy to be.
The Israeli Government's responsibles have confirmed any information on such an attack.
Citizens of the "sources" which she did not be named, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "bombarding intended to carry air mixtures for Hezbollah in Libanon", as regards the powerful Libanian chit movement that fights the rebellion at the side of Syrian forces.
In the past, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had made a number of divorced explosions in a air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian coast.
This organization supported a network of military and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of explosions.
Return black and white for Marie Chouinard, which presents her two new group coregraphies in Dance: the first inspired increases and poems of Henri Michaux, the second insufficient by Satie's Gymnopedia piano soles.
A night that allows you to see all the prize of Chouinard, art to tissues and black to white.
A white rubber served by background wall.
On the tapis, as white, in the large space that is the Theâtre Maisoneuve, is in progress, profile, end like a line and black clothing, a body.
On the Iran, the Enri Michaux' encree is designed.
The body, simply treat, takes its form.
And this form will be the one of the whole room: an infiltration of drawings of drawings.
Dancers, entirely dressed of black, only the hands and the covered face, wait on each side of the game air, predict when the next graph appears, incarn the incarnation, appear to be covering.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in sole reliefs, as a group of unions (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve soles where each exempts his sign.
The "Gloire of the morning", where Chouinard, on earth, performed a series of coregraphic tasks written on cards, placed on the front-scan.
This is the same principle, the PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, procurements and electric guitars.
Energy is high, the rythme is always quick.
There will be a cassure when Carol Prayer will reserve himself under the dance pipe, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriness or holding, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monoton in the cry, and will continue to dance.
And the music to share, and the sequence to recover.
This sound and energy decharge, long, if possible, ends by assuring and sharing.
As it also makes the regularity of the visual rythme.
There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - such as those hairs that swallow up or these black tissues that extend the lines.
But the coregraphic approach is missing composition.
We have the impression that the coregraph, instead of going to Michaux' work meeting, was impressed with its tissues.
Results: Bodies are placed in front of drawings.
Michaux' encres, like Gestalt's forms, open a wide and giboyous imaginary than the dance, more poor.
Only the end, negatively, with its dancers heated by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a black theater suddenly touched magic.
The public loved, the house was calm.
The Gymnopedies, after the entry, are richer.
The scene is part of gris flag, dancers and a plan are covered of tissues, like mobiles in a quiet house.
At the plan, dancers are relaxed to play partitions.
Their mistake in music, touching, give real fragility.
On scene, couples pass, in loved two, very sensitive, even erotic.
Group work, small transition sockets, in movements, hearts, writers are less binary.
Bouffons appear, also family members of Chouinard, treating the red nose, in very polyarised men-femish parades.
Love is carnassiers, fugitives or players.
The gesture, the laughs and the small crises are fully translating the archaic, grace and ridicule of the coat bodies, beings that are based.
But the room takes his real clothes after the salvation.
A clown comes back to scen when the public leaves.
There, all are allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes are superposed, the dancers caboting, descend among the spectators, gloom, smoke, short-circle, play applause codes, stretch the sauce into a self-recognised disaster that remains sensible.
Happiness and foolishness are transpired, and this is the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of Jewish prosecutions regarding North Patents
The group with thousands of northern patents of ancient Nortel started an avalanch of Jewish patents on July against transportable phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he covered in the pool during the sale of patents who had occurred after Nortel's failure.
Rockstar, the consortium who bought the Northern patents for $4.5 Md, claimed against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other patent violation companies before the United States Assedies Court in Texas.
Rockstar is joined by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patterns.
Patents contain ́s that allow to show a publicity related to Internet research terms, indicated the conclusions of the process, which is Google's medium heart.
It was not possible to join Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar representatives.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work under the Google Android exploitation system, which provides a fair competition to the Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 for Nortel patents.
Google has increased his offer in several times, to finally offer $4.4 Md$.
Following the loss of Nortel patents face Rockstar, Google gained Motorola Mobility for a amount of 12,5 Md$, a part market based on Motorola patent library.
“Although it has failed to purchase the patents concerned during businesses, Google has violated and continued to violate these patents, ” stated the conclusions of the procedure.
Rockstar calls on damage and interests more important against Google, because it predicts that the violation of Google patents is obstinated, and the plague.
Explosion of a house-in-law: a defective water carrier from the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have cut a cigarette on a gas fucking.
The explosion of a living room, which made two serious wounds morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and his five-year-old grandmother, is due to a defective gas fleet from a defective water chain, indicated the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert in place by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother stuck a cigarette while there was a fucking and gas accumulation.
The vital pronostic of both victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was designed by the explosion and is grievously burned.
The little boy, who lived with his grandfather and his companion, was at his side and was burned more furnished.
"The two victims were intubated and long-conditioned on the place before they were brought to the CHU of Liege, it was in helicopter, in ambulance," explained the bourgmester José Paulet, descending on the places.

Egypt requests the first president who is freely chosen to make prompt
Mohamed Morsi has made the commitment of investment, but it is little that his triomph day marks the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergency of a "new Egypt" when he prepared the commitment of investment to the presidentship, thus became the first president who was freely chosen and successful in Hosni Moubarak, who was expelled from the power of 16 months ago.
During his investment before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first islamist president who was freely chosen from the Arab world and the fifth head of Egypt state since the reverse of the monarch 60 years ago.
He made a swear before the 18 judges in black robe of the Court, whose building in the border of the Nil was built to resort to a Egyptian temple.
“ We are focusing on the best day, a new Egypt and a second Republic, ” said President Morsi during the solar ceremonie directly distributed on television.
“ Today, the Egyptian people have found the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability, ” explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer formed in the United States, from the Muslim Brothers, a group considered more than 84 years since his training as an illegal and sustainable organization of the successful governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were keeping the bathroom when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed a small convoi.
Only a few hundred centuries of supporters were gathered before the Court to claim the new president and, as a result of the early presidential of the years of Moubarak, the holding was only briefly interrupted to allow the transition of his convoi in the very frequent streets associated with the city centre to the southern villages.
Considered as the "scarismatic royal" of the Muslim Brothers, his staff was considered strengthened since its victory and his Friday talk during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all who want to complete the work started at the upload of 2011 against the responsibility president Moubarak.
"The Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red coast, addressing the judges presented in the orned beer room where he made a swear.
Later, Mr. Morsi came to the University of the Cairo, where he spoke his investment talk.
He was officially accompanied by a military fanfare who played the national hymne while he was at your guard.
The Hussein Tantaoui sea attended the ceremonie.
At his arrival, he was accompanied by the song “The people and the army, the hand in his hand...” insane by thousands of people gathered in the large amphithaist of the University.
Based in 1908 and ancient basation of the Laic Education, the University of Caire became a fifth of the islamist groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic promise on Friday on the Tahrir place, from which the resurrected statement that ended the authorization of Moubarak last year, and sweared to recover the presidential powers of the military Council, which replaced the former vice-president, deposed it.
However, by accepting officially asserted to the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is useful, he draws to the will of the army by showing that the fight for power is not completed.
Mr. Morsi's talk on the Tahrir place was associated with spectacular popular gestures.

Schools are encouraged to learn more about matematics, spelling and grammary
In the framework of the English literature courses, the → will have to study at least one part of Shakespeare, a romantic poem of the 19th century, and a modern British fiction work of 1914 in our day.
The examination will also present newx texts to encourage a more diversified reading.

The Ministry of Education must make its new programmes of → and maths tomorrow – the first materials to take up a radical review.
It will make changes in other materials in the next year.
Furthermore, Ofqual, the Office of the Controller of Assessments, will develop a refund of the GCSE structure, with a new notation system and less courses.

Studies show that schools have less time for mats (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer in a middle of 143 hours per year, and the Singapores are about 138 hours.

The ex captain of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cimeter
Mèmer, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his track, was actually buried in a common forum of a Berlin Jewish cimetary, states the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor John Tuchel, in Bild.
Memmer did not survive at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common forum of the Jewish cymetry of Berlin-Mitte," he assured the day of great-treatment by pressing on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the major engines of the Adel-Guerre.
The German secret services, the BND, also ensured that during the age of 1949, M. Vary was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, a document received by Image.
Secret services were totally missing.
"From 1945, the body of Mâmer was found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the Aviation of the Reich by a command," ­ Mr. Tuchel.
He brought "a general uniform."
"In the left internal pocket, it was particularly his service states with a photo," he continued.
Image also provides a document of the Middle Circle's Middle to Berlin, indicating that it was buried in the Jewish Center of the Quarter.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, has been shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal nazi sads is buried in a Jewish cimetric, it's an enormity of bad go.
"There is a great multitude of victims' memory from the foot," he insurged in the journal.
Heinrich Mämer is part of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided of the "final resolution" and was in particular under its orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and exemplary in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroun villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team pass almost all the weekends to see hundreds of patients
There are no many doctors in this Western African country, at least one for five thousand people.
Voice here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heros in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the exhibit “Heros CNN of the year”.
This person will receive $20,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
During 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father to change the periods of conscience and inconsciousness and to get into hospitals that were not equipped to come to him.
Jamef Bwelle was hurt in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroun.
At the beginning, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread up to his brain, creating a hematoome that he would have taken the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurochirurgians in Cameroun, ” Georges Bwelle said.
We would have brought him to the foreign if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle has spent years to accompany his father in clinics and hospitals, so that he can obtain any treatment he could benefit.
"It's not easy," Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 hours, go to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can do because they're waiting too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwell's father's death in 2002.
In Cameroun there are only one doctor for 5 000 people, the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Camerounians could not pay the consultation.
Two persons in five in the country live under poverty level, and nearly three quarters of the country's health expenditure are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After seeing his father and so much of his companions suffered, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have practiced more than 700 chirurgical acts in the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular chirurgian at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a humanitarian non-governmental, ASCOVIME, which is in rural areas for the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost all vendes, with a thirty persons, they are trying to get in firelines after fixing the medical material on the tower and crossing difficult areas to get into the villages that are most needed to help.
The chance doesn't always follow them.
They had to move the vehicles in the morning to cross the rubbers or boot tracks.
But when they come, they are received in heroes: the community organizes a festival, song and dance and offers them the best available apartments.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his great smile and its degree of energy – is more happy to join the festivals.
On the next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“ We receive 500 people at each visit, ” Mr. Bwelle said.
Sometimes they live at 60 km from the village, and they come.
In this tinnering hospital, there are various health cares.
Many people receive treatment against paludism, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others can receive beaches, a couple of collected lunettes or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to the Âole, but many poor families can't just be able to buy it.
Last night, the practical team of simple chirurgical acts under local anesthesie.
The operations are generally practiced in a school, a mairi or a house; after intervention, the patient rises and comes into the awake room to leave its place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrogen group, the operational room and the sterilisation of the maternal, Dr. Bwelle and its benefits work until the first hours of the morning.
It's a fucking rite, but musicians in the villages are generally helping the team to remain motivated.
“ They strike over the tents all night to keep us wake up so that we can continue working, ” Mr. Bwelle explained.
On Monday, the team returns to town, fatigued but fiercely in the work she has done.
The group, composed of Cameroon doctors and doctors, has practiced 700 chirurgical acts freely during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the differences for those to whom they come to help.
A man explained that the free operation that he had taken to warn a hernie would allow him to work again.
“ This will change my future and my family, ” said the man.
In addition to living this tinnering hospital and working as chirurgian at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle works also night in private medical cabinets around Yaounde.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of its own; the rest is covered by private gifts.
"I don't know when he is sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of the Drexel University in Philadelité and welcomed in the Dr. Bwelle group.
He's still at the hospital or trying to find money for his own to be able to carry these campaigns.
For medical students and students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in its missions, it is a opportunity to learn about the area they do not have.
"We were able to participate in operations to help put blood on or send the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," Mrs. O'Malley explained.
It's not something you've got the opportunity to do in America when you're studying a doctor in second year.
Welcome students generally pay their journey to Cameroun, and often come with a collected medical material.
But once in Yaounde, their pension, their transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is not near to escape.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant work charge is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happy by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him a great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” Mr. Bwelle said.
And I think of my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
Making people ridiculous and losing pain is the reasons for me to do that.

The two France of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, universities have long been pleasing to define and hold Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphytheaters and course rooms?
No doubt, but by highlighting his weakness for the crossways, Sciences-Po, the High Studys.
Arbitre other works in his Gaston-Gallimard street office?
In fact, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writer of the editor.
Heritage of the fault that Fontenelle takes on the French Academy?
Certainly still, but knowing that such a sacrifice could not replace the true holy oil, the tess, which has passed.
They volunteerly recognized in him a big wake, animator and federalist of their travels, but noting that he would show himself a little close to produce itself.
In this uncertain image the monument of the "Memory Places", which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages could have seen a gigantic market at the puces, presented by a smart commentator, given a vif eye and late earudition, but dilettant incur.
The two works made by Nora here soon two years have already stated that the one who passed not to write had much and well written.
The book this should make him definitively justice.
However, once again, the temptation of obicity, the intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation started to slipped as a joint feet of one subject to another.
But it is quickly understanding that the disappeared objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title raise the brochure to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutional need of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to the national unit?
Property: It's a timely concern.
This is a little, we have been collectively invited to give it a definition.
But in the perpetual mind of our leaders at the time, the French identity was an intellectual importance.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, obliged jacobinism, was confidenced to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorised interprets.
The one who tracks Pierre Nora is everything else.
It is not inherited by a foreign franchiness, but by the definition.
Analysis anxious of a strangeness, he is wrong in a forest of symbols, arrested each step by an object in the form of rebus, tortured from irritant questions.
So this, which is born from the company itself: why, in a so hard country installed in its borders, if anciently charpent and solidly mad, are these dramatic calls to the unit?
They are not so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, but to conjugate the disorder of the French story discourses.
Francs and Gaulois, Armgnacs and Bourguignons, Catholic and Protestants: the division forces, here, are very old.
And the most emblamatic is obviously the one that finds the national history in two.
As regards the revolution seism, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without reaching the renal; in contrast, concernful to find the sacredness and much more aware of unity and invisibleness that she had cut the head to the one who was evident and powerful incarnation.
And thereafter, a invisible binary nation, divided between left and right, laicity and catholicism, worship and hate of revolution.
To make this uniqueness of the French identity, nothing worth the four steps outside Hexagone, even though the American escape of Pierre Nora might be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one and another a revolution, published a statement of rights, I wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cousinage just makes it better to highlight what we are clean.
There, men who had left their ancient Government in the territory and had no more concern.
Here, men covered by an ancient indigenous regime, and much more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when she seed the drama and confessed it.
There are always honored fundamental fathers, and here are revolutionary preachers who are deceived to make models, and who have remained involved.
There is a institutional constant, and here a case of constitutions, such as such errors to ratify and try again.
France who goes out, France who comes
However, there was a time when the French believed that they could cut off their story and win the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to prepare the revolutionary fracture, teaching to schoolers everything that was obscurely prepared in the ancient France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only a time.
This is again discussed by a new type of immigration, threatened by the assembly of revendicative minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book, therefore, offers the fascinating port of France that goes and the circonstance of France that comes.
Avec, firstly, would have the historical portrait, which should reserve some surprises.
There's found that the road was a wedding.
The man of multiple curiosities turned around the same idea.
The road of lisers was at the center of the center.
And he who had deposed, here is more than a half-year-old, a subject of the idea of the nation, but was subjected to the initial exercise of the tess, confided us, as grano salis, that he would be done by doing it.
Certificates in a less raid, lighter and more subtil.
But we don't miss it, it's so contrary.
For more than the figure of the university course, this teeth says the internal need for a life.
An old age in Liban: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Remoted in Beyrouth on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team came to film a manifestation of Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later on 27 November 1987.
Retrait since 2008, he participated in the creation of the Defense of World Otages, which he has been presided for several years.
Its main goal is that the possibility for the acquirement of complaints is to bring their charges before the International Criminal Court.
During more than 1.000 days, the four gates of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret were released on Monday.
After medical exames at the military hospital of Val-de-Grece Wednesday after midnight, they could, since then, find their families.
And trying, a little bit, to repeat the course of their life.
"The New Observator" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, ex large reporter, retraite since 2008, President of the World Otages."
Since the night of your release, you were on the 20th "Antenna 2" plate.
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beyrouth.
When I'm released, I find me in the coffee of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it makes black - Roger Auque.
He said, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he says that we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tend too.
It's war, and those who lead us are also very tend.
They put us on the border of a trottoir.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive on the hotel of Summerland where the press is present.
French lead us to France's ambassade.
It's time for parents, family, friends, press...
I remember taking a bathroom for a hour.
And I've been dinnering at France's ambassade.
I also remember a short night to talk with Roger and Marchiani.
The pressure is still here because we have no means to evacuate us to the Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
We are taking a private aircraft that leads us to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pascua embarque.
How did your arrival go on the French ground?
We're attached to Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible boss.
And many media.
When I left there were three television chains.
I'm back and it's full of it.
The decline of the plane scale, the findings with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Among the airport and me, many motors follow our car that Roussin drives.
Motors shoot the bowl to make photos and follow me up to me where I have to do a little police to prevent some of the upcoming.
Medical pressure is great.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know that...
But the condition of emotion and weakness is as difficult to see it.
We're out of a shot and we're just under the median fires.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, enough complex to manage.
But we've done the hardest.
At the same night, I'm at 20:00, the next day I'm on the television.
Then starts a kind of readaptation to life, very doubly, for one or two months that are a little like vacations.
How did medical examinations and debribrising DGSE have been conducted?
I had the right to a first medical control in Corse.
The rest was made in Val-de-Grace the following days I returned: radios, reviews in all kinds and meet with a psychiater.
This is not a meeting that does all, but we know that we can count on him, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met information services.
They asked me some questions about the otage holders.
It was logical.
It didn't hurt me.
How do you respond today to the release of the four niger ottes?
I'm listening to what you say.
The debate on the ransoms, in particular.
Some things hurt me, others less.
I'm trying to make the part of the matters between my past issues as an otage and my chairman of the "World Otages", which allows me to put the distance, and I am much more interesting to go.
I, for example, ask me about the definition of resolution.
In particular, I fight, with others, for the legal status of the detention.
I have a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify the taking of "political payments" grants - which is most of the time - and to allow the gains to have access to justice, to make claims and to bring their charges before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the freedom of these gates.
But who says that these gates might also have access to justice?
A court in La Haye is done for this.
Why wouldn't we say to the hosts "you have baptized the rules of war, like those of all the conventions of Geneva, we will bring you to justice"?
However, it's founded, I've been deceived with good sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it's choosing me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to deny Morsi's proceedings
The wrath is in the ranges of Egyptian islamists.
Two days before the opening of the Chairman of Mohamed Morsi's proceedings, they came down in the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to claim the restoration of the first president, democracyly chosen country.
This is not a trial underlined by the military of the Muslim Brothers.
Until this time, no avocate could meet him and no volunteer could take a copy of the documents of the matter.
It's not a trial, it's a barce.
The procedure of President Morsi is a false proceeding, which is a pro-Morsi, which must be judged by Sisi, not the contrary.
Morsi must judge Sisi for Rabaa's massacres, Nada's massacres, and the massacres of the Republic Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
The police used lacrymogen gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed before the Caire Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel recalls 9 United States to violate homosexual rights
Since the Federal State has recognised homosexual marriage, "all soldiers have the right to a card of identity of the Department of Defense and the performances coming with," the Minister in New York reminded the Department of the Anti-Defamation League of Anti-Defamation.

A resident of Aubervilliers launchs its part of the campaign
We don't lie, especially.
In the mind of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieusards.
I chose a card from France as a logo, justify it.
When I talk about the battle, I address all those excluded from the large national family.
However, his project, presented on Thursday in a press conference in its home community of Aubervilliers, has been born of the will of better defense of the multiculturalism, this big melling cultural pot that characterizes before all quarters.
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, indicating it.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territory attached, returns today as "100% apolitic" even if he has not always been neutral.
In 2002, by the side of Jean-Pierre Chevenement, he then supported the Dominica de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I propose in my program are ratted on the left but if the right people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, if they continue.
There's only one of the extremists that I'm not talking.
In addition to the multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has made its program -consultable on the Internet - from many themes to speak to the people of banlieue, in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the abilityalisation of cannabis, the majority of 16 years of civility, the rehabilitation of the guardian function...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend its ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, it can be just, it recognises."
It's a problem of time and money.
The Country Party should be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidate, and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune has already seven list headers in France and Martinique.
"And the support mails I received since yesterday are not all out of banlieue" he rejoices.
