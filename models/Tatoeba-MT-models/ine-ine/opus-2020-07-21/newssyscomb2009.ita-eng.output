The trionph of the right peoples in Austria: in total they have 29%
The conscious inflammation of both existing parties in the large coalition and this marked strengthening of the peoples of the right parts has led, according to the first prospector results, to the previous parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian Popular Party (ÖVP), within which the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously cleaning, has immediately lost particularly strong.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the subprefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the trionphale return in the political policy.
According to the reporting results, the strongest party in the country remains the social-democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, however, compared to the last elections of 2006, but 5.5%.
It is still worse to ÖVP, which loses 25.6% of the votes.
There are the worst results of these two large parties in the Australian history of Dopoguerra, and especially the result of literally catastrophic of the people, which have caused previous elections.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP abandoned the coalition, the people had in the preferences before SPÖ a wonderful advantage.
But the electors have obviously punished them because they have made the government ahead.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations on the possibilities of the Chairman of the Party, the Wilhelm Monter Cancellier.
The observators believe that they may be able to occur on Monday during the extraordinary calling of the party's direction.
This evolution may be to facilitate the way to the most probably outcome from the electoral result, namely to the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both the people of the right and the liberal party (FPÖ), the BZÖ had previously gained the 18% and the 11% of votes - but the socio-democratics showed simultaneously the concern of another 1999, when the peoples agreed with the collective government (for now the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 he was separated from BZÖ) that was also reasonable for sanctions from the European Union.
About this evolution, obviously, Hader, who has already declared that it is ready to handle any party and assume a return to Vienna in the policy na.
In Parliament, it has also been able to enter the Green Party, which, however, has been lightly fallen, falling among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% surface and has not entered into Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be refrigerated
If you couldn't repeat the problem with the Czech scientists who were held in the illegal collection of Scarbai in India, it would be, according to the Czech foreign minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain refrigeration of the Czech-Indian reports.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after the today's meeting with his Indian Omolog Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it doesn't rise, then it would have a certain refrigeration," she found after the meeting that has happened under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after negotiations said that the executive power could hardly enter into the legal factors.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Svacha, who was appealed by ‘em and punished with a punk, the central government can negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling what is falling under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem may be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kuchera condemned to three years of prison, to return to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for freedom of care and wait for the judgment in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same way during negotiations.
"Recommend the replacement to the More Court then you will be able to get grace," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter into the fashion is to provide the "competent legal subsequence" to the consequences of the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such a support is already being provided by the Indian party.
"We have the most interest in maintaining the best relationships that have been spent for many years with India.
The Indians also admit it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as she said to CTK, before her partner, she stressed that the Czech Republic is important to the problem of Czech Entomologists.
"We really consider a deep error to reclaim and accusation of these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister has avoided answering the question if he has received the pro­ject to take care of the matter from the Indian party.
"I have received many promises," he just found.
A Czech Judge in the Lake for the Sea Funds
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is designed and the sea areas.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point in the ocean blue.
"The island belongs to the island and with her the marine baseline.
The area is at the same time large as the continent itself, says the Italian advocate Luigi Santosusso, which is part of a 33 worker team of the OSN Division for the issues of the ocean and maritime rights.
His boss, the Czech Director Director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, follows his exhibition and adds everything.
Does the desire to work and entusiasm.
The marine foundation is still hiding a little known world of natural resources.
It is possible to find the oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also living organisms that are not known until now carrying out the key for the detection of the medicine against cancer.
The largest foundation of the terraferm
The states have started to provide interest in the submarine territory.
According to the OSN Convention, the laws that have made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially the area of so-determined continental platform that often extends to hundreds of kilometres from the coast of the state concerned.
This has, according to the Convention, a exclusive right on all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for continental platforms, that part of marine foundation and its sub-ground is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The exclusive economic area is extended outside the territorial sea often more than 200 miles of nautives,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country is presented before the Committee for the definition of the dimensions of the continental platform should be accompanied by a very large technical documentation based on many costous investigations and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation for many years.
"On of our tasks is to seek the Commission a juridical and technical and professional.
The Committee has treated up to five requests of Russia, Brazil, Language, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominates have succeeded," added Mikulka.
The recent success of the ‘’’’ which has largely expanded its marine possessions has registered a global eco.
But also the New Zealand has gained us - the surface of the sea foundation, which has been signed by the Commission last week, of approximately 1,6 squared kilometers, so more or less than six times greater than the same state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The benefit, which will produce it in the future from the sea funds, as it is promised, will be unvaluable.
Other States will also gradually present their requests.
They can do so for ten years since it was "the Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental platform ends starts the area of the ocean fund that the Convention has declared a common inheritance of the 'humanity'."
There's no one who has a exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this internal institution established by the Convention.
"But the Sea Fund is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, "with the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their contractually established regime."
Czech in the Implementation
A part of the sea foundation belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If you disrupt it with other states of the former Soviet block in the scope of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This bought in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as the investors of some other states, the status of so-called "pionial investor".
He has the right to extract in the area of RionClipperton in the extent ocean between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area exploited by the investor and less larger than the ex Czechoslovakia.
The background is broadcast, it is a nearly submarine replica of Tatry.
"It can be stretched on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich polymetallic agglomerates containing ninele, ram, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian advocate Pakshi Rajan.
A worker of the division of Rober Sandev brings a record with you to show it.
It seems to be a little patate or with a little fantasy, a legendary scheme, like in the legend of the Golem's reveal.
German special units were presented to the release of obstacles
The Egyptian government had requested to Germany for the freedom of obstacles – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
In the circumstances of the liberation of 11 secure European barriers, we are always more detailed.
For salvation operation as mentioned by the Defence Minister and the Internal Ministry, you have participated in German special units.
In addition to the experts of the exercise, the GSG9 units were present, the Federal Federal Police, the federal criminal office, as well as the logistic experts of the technical institution.
As the portfolio of the ministers on Monday evening, the German units have not been intervened because the sequestrators, since the risk of a force intervention have released the refugee stops.
The Egyptian government accepted the a·a's offered by the Germans to join himself as direct assistance on the place.
"We haven't come for happiness," says a portfolio of the Ministry of the Internal Ministry.
The aggressors took a group of travelers in the south of Egypt on 19 September: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Roman as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the rape in a deserted area in South Egypt, the ships were deported into the border area between Egypt, Libya, South and Ciad.
The identity of the repairs until the end remains secret, as well as the details of the freedom or the possible remuneration payments.
The freedoms at the same time arrived in good conditions to Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the free barriers are under the protection of the German ambassador.
You haven't explained the details of the release.
There were no information in Berlin for when they would return to Germany.
According to the 5 holidays and special units, they should fly with an Airbus of the military aircraft and come on Thursday to Germany.
American representative room refuses the safeguard package.
The first room of the American Congress has failed to save 700 billion dollars for the financial sea.
Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 votes to 227 the American representative house refused the government's salvation package for the financial sea.
Despite the calls of the American President George W. Bush and the first-plan politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the Caos of the Financial Seas should be argued.
In a dramatic action, the supporters have tried distressfully to convince the critics from the wide packaging of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the treaties leaders, encouraged the lawyers to consensus, even though the plan was impopular.
8. It is difficult to have power to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the Dow Jones was in the passion, the Dow Jones was crossed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for the concerns of investors was that the State salvation package could fail.
The vote was repeated before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure announcement, it was revoked.
Experts are now expecting other serious turbulences on internal financial marine.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it is necessary to have the benefit of both the lawyers and the Senate's room.
Promotors register numbers increasing reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to a study, the facturation of travel reservations for the next months in comparison to the year’s year has been clearly increased - for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite the debole seemed to congi·la’s desire to travel Germans standing at an investigation remains sald.
At the winter season reservations, travel agencies have registered more than 31 % of the facturation compared to the same period of the year, as the German association for the DRV tourism reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, there are also increased booking quotas already for autonomous months.
Therefore, the excedence of travel agencies for October in comparison with 2007 would be about 11%, reported the DRV.
For these results, GfK's numbers are estimated, which each month analyses the recording data of 1200 German travel agencies and provides statistical projections for the whole market.
The travel reservations would also be made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak quotation of the dollar, particularly requested to travel to the United States, the DRV refers.
Here's the increase in reservations would lead to a third of them.
They would also be particularly requested at Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locality in Germany.
Especially the roads include a high quotation, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of increased energy and foods, in this case it would be better calculable for customers than for individually organized vaccination."
Consumers could spare money through, among others, reserved for high anticipation bookings or offered with all, Laepple explained.
Moreover, the extent months would have registered excellent booking numbers, as compared to the year before it would be registered a exception of the factured - even if, according to a further study, the number of Germans who have entered a travel, in comparison to the year, has fallen.
My first time at Octoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, beer of the mouths of a litre and vip in Dirndln arrested.
A Debutt al Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I have actually not much in common.
You're bionda, TV moderate and takes a Dirndl made on measure .
I have the dark hair, I'm student, and my clothes are in second hand.
One thing, however, comes to us: -- 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photos are already starting against us and scattering photos until they fill the memory of photos – very lighty, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends are doing.
The Dirndl of two money seems to reach his goal.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and resident in the north of the white salts equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/abite until today remains in the limits.
And however, once he arrived to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone brings the Dirndl or the skin bottles; no one looks disgusting or injured – everything is perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's grid collects strange looks at the station of the bananas at the chocolate.
A monastery notes me that I would have lacked the rubber in a wrong way: "Left you're free, in the middle of six virgins, at the right, you're imprisoned, behind the widow."
I'm surprisingly systeming my fuck back to left.
All right," he says and smiles.
Others do less slow of flirt technic softs and carry on the top of fibre capsules, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" and they will strike the naked distiller against a non-invited.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "ooooo".
This touchs me, after he was released from his beer mouth from a litre drinking before.
I just appreciate one of these hidrogens, whose everyone thinks it is a pattumary.
Bob is likely one of these "Wildbieslers".
Others don't have the happiness to get out of alcohol in this way.
Near the 8th evening they walk on the festival the sane, who must take care of the poor wells
The sisters do each time in ́equal – always 4 once take a tree of tent covered in the tent.
This works as with most of the Wiesn visitors: it's empty, it's back full.
Whoever lies under the telone in this alcohol rate bar in the blood, you don't see.
"Des are day, where goarnimmer packn," he urges me one of the san and goes into the baron.
Victory of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman died in hospital after being invested by a vehicle while he walked to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was coin in the evening Wednesday on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was brought to Queen's Hospital, to Romeford, but she died a little later.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the accusation of delegate leadership.
He was released on care.
Turkey is expanding the diplomatic horizontals
So much before Turkey was trying to enter the European Union, the European powers were concerned to deeply penetrate the Turkish hitherlands.
On the east side of Bosforo, perhaps 20 in Asia, there is one of the most beautiful residues of this fascinated imperial ambition.
The train station of Hydarpasha was designed by two German Otto Ritters and Helmut Conu neo-rinascimental style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building is at horses between the end of the platforms with a tour on each of its angles looking at the world as some German provincies.
The stone's crazy.
The whole building is very nice.
But once in the office of tickets from the suffit once, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardatory at the imperial, wanted to carry out its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was running to Baghdad, and in addition to that which is today the Saudi Arabia.
But the Imperial ambitions of Germany were deceived during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
The related isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the yellow borders of the cold war, has passed
British and dominant forces went out of Egypt and threw the Turks and their German covenants out of Palestinian and Syria.
And there were bad news too for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train of munitions struggled by destroying its designed teat.
Turkish sources say it's a sabotage.
Since then, he went quietly in disfashion, broad over the story.
But today, this railway shock for Anatolia and all the east points are needed - at least symbolically - to highlight the diplomatic horizontals always bigger than Turkey.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The related isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the yellow borders of the cold war, has passed.
Now there is a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has noteworthy relationships with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian fations of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To appreciate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I was shiping on the wagon bed for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main external experts of the AKP, the Turkish Deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - approximately ten hours and half after - after a course of subbalts on the tracks that produced the old world's passions of the documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a centuries intentioned to return the shoes to its Ottoman's past.
But the AKP with its well-known islamic roots represents an example of movement in the Turkish consciousness.
He suggested some suspects in the OÂe, more significantly in Washington.
A taxi brings me in the AKP general quarter, a ultra-modern structural of stone and steel - builded ad hoc - in a subbureau in development, surrounded by commercial centres of building and passports of power, where managing in full business - both men and women - are met to make contracts for the first morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu may be a center-right policy from almost every other European political party.
I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The objective of the external policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its neighbors.
The cold war was an anomalie," he says.
Turkey has been cut out of its land.
Today you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or another.
They must be both.
"But certainly at a certain point," I ask, "the Turkey will be willing to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "isn't wanting where to face that choice."
Then it highlights a point that almost all of those with whom I spoke here have recited in memory: the links of not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucaso, and all around to the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole Europe can metaphorically pass through those railway lines towards east through Asia and Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German Gentilums Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu who have watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that the middle-East ambitions of Europe can now be in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look at the terminal for the tragedy that brings me back through Bosnia, I remember that in those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
Then, at least, it seemed not to be doubtful about what continent would have to be worthy of this fascinating country.
Quickly remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, 11 September) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the crown.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the next year founded his wonderful young coro, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21/ under the 21 years, but at the time Proteus sang his end in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we refused to reject the crown.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutual) represented the good will of the coro and the ability to face everything that the music had to do, both madrigales and Messiaen, without companion or with the whole orchestra.
The musical veratility produced by such a young coro was often stupid, always citizen, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the entusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often it was told us by Tod to "leave that it's the music to talk for yourself."
He said, "He knows what he wants.
There's everything in music.
So sing it!"
His technology in the use of the chat was absolutely clear and precise, even though never dictatory or flowered.
Whatever it was the musical standard, he always made it higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you'd have to be assigned to an orchestra director, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades in which Guildford Philharmonic was conducted from 1962 to 1982.
In the past 40 years, I had more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been in concord with one of the only ones - and many times inspired by 日.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the orchestra directors who, in his words, "will run around the world one or two well known horses."
It'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett says:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (September 25) indicates that "in 1946 she reaped to study economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a science laury, one in letters and a PhD."
This results from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
Since 1946 to 1953, he was a student of economic history university at the University of Nottingham, in that period a PhD tess on the British Gomma industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published in 1958 as the British Ruber Industry.
He passed in 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the age of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he permanently left Nottingham for I日nois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his car, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino to the Faculty of Filology
"Recommended the show of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and life", because his photos in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have attached my attention to the simplicity and force they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
A demonstration that sends a lot of feelings.
Resino can catch magical moments."
Second accommodation for the overseers of Honda
In November, Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of Jazz model.
If the model has already been given great residence, this new monovolume has an even larger internal space.
To all, a raffined mechanical must be added, which increases the driving comfort and allows burning.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz extactly presents a very similar line to the model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth signaling a innovative design, a new platform, larger and new mechanical dimensions.
However, prior to analysis of the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the income on the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other sea, there remains a unique phenomena in the case of sales.
It is exactly the case of Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and even during this 2008.
Just in Japan were sold nearly a million Jazz units from the time of launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with approximately half million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase the sales in the segment.
Thus, if the Japanese company sold a total of 83.000 units of this model in 2007, the estimates would take about 100.000 vehicles, providing an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8.000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation, the Spanish branch office expects to sell around 2,000 Jazz units in the ark of a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda .di to decrease the hole of sales in Spain.
In fact, the enterprises are intended to reach at the end of the year with a total of 22.000 sold units, or 4.000, unless in 2007, with a 16% steel.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market quota in Spain, reaching 1,8%, before 1,6% of the last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To strengthen us, Honda trusts in the arrival of another model.
It is Insight, a hybrid at five gates and a compact format - 4,37 meters of length - which the Japanese company expects to sell about 200,000 units per year throughout the world.
For the sea and according to the estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is intended for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in company in January in Valencia.
In respect of the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
His length reaches 3.90 metres (fem meters in addition), the width at 1.69 metres (two meters in more) and the interaction between 2.50 metres, with a increase of five metres.
The height, however, remains at 1.52 metres.
In addition to increased dimensions, the inhabitable inner is also expanded.
This benefit results from one side from the insertion of a new platform, and from one side from the introduction of the fuel stock in central position, a solution also adopted in Jazz日e model.
Furthermore, the bathroom’s ability – double background dot - is 399 litres, or, 19 litres more the ability of the first generation.
It must be reported that these are the measures of the engine version 1.4 and that the ability of the pack of Honda Jazz ↓ is 379 litres.
Other improvements - besides external elements, such as the behind leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - are involved in improvement in the accessibility of the behind seats.
The doors that allow access to the poster positions are in fact opened with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Moreover, also motors in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of the marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with gas motors from 日 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanisms include the i-VTEC technology that can reduce consumption, produce less carbon biocide emissions, optimize the mechanism, and at the same time keeps the couple of the engine high in all its phases.
The litres model allows you to enjoy a power of 90 cv to 6.000 tours with a maximum couple of 114 Nm. to 4.900 tours.
The propulsion – which in Jazzi reached the 78 horses - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of approximately 125 grams.
In respect of the propulsion, that in the first generation model used 83 horses, they are now available to 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reach a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 em.
The "ape car" to avoid sessions
In the context of the development of the technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has been experienced this time, in nature, and in particular for the waters.
The Japanese company created a robot that, for example, takes the air flight, knows to avoid accidents.
It's the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, or the first to the prevention technology.
The Engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot with the research Centre for Scientific and Technology of the Prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Two, Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C has an extension of the Safety Score of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is able to improve the ability to prevent the seats in the vehicles of the manufacturer house.
Flight, every water creates a own personal oval form space that is very similar to Nissan security sculpture.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of the apps, able to see in all directions with an angle above 300 degrees, which allows the insect to flight without interruption in his personal space.
To restore this visual functionality, the engineers pointed out what they defined a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifys the obstacles that are located before BR23C for a radius within the two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance compared to the object and sends a signal to a board micro-emission that immediately prevents the employment.
"In the moment when he finds an obstacle, the small robot imitates the moves of an appeal and immediately changes direction by turning on the right or greater roads to avoid the eye.
The most evident difference with any assisted system is that the evasion manual is totally instinct.
"If it wasn't so, the robot would not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer head of this project.
In contrast to an appeal, the robot cannot move up or down, even in diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction where they can turn their wheels and not use infinite directions and ways as the waters do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, besides acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid the admissions.
"This device only needs to draw up information every few seconds, and to act from these data.
It does not require memory of information or intuitive logic of the previous manuals, so it can work without interruption and with only a few dozens of KB memory.
This can surprise, but we don't talk about gigabytes of memory, nor of mega."
It is the first approach to the development of new technologies for the instantious prevention of the sessions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be serious in cars within ten years.
The robot uses bacteria to litio polymers, which are more reading and harder than typology with litio ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to carry the destination driver by avoiding the obstacles presented in the path.
Trema before requesting a loan
D We must ensure that the Department of the United States Treasury, in addition to having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not an engine.
In the context of the crisis and to avoid the Americans committing their commitment with mutues in doubting banks, they have created a funny and instructive for the users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits" or problems.
The tetra look of this systemation and, in particular, his recipient needs to induce to think not one, but two or three times before you ask for a loan.
And, in particular, where to do this, that is probably the primary objective.
Of course, the information that provides is useful, but it is little detailed.
It's more than one page for adolescents than a site for the large public.
What happens if it is completed?
Well, it appears a dream room inside the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house doesn't even speak...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signature of an agreement with the UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a quota equal to 21% of participation in the Society, the news arrived after a net overseer of its actions in Borsa.
One week after the extent of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's individual cost of 25.25 dollars, or a sum of three billion dollars.
The fixed price is less than 19% of the accountable value of the licences than 31 August.
MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible licences to a conversion price of $31.25, guaranteeing a 10% income.
Morgan Stanley indicated that the global operation would be made on the basis of a average price of $29, or a percentage lower than its course of 28%.
At the 17th hour, however, Morgan Stanley's title was 6,79% to $23.07.
"This strategic covenant has an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley in bank holding company," explained John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statue last week, which should allow you to distinguish its actions by making it, however, under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its covenant with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis costs the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a much more predictable attitude than this subject.
The standards defined on Monday also show that the Agreement has been modified in the last days: last Monday, Morgan has announced the sale of 20% of its actions to Japanese college for an amount of $8,5 billion.
"And a week ago, Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought that our share would be exclusively composed of ordinary actions.
But considering the present situation of the world and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect us."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will receive the Morgan Stanley Titles at a price less than their accountable value of 7%.
And the operation would be translated with a investment of at least 20% of the equity based on diluted."
The Agreement provides that the MUFG can convert the half of its preferential licences into regular actions in a year if, during a given period, these last ones would be exchanged over 50% under the fixed conversion price, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital of the MUFG would allow you to collect investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase its liquidity.
However, a portfolio of the group refused to provide specifications on the strategic projects of the two new covenants.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a solvency cover of animal One is about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan claimed that he had "rightly" attached its budget from the end of August.
In the last weeks, the group has tested hardly, which has seen decreasing the value of its own actions, while the cost of insurance against risks has soon been emphasised.
The cost that he refused on Monday, however, holding up at a high level, reaching up to 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, a unique "oversite" between the large Wall Street investment banks after the throat of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the detection of Merrill Lynch, announced that they had acquired 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.

The investigation, which has been conducted in peace according to the electoral observation mission of the United States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" by the President.
This Constitution project is dedicated to the power of the state on ¤, reservating him the "development planning" of a country that lives mainly from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and therefore of their currency.

The 19 released stops in Ciad
A Egyptian command launched the exile to the rapitors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held prisoners in the wilderness for ten days have been reported on Monday morning, healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
On the morning, they were released in Ciad from a Egyptian command.
Apparently in form, the ships came to the military base of Almaza, near the Internal Airport of Cairo, to the 15th and 30th, on the board of a special aircraft.
On the border of a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to release any interviews to the printing, to Maadi hospital, a residential periferia of Cairo, to be subject to analyses.
They enjoy "good health" and no redemption has been paid to "the sequestrators", stated the Egyptian minister of the Tourism, Zoheir Garanna on the trail.
Repeated on 19 September during a safari in 4x4 to the feet of the mountain Ouanat, confinant with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of obstacles was discharged by a hide to another of 35 unknown sequestrators.
The group was formated by 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian – and from 8 Egyptians: two guides, four authentics, a guard of border and the director of Egypt, the organizational agency of safari.
A Egyptian security acknowledged that 30 members of the special forces, on the border of two elicotters, had launched the salt during the night, a little before the blue.
"There have been shooting, half of the sequestrators have been u·si, while the others have been fled," he said the demanded to keep the anonimated.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would support them by German and Italian commands.
The Ministry of Italian foreigners Franco Frattini highlighted the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
D we should admit that if we have received this result, it was thanks to the professionality and the men of our secret services, of special forces," he said, without adding other details.
Moreover, it has lost the payment of a remuneration.
The first day, the Sudanese army of patrol had stated that he had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on the board of which the sequestrators were located and had six, including the chadian leader of the raptors, and that they had catched two.
According to the exercise, sequencers would have been linked to a organization of the Darfur Rivers, the movement for the Liberation of Sudan (SLA_U), which was immediately dismissed by this last.
Letter - The silent majority of the culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current electoral campaign is focused.
That's much better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in shadow.
Who will pronounce the poor amounts granted to the small museums, to him, to the archaeological scares or to historical places in which they do thee?
What political will be to add to the Federal Government that is disturbing monuments and patrimonial buildings?
What in Quebec, like in Canada, do we not have true and own laws that actually keep our possession?
Did you know that the French government returns three million and half euros for the only restoration of the castle of Chinon in the valley of Loira?
Without our American neighbors, the Constitution is to say that the protection of heritage is part of the culture, and that the same possession must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this of common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of the History Society of Quebec, at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 companies for the protection of historical, genealogic, patrimonial property and property, preserved, with four money, private and archaeological sites.
They are exactly those who, often, holding our possession, protesting with the energy of desperation when immobilious immigrants and decision-making organs attack our residues and cimiters forget.
When will the right space be reserved in history and inheritance?
The governments of Benelux narrate a part of the Fortis
The Benelux states help through partial nationalization by the Belgian-Netherlands Fortis, which is in the first difficulty in Europe for the American Credit Market Crisis: the three nations will provide 11,2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The Governments of July, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for the Competition.
In the euro area, the first large crisis in the area of difficulties in which the internal financial market has been discussed for more than one year is that of the Fortis, and from a certain view, the decisions taken in this regard can constitute an age.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night all and three States will delay almost half (49%) of the quota present in the country.
It will sell almost securely part of its interests, including before all assets, especially insurance, of the Netherlands ABN Amro buyed a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis had started with a vertical cross, series of crisis signs of the Institute were then presented in the second half of the week.
However, analyses are agreed to believe that it is too large to allow them to go into failure.
The actions of the Friday have fallen nearly 12%, the lower point from 14 years.
Since January, the value of action has been reduced to more than two thirds.
In view of the current prices of the actions, the total capital value of the group is about 14 billion euros, but according to the leaders of this value, it is not real.
The company's top moves the cross of the actions Fortis to the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the American plan from $700 billion.
On Monday the title repeatedly to leave.
Wednesday Philip Dierckx was appointed a new delegated manager.
The financial institution has also searched for private acquisitions, but no one has submitted up with a meritable offer.
The Belgian government had already provided that investors should not be afraid of money.
Among the customers, the branches have not been discharged.
In Hungary, the Fortis has autonomous branches and has also bought leasing dites.
The powder in the powder
In America, living and health insurers, based on people's medical purchase data, often refuse to establish an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrolled.
"It is a program of privacy that the use of the prescription data of medicinal products depends in any case from the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in hands, otherwise it's like to trust the pollai to the volpe" - writes the Washington Post by quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicine.
Insurance companies shall subordinate the insurance tariff and the speeding number in case of left-offs to the health status of the client and, if they consider the risk too high, they shall not establish the insurance.
Sometimes ago, the customer had to attend a medical visit and the contract was established only after the exam.
Dick has found a much more economic procedure for 10 years ago: based on the customer identification code you can easily have information from pharmaceuticals about which medicines have bought in the last and half year, and from this the program evinces which diseases suffer and where health conditions are available.
For example, if you purchase regularly large quantities of colesterol reductors that means that the blood grass level is in practice inequality high and is classified in the higher risk category.
In trade there are several versions of the programme, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the assuranceer does not remain much, even though there are small difficulties.
Among the contrary, some medicines are used for more purposes, for example, some components are unusual against empire or warm vampates, but are also effective against depression.
This last, from the insurance point - commercial, worth as a factor of risk increase, the first two no.
In order to request and process data, they have been formatted and, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmaceuticals, they ask the patient's approval.
Now, the authorities have committed you to do this, even though they have not yet affected much for disturbances.
Some dictators recently develop the result of the tests and connect them to the medical consumption data to provide a more precise image of the health status of patients.
They always have access to data and parallelly the control of use will always be more difficult.
There is a law partly on privacy but its validity is only extended to health services and insurance.
In the context of the Congress, there is a legislative proposal that gives the authorities control power to specialized undertakings in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it does not suffice: therefore he has developed a program that connects the data transfer to the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot so much refuse the approval because otherwise the insurers do not establish the contract.
So then, at the end, the gallines are trusted in the clemence of the wound.

European Union and India dopped trade
Since the European Union and India are partners who are traded mainly mutually, the agenda of the ninth meeting at the top has been dominated by this issue, and all other global problems.
Today, there will be a French and Indian vertice that will be first to cooperate on atomic energy.
The European Union is the fact that India becomes a great democratic power to which it should be more voted in internal matters, but the Member States have not yet been able to decide whether to support the New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue in the ninth sum organized yesterday in Marshall.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as a president of the Union, José Manuel Barroso President of the Committee and Javier Solana higher representative for the foreigners, received the Prime Minister of Manmohan Singh, with which they found the agreement to duplicate in 5 years, which is to increase up to 100 billion euros, the trade.
Since between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has occurred from 25 to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious.
The 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have therefore been united legally, so air traffic can also take the way in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the agreement.
The goal is to balance because, while the EU is the first trade partner in India, New Delhi is only the nineth place between EU partners.
The vertice has dedicated attention to the global factors.
In the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the terrorism, this last condemned in all its forms of both parties and highlighted the convocation of a United Nations conference.
They encouraged the conclusion of the trade Round Doha, even though both parties had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed the continuation of the energy and climate programme, which would like to reduce at least 20% until 2020 the emissions of damaged substances.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that it should establish a global agreement on the climate conference for the next year and reduce from 50% to 2050 the production of silver gas.
They also want to breach the prices of food and have supported the convocation of an internal meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India today will be in the French capital where in a bilateral meeting it is prepared to sign a Treaty on the Peace Use of Atomic Energy.
In Paris, it is expected that for building Indian nuclear reactions the French dictators receive a composition of the value of EUR 20 billion.
According to our printing agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Francofort more than 300 Italian editors

Received the airport of Steve Fossett's missing billion a year ago
The airport of Steve Fossett was found, the billion lost on 3 September 2007 while flying in the wilderness of Nevada.
Rotations were found on a 3000 meters height in the Nevada Sierra of Mammoth Lakes, the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the flight, however, there were no human residues.
The sheriff of Mademoiselle County, John Anderson, fled the doubts that remained: "The air has been located, we have sent a square, and now we have the confirmation that it is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day when she disappeared" said in a press conference.
The sheriff therefore pointed out that no human residues were found in the air or in the surrounding area.
The billion, 63 years old, was given for death in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the delay warning was sent a cartridge, which then identified the equipment: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed from 3 September 2007, when Fossett decompressed from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from Nevada's border, some personal effects in Fossett were brought by a couple near their habitation of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents with the name of Fossett, both em. by the Federal Aviation.
Fossett's searches were interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billion had a place in the history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth temptation, the first man became to complete the world's round on a static ballon: two weeks of flight solely.
Three years later, he had made the world's round in aeroplane and without scale.
Among his many records, even that he fled to 15,445 meters of height, above the Andes, but with a childhood.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with a original design and well defined by determined lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the lastborn among the "compacts" offers of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give an advantage of news in this sector.
Just for its contents outside the traditional canons, it will be unexpected and not convened also the communication that will accompany the Launch of Suv Glk, or at the showroom Mercedes-Benz from the next 17 October.
Thus, the advertising which will comply with the debutt of the new vehicle will also start an inevitable mode of communication through a 3D future 3D service campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car mark.
A project of maximum offices, articleed in three different stages, which will dominate the central way of the milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the stereoscope car and thanks to special eyes distributed near Corso How can you see the new Suv in almost real and tridimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image will be the impression that the car gets out of the manifest.
Successfully, through the use of innovative technologies Elumina8 the new Glk will be lightened in different times in all its details, and then recompense into a single image.
Of course Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something again in the stereotype field of car communication.
Will you succeed with this formula to determine the interest of the future acquisitors?
Here are the Italian Hooligans
From the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls who all Italy is now confusing? They are part of the "Utras Italia" group who follows the Nazzurra years ago and who, for the truth, has never created excessive problems.
Never if he had been fighting with the tifoso adversary.
The extract of the group is right.
The promotors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These in Sofia have been added groups (a few units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the soldiers: Sabbath night they were taken to be not identified.
They're inspired to the English tifoseria.
In Bulgaria, they found a real nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian tifios 144 billets for the game: all nominatives, so easily controlled.
And the Viminale had controlled them all: among those Parties for Sofia there was no one with a current Daspo, no one who was wronged by attending a stage.
Four blue tifs, who had stadium crimes, were rejected and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale expects to read the acts that will come from Bulgarian police, then he will take advice: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for five years at least to those who have been arrested or to who have been identified in the disorders.
A internal Daspo, which prevents not only the Italian stages but all Europe.
Our hooligans, of course, won't put their feet in a stage.
For fortunate.
But now there's the emulation: that's that to those little more than hundred fifty, others are added.
"D we must sphere this incendium immediately and not legitimate who do so," they support Viminale.
So, "good eyes open you, especially in view of the Na's game on Thursday in Lecce."
In Puglia, there is a small nuclear of Ultras Italian supporters.
Tomorrow the Watchtower is gathered, marched on the Casms that can also count on a section of the Aise, namely secret services, who cares exactly about stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce Core and the tissue brace during Mameli's winter?
This is the thinking (deeply unfortunate) of Domenico Mazzi, a few weeks ago director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzientia was here from Trieste, where there is a novel of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, based in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzi ́ says, that in Bulgaria it is not wrong to invoke the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 tifios has been confused.
"I don't do the sociologist - add No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country where the fact occurs.
By now this group remained in line, now we will see well what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we also speak of the fashion in the middle of Mameli: even those who have not been wronged, but if you allow me to be not education..."
