UKIP residents who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those coming to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with this mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him particularly if people living with HIV are included in the adverse.
At the bottom, you use special arguments, then discreet them by a homophobie of no longer wallet.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to do the cow behind the intlerants to the chronic hypocondrie that think they're all dead.
I think that you are using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-handed cancles, does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only a UKIP parallel universe that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a torchon does not constitute a evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messager.
The Mail did not write the report, he just commented it.
Those who control the majority of media in this country should be thrown to propagate such a popular propaganda as if it was reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should take care of when you're trying to kill the debate by homophobie's initiatives.
The phrase of Farage was very surprised, but only because we are talking so rare about this problem.
He absolutely did no observation of homophobe.
You'll have to succeed.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I think you don't love when the media talk about what you don't love.
This is so rare because, contrary to Farage and his cingled disciples of Thatcher who think that the Sida and the inundations are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own incapacity to understand that the complexities of mankind are something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is also possible in Ireland and Spain.
With the new crisis that comes to the outermost period, nothing will have done.
Waiting almost 5% of growth in 2015 is a big placeholder.
Ireland the ''TIGRE OF THE EUROPE' was dealing with us, a few years ago.
We've seen the next time!
This begins to read the article.
We are trying to believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a 'NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE' is going to happen.
With the Brussels Agreement, imposed on the lowest companies in Europe, a triple work walk, a continuing immigration.
Take these ingredients no matter what 'pavoy' for the time with the Polish coming.
In the 1980s of the 20th century, Ireland was one of the poorst countries of the European Union, with Portugal, considering a constant perimeter without the new countries, the situation is still better than it was.
Greece was before.
Their development wasn't a long quiet river, it's on the view of recent events.
The lowest rate of imputations in Europe?
It's fake!
Latvia has a rate of imputations of 0% on enterprises.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France from the policy on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is found in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5 per cent in France.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that the road traffic has been greatly returned, and there are new cars (and dear) with all road corners, exactly as before the crisis in 2008.
I lived in Dublin for 14 years, the reception has been evident in the daily bowls since the return.
Should it be of the economic presentation?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon be burned.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra is involved in a croching on A140.
Does Ryanair now count to transfer passengers from a flight to another way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy all the new devices, so some boss and rays on the elders will soon be forgotten.
That's what I say I'm going to steal with him next week, so I hope that it will not be on one of these two once refined.
So that would be completely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay an addition to the passengers for the additional fear that we wanted to give them?
But without this type of Irish business, you couldn't allow you to leave in vacations, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it joy.
Any article on Ryanair starts tens of comments of people who would never take Ryanair in place of those who love to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic tariff have only to take it to themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs of this incident.
I'm asking what will be the delays and whether the passengers should be charged and, if so, if Ryanair could avoid paying saying that it was a mistake of airport aircraft controllers.
The passengers have been placed in another aircraft in less than one hour, and they have no refund.
Sorry to deceive you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome to the board of this British Airways flying the ISIS inside, not true as you say.
Good Travel
Last Sunday in Paris, the street of Francs-Burgeoes: Marais is in large pietonnier, and grey literally of the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (all for most of them) or for the Salon of Revise to the Space of Blas-Manteaux (hyper-intelligent and roughly pussyous).
The reason for this multitude is that the magazines are all open and that the quarter is incredible and animated.
I have many strangers who depend .....
Do you believe the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois, where the bottles are opened on Sunday, cooked by the world with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that I seem to be acceptable is the one of the areas that receive a major number of foreign tourists and it is deceived by the fact that they buy in decade.
Tourist areas lose a significant volume of business numbers each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where costly equipment, exploited on Sunday, allows prices to be reduced .
The dominic rest is a right which is beneficial, except exceptions, to the salaries.
That is why it is intended and regulated by the Work Code.
The economy's laden minister, nor the other, the foreign business charged, has the less competence to reform the work code.
So they're buckling it.
What does this law mean?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies who want to work on Sunday .
In Montréal on Monday apm I led my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30000 people where I live in France, the municipal library is opened 4 days a week but not us!
This is the access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of working time.

What if the success of his daughter was, against his will, used to pay the costs of success?
There's some paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
Of course, his succession would like his part of the gateway, if you're talking about me.
His preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas in their own enemy, and also to hate his well-known hate of the people.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I don't even.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940, he held the other arists of the Government who wanted to discuss a "contract" with the Nazis and won very rapidly.
Thanks to his great retoric and energy, he joined the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and the Equatic, and, at the end, the whole world can thank God for having been in these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's size has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the peinture on the free market to collect the money of the costs of success, they could even benefit.
If the public wants to add one in a museum, they collect money to buy it.
It's so simple as that.
But we could use the money of taxes.
No one can deny that, when it was “the time of truth, Churchill’s personality was a positive benefit for his country during the Second World War.
A renewal of the internal market by public travels will only contribute to large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding embauding, and infrastructure chanters are not renewable.
As regards the social reforms of the Minister, they reflect the real francai bad: the defiance of the dialogue.
Return to the main values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Or we are solely to his aid, or he has DROIT in exchange of services that he has made or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.

The small genius of the Finance is missing one-like imagination.
The new deal was a policy of large businesses, but at a time of care in large infrastructures.
Today, in Europe and in France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are safeguarded.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, therefore, in nothing a new deal may be a solution.
In particular, at a time when the issue of decrease is responsible for a recession that is only a brutal decrease.
You would have had the right for 30 years ago: more need (or options) of bargage, carbon mines, authorouts...
But if we want to reduce the future climate-energy choc, then the need for investment is crucial: isolation, renewal of the railway network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A taxation that promotes high income and rental.

Samsung's benefits are lost by iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
The Middle-September introduction by AppleTM of larger raisons for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seized buyers who otherwise would have buyed a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for the benefit of →.
I think it's essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft placed this philosophy, we met a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer because they are not compatible.
For me, I have tend to buy Apple, because I love their philosophy and appreciate the design.
Some people do not have any value to design, for them options, functionality and prices.
There's nothing wrong about this.
Let's stop looking for "better platform".
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different but similar.
I would like to see a flowing mobile industry, with radically different approaches for people and different markets.
It's healthier and must be comforted.
This is our interest for all.
I'm glad you've found exactly what you're looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I've made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who fight the ideas and not men (in contrast, on Paris bobs) could tell us what authors they fight the ideas of the kind and indicate us the books they hear just fighting.
Or do they just attack the kind described in the Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is their sources Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you well, and you're someone intelligent and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the vineyard of Furusato evoking Holophern, a closeness that didn't come to me (I don't have his mind's life).
Otherwise, in the "fond", because you reveal it, this matter doesn't interest me, and I really don't see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends could get me out of my arrival, because I'm late but I understand well...
@ Jean:‘Culturally, return Judith to Holophern, it is.
Who's afraid to ask the World?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us answers.
The first by calling Judith of the Bible, the second by qualifying Judith Butler of a very symbolic tranchant of grass.
We see how much these studies affect the most intime with them.
We are no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Did you read, Jean, that the World has made an article on the need for theology?
@: About a debate of idea I thought he had to go to sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only exposed that make their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Genre Theorie or X Lacroix, theologian ) does not make me very ridiculous.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it is all the difference between having a clear opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure that he understands the nunce.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic tranchant of greenhouse, I was satisfied with "The Second Sex" (it was more than my time) which I believe the source of "the source" of Lo's wills.
While I looked at the ållipse since Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon was briefly shown when the clouds were opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had his charm and had a little deception of having sometimes the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here in FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really include the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a time.
Special moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give him his true colour as soon as possible.
That's yours, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne then, naturally, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also succeeded to cover the whole week of Perseid's weather rain and for almost all important astronomical phenomena in these last years.
I start thinking that there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is not really the best place for a observer, even if things are greatly improved from the other side of the Cordillère.
There were periods from 10 to 20 minutes where I couldn't see the ́lipse because of clouds over the campaign of Melbourne.
I'll put a TAXE on this lipse.
QUUICONCE looks at this ́lipse should pay a TAXE.
I think your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just as the last one before you sleep.
Who or what will oversee you when he (forbiddenly) ends by disappearing?
It is that you have long time to read the discussions by searching for messages in which people criticize Abbott government to then accuse EUX to be obsessed.
Great photo of the moon above the Harbour Bri of Sydney.
It seems like Mars's going to go in a clue with the Earth!
Nothing on bourser and immobile speculation.

Go to this Tuesday 15 October, the results of wonderful receipts: in Spain, exports have been lower than five years.
In Greece, the bullet goes out.
However, it seems to be the examples to follow.
The reform of the notes would generate a request for compensation for the order of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy claims that these payment requests are not based on.
What in the case of a mistake of the Ministry of Economy?
Will the decisions who have increased the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the noteers have the same courage when presenting the facture to the state budget?
The rest in his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
@lol No State is not comparable to the households in relation to the management of its budget because the timezone of the State is theoretically finished while the household is born by the duration of life of its members.
Furthermore, unless the costs are unproductive, these contribute to the financing of maternal and immaterial investments from the growth of the morning and therefore future income.
Some elements of response.
A regretable decision.
But remember Hippokrate's sacred promise: the health of the benefits of the world pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first.
Nice theory of the complex.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn't correspond to your fantasm.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands associated with the law as the policy provides.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risked chirurgical interventions, shoot rooms for toxicomanes instead of having them in the streets, etc.
Politicians want to enjoy the incult mass on these issues.
In fact, doctors don't win money with medicines.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't win money with medicines See the Liberals want our health system to be responsible to the United States, you should learn about how it works.
Everywhere in the world the doctors are covered in the same way, but it's more or less.
It may have been wrong to put the mistakes on toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of companies and to the "search".
Read therefore some rare reports on our expenditure from Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on the negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the worldly prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is being sold freely or only on order.
This is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirect.
In fact, some enterprises do tests on marijuana inhalations against oncological pains at the same time, despite the laws which they have and the necessary honourable permissions.
Although the manufacturers of some medicines may not be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those who come to a version of good quality products to known doses will benefit largely from them.
I'm sorry to say to you, ma'am, but you're missing, there's a lot of things happening in the cools for doctors and pharmacists.
As regards this hospital, they were pleased to use it until someone puts the puzzle in the ear of a responsible for this hospital.

If the researchers in social sciences were making research instead of making policy and networking, they could be used to use their "travels".
A researcher, he doesn't compare a fact to another.
Compare isn't looking for.
Comparing is to do no pedagogy of research.
You can't say "the search is supposed to apply it" and then in the same jet "they must experience everything right."
If your research is surprised, why do you experiment?
If your research is not surprised, why do you ask you to apply them?
Can you explain how a "search" can deduce that one who can't compare only matematics could easierly compare matematics and other materials?
The news allows us to learn the condition that the people learn to use news, but how would they reach the news if they don't know?
Pisa tests are only a indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfied.
What does it mean to build an indicator that tells you about what you are doing, a will of automobile promotion, a troppery?
One song to train teachers: remove sophists and idealists from training and practices teach practices.
Fabric refers to the paragraph on stages (which is not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion moves us to the most ineffective conservatism: "This is a device that leads to the reproduction of the practices which are not able to make the system " .
With regard to the general consensus on the status of the French system, only practicers can teach practices, even if they have their place in a modern training of teachers
Education theories do not have any place.
The practicians must have one of them.
Would you like to be operated by a chirurgian whose training is purely theoretical, and who never put the foot in a previous operational block?
There is no consensus on the causes of educational problems.
Giving more weight to the education teorers, it would be to destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally furious: if I wouldn't like to be operated by a practicer who has only a theoretical training, I would like to make it less to work by a chirurgian who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the taste.

The lesson No. 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and make it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have passed by a click.
Maybe if they share the listeners of their mp3 ballader with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled to violate the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource that we rejoice, the railer who says that everything's wrong....

I have two children and when they are old to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing changed from here.
France draws people down by continually assisting them.
I don't want my children to support the obligation that this policy will have created.
What's going to France down, it's the talks like yours.
@gus I work in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies managed by excellent business heads: it exists in France but it's rare.
I'm payable because I know that I don't have the powers to lead a company, and this choice allows me to take red bullets on the zero patrons that I often meet.
In my baskets, I share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the terrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with German companies that the French business leaders continue to cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany, companies have been structuring their industrial tissue to make it competitive, in particular by providing the link between large and medium and small companies - What are the French patrons expecting to do so?
What's the State holding their hands?
This State they accusate of imperfection?
@Jacques L.
Always this anti-equipment partner from your side!
Remember me, what have you created as a job, as a value-value, to be too serious?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is confronted with an insolvency problem: the incompatibleness of French business heads that are unable to create employment and who build and threaten by waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: elimination of the Work Code, patronal charges, taxes, 45 hours/sume paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, are able to claim the loans low other than their elimination!
I'm quick to see all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic to see the way people always blame on the First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last was not really a investment for us contributing.
They tried to keep their flight rather than to transform themselves.
This doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't been improved since Last is busy.
But they were also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don't have the power to do this.
I tried to have recently, but I didn't succeed.
But well, the Labour's gonna take us out of anxiety, isn't it...
It's a international branch.
They have already operated trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom to create more moral business and to participate in offer calls.
But that we are not very good in the management, most of our private services are finally managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticisms when first received the Virgin contract, all of this to finally cancel the decision.
And it is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has taken the Crossrail operational contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they repeated us during the Referenndum campaign, is totally for common and shared and thinks that workers must all go outside the borders.
Therefore, they may be able to be happy with this decision ;)
It may be because the Netherlands management is on good rails while the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchise, not the franchise.
"It was a girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Suppose that the fact that being "bading" is a quality greater than many others, the concern of others, intellectuality, listening, for example, the fact that being "bading" has nothing to see with him to survive to a disease: cancers "batters", which are not less dead, I know the palances.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with the debt.
Come on, let's start again.
I don't tell you that it's the condition to handle, I tell you that it's AIDS.
Nothing's done with anything worth...!
When in examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
It's a recurrence.
Insinuating, it would be only an instinct, that we can have the debt to get out of a disease or that we can demerate not to get out of it, it is just monstrous.
The body follows or doesn't follow.
A body that leaves everywhere, despite the will, despite trust in the doctor, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think about the contrary, if, having a solid moral, it is certainly possible to easierly accept heavy treatment and prepare it, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not fear them.
Someone who's a doctor is first someone who trusts the doctor.
But if we prefer to return to the Lord, it's something else.
Not with the debt or with courage.
These considerations are suitable to the moralists.

I thought the accusation against Milosevic had been decided and completed a year ago.
I haven't seen that name in the journals since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His process was conducted "fastly" and then below under the pipe.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The Nationalist became a nationalist who deceived three wars in the Balkans during the last decade?
The President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we voluntaryly left on the side: 1.
How can the NATO bombardements be able to be strict in accordance with the international law rule?
What is the country of Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that the NATO has destroyed the same pattern by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way to get out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he would be broken by the West Compressor Roller.
The O≤aux used a smoke to discover a part of a sovereign State who then unilaterally announced its independence and was emphasised by the Otàl States who later denied the situation on the ground.
Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleaning).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, was politically dead after his first mandate for not to understand the situation that was developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversed figures of the political world at the time.
Finally, Guardian should not qualify Milosevic of Tyran (although we don't love it).
Only in Greece there is a method of predicting seisms runs nearly, measureing the piezoelectric level in the quarter.
This type of studies is useful and thanks for making us share the results.
So hope is that this water has nothing to see with the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, which is about 124 years of light of the Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to present detective water moles”, a study conducted by the Drake Deming team and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
The method to follow.
Like those who involve animals feeling a threat to come.
Thanks Passer of sciences to regulate us often from these experimental evidences that are performed in the world.
How would animals know (forward )?
Of course, by the perception of other elements whose rate is developed in case of seism.
Like the radon, for example.
A gas has inodorous priorities for humans but maybe decelable by animals.
All these methods are indetectable for humans, but not for the measurement instruments he has.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed (and since centuries) that some animals have acted strangely a few hours with a seism, including powder, powder, dogs, but especially fish and serpents.
I had seen an art report relating to the fight of two scientific teams, a Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their travels, which were leading to animals to the earthly magnetic fields, and especially to their change before a seism.
So I'm not scientist but their hypotheses convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why so much misunderstanding against this track?
We should learn again to listen to the nature...
If we examine the things calmly and strictly, we can see it in a serious review, and no one deceives it.
As we speak of the "signs" given by the animals, we are on the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a seism the red fish turns rarely around.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservators.
He made it too much as the maire of London.
When we listen to the LBC program, we can avoid thinking that this man knows nothing and that he always trys to divorce with a blague.
He never answers directly anywhere.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to make himself elect as the master and he didn't have one.
It only underlines how much the rest of the Conservative Party is a fucking collection, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News For You. ”
Because it's a célébrity and we've inculcated people's worship of célébrities.
The Londonians voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the direction of the party, the popularity cot of the Tories will cross the plafond I'm sure.
God helps us.

Let us see again, and proudly show that the British are big travelers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red goodness that has manifested against taxes is happy to know that this travel is sponsored by the British Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, I feel that local collectivities and public agencies should not be dedicated to our taxes to financ the dreams of some adventure even sympathic as those!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that originate cosovare?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, sometimes at the Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they are still in the team
It's Bisevac the defensor of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a middle of land or before in the 70s and 80s and led many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is Mostar, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attack in the great team of Velez, which, under the tutorial of Senator Suleman Rebac, completed twice in the Yugoslavia Ligue (and also counted pointures such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsene Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
We said he'd be a big player when he was at Juve, he's currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar he was connected to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as I know he's not a titler there.
Maybe he may still do something, maybe in the Super League of India?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which includes all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much degree (which I know).
In fact, it was a Albanian flag with the map not the name of the Great Albania, but from Albania before 1913, when the large European powers decided to put the country back to neighbouring countries.
How could we have felt "a joy-explosion" by seeing two tours increasingly knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How?
What encounters me a little in this "teaming" is that the only fact that I could, once, would be spontaneously enjoying the terrible death of thousands of people, testifying in my eyes of a "border line" personality whose all "teaming" should be taken with the greatest circonstance.
Of course, in short time of "rejoice", we would not have thought about the dead or the reality of the inflicted fear.
We would just have thought, an instinct, that, for one time, Muslims had succeeded to do real and apocalypticly bad to the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Great.
It would be that this feeling was divided by thousands of muslims broken by their humiation feeling.
Aunt of filmed witnesses in Palestinian.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We had a little doubt about it.
"Christian/bla/gaulois" can't measure the degree of frustration, wrath, hatred of the museum when it contains the general mistress, the social and cultural development of the Arab Muslim world today.
I'm talking about Cair or Alger's faubourgs, not Dubai's tours.
The past, probably magnified, is not a comfort, in contrast.
How does the muslim world get out of this diabolic darkness?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigue the Arab world: the bigot conservatism of local powers and the fascinating nitrosism.
The common point, the yellow of thinking and excommunication (douce or armed) of its critical expression.
What we've learned before, don't have to make the Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Eve Plenel read this article?
I guess it's true in many countries.
But in Great-Brittan, the autumn marks the beginning of six long months shadow, humid and depressive, which affect the welfare and humor of many people.
Moreover, everyone falls sick.
Sessional depression.
I'm suffering myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes the hell for me and those like me.
A vitamin D dose should help a little for humor and well-being.
The car is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign is particularly to cut the suffle in automne.
Not as much to cut the souffle as the green of the east when everything is alive instead of being at the point of rubber.
In Great-Bretagne, if you have a chance, the sea falls a week-end.
We've had a good age this year, don't make your brilliant who's throwing the clichés!
Not everyone.
I'm rarely sick in winter.
But now I'm at the retraite and I'm not developing immunity to the germes outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not at the point of rubber, it's just a stage in a cycle...
A marvelous step full of inherent winters, with a febrility that covers with festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of angry and full of other wonderful words.
It's enough to stop doing things!
This is my recommendations for the feasts for you.
Yes, these dark and gris months actually make me much more happy and more detained.
For the monitoring of the increases for children , the amount of the State is mainly coming from deciles 8 to 10 .
However , in the case of the number of employees who have seen their tax increased by this measure , these are particularly deciles 4 and 5 which are concerned ( median incomes ) of Charter 2 .
The elimination of the half of the widows in particular is not of all treaty in the article or its impact is completely evaluated: 230M of euros is a placeholder which does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and sub-in-of-the-the-of-the-the.
And it's not ready to get out.
All right, we're not on the board, but on the minds.
For one time the PS does a policy instead of the left we will not cry...
It is evident that those who are part of 20% of the most rich must support more than 75% of the increase of taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue this way and you'll encourage these 20% less working or away.
Well, I know, that's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Live the Trots and OCIs recycled to PS: they understand everything.
Adam, you feel bad about what you look at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population are 80% of the riches.
A fair tax is when he prohibits anyone to put as much as he can.
Besides a certain limit, money loses all its use.
And when it's over the use of money, money is only to do money, it's to do the greatest number's badness.
We are part of the 20% of the richest.
Of course, 20% of homes who work the most (and create riches with a part of which is logically re-distributed).
A equitable tax must allow these homes to benefit from a part of their efforts.
Or then so much to break your arms and live social minimums, especially if we have a social apartment .
The utopies of head-coppers in the red khmer are happy.
I recently made two AirBnB in Norway.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we hadn't had to present us at the receipt or to face the less traces.
It's enough to go to someone, sleep there, go back and share.
This will be my first option when I'm on the road.
The logo changed, people...
Check your assurance before praising your home.
In most cases, you will need a kind of owner's assurance.
Please use a service with the good logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risked" No, it's not true.
You just missed happiness.
According to the link provided in the article:
At his download, the response from Arbnb to Teman was quickly, almost absurdly quick.
In the 24 hours, after a e-mail delivered to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a lock to change the locks, taken provisions to pass a week to the hotel and transferred $23.817 (for which Airbnb is assured, but at any time).
So why does this article cite the Teman claiming that he has not received any support from Arbnb?
I HAVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Good morning, I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to make sure.
I'm going to pay an account and a month to spend a time but I'm afraid to send 1 600 £ to a site that I have never really heard.
But where are we going?
“ Support the crowds, ” the Bu$herie sang on all yours...
So inoffensive weapons.
I am sure that this will please the families and nearly thousands of holiday dead curdes to learn that their parents and friends have covered to something other than the chemical bombing of saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically performed by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
In addition, how would this mass crime in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons covered nearly 20 years later were still useful?
It is not hyper; the author's owner's: "for the search of massive destruction weapons.
We're okay.
You believe it is the time to defeat the army to strengthen education
It is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war.
Alternative: Is it the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
We would have already strengthened education if we were working 35 hours instead of 17 hours.
At the same time, our teachers are currently winning more than ingeniers.
And that we don't believe that teachers past 18 hours a week to prepare their programme.
But this does not seem because the National Education does not have the means to provide a office to his professionals, so they live with them.
A kind of telework forced in sum, unless the employer pays neither the computer nor the Internet connection nor the supplies.
Moreover, it's the plan at 17 hours a week and 4 months of vacation that we don't come to fill the Math CAPES, come, wait for you.
How do you not want to coltinate wrong-learned clears whose parents crack you by training you as a chairman?
I think the priority in this area is to disarma the dejaadites so that the Khurde population can improve.
There we see that Bush's administration has absolutely all the facts of transition.
My first graduated job was in the sale, in London, to win three times nothing and however it was a job for which a diploma needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be open for the London metro, it was paid 5 000 £ more per year and it was not even asked for the patent.
I've never been sorry.
In this regard, don't do that if you don't find a diplomatic job, try to find something that pays good, or you love to do.
If I had stayed in diplomatic jobs, I would still pay my student's job.
I don't love the business work so much, so I hope to end or in the function or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article comes really late!
Exactly, when I received my diploma in 2011, there was already a three-year arrival.
The best way to reduce the number of diplomats without employment?
Dismissing bisunor papers such as art / letters / theater / media / philosophy / political sciences, it is what the diplomas of unemployment are called.
I have one of these diplomas and I ended the manufacturing director.
It appeared that the importance was not the diploma, but, as the article above, a good professional park, starting at the oil and throughout the university.
Certainly, the department salary was lower, but we are quickly ascending the stages because in the real world it is the results of more than knowledge.
This debate of engineer studies / artistic filières has been held for years.
Scientists can't solve all the problems, it's more important to be able to get up to the morning, to come to work at time and to interact with people in a way that results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bisunor papers?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about the type of media studies or whatever the absconde file where you've gone.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and arts are of real filières.
We need people who can explain the major issues to the students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and value them.
Wouldn't this be better a real territorial policy to disengorge Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I feel bad to see the residents of the end of Essonne and Val-d'Oise make 80km around every day to come to work in Paris.
Inside-murous and small cinture people have already many other practical means of transport in common (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several safe and closed parks, as it already exists in the cities of North Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the surroundings.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is channeled by the 2RMs.
In fact, it is hoped that the town of Paris works with professionals in the Netherlands and Danish.
Such benefit from their large experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for UN SEUL drilling device.
The motivation is stronger when it is to find a office for Bertrand Delanoye....
Well, it's not all right.
When talking with petroleums and other transport users in common about the reasons for which they do not pedale, it is to me that the main reasons that result is: 1/ is hyper dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these shooters who run super fast and run out of the survival of the cars 2/ are full of pollution in the head for me the cyclable tracks are gone, it is necessary to reduce the car rental (type congestion sword), reducing the speed (Paris = Zone 30), keeping the road code systematicly by speaking with the wheels before it is needed to adapt the code of the written road for bagnales 100 years ago), generalizing the bumpons after the closed passes, and they do not shoot.
The cyclable tracks are the apartment, we need to cooperate but reequilibrate the employment of the city space.
Nothing on the wheel in the Great Paris?
Isn't there a word on the place of the wheel in common transports?
EELV is right.
The aim of 15% of fast movements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the green in the wheat.
In addition to learning what the OR reports, EELV adjoints have skeptics.
I prefer to be optimist.
Before the racket begins, it's better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: This is not Russia.
Not sure to love the way the world develops.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the CEDH, but I didn't hear that a complaint was actually deposited.
Moreover, they should submit complaints to Germany or Ukraine.
I also appreciate that these matters will be repealed by waiting for the result of the question report on the age and the question that would deal with it.
Yes, but Libye did not explode Pan Am 103.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault of the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was he before?
Other aircrafts have been disrupted, Ukraine launched in the area of air attacks against rebellion, and all aircraft could certainly be considered as a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of evidence threat or has he chosen to play with innocent lives so that aircraft companies pay the rights of survival in the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their Government / the west Ukrainian ultranationalists - and who want to demonstrate that Poutine has disrupted the MH17 flight.
As I know, there is already a complaint against the Government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
It is: a Court of Justice of 1986, which concluded that the delivery of weapons by the Contract forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States were responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia leaves this case to the CIJ.
It is amazing to think that Abbott wants to say to Poutine that the Russian rebels have been embraced.
I hope he can present evidence to deal with his claims.
To this end, the investigators haven't said anything about this.
Named Ricardo and be such a eco beotien, it's awesome!
The name to be Pollar is losing the north is happy.
One question is: Is the poor today poorer than the poor yesterday?
I can't stop noting that those who criticize the Piketty's most virtual book haven't read it!
It's easy to read, I put a few days.
It shows the statistical development of income-production, capital income, inequality-concentration, inequality income, capital property, debt and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital is associated with the beginning of the 20th before 1914, showing that the two world wars have decreased the capital concentration from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration occurs after...
Bernajuzan: You don't say what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pave, knowing that the concentration capacity of a person has some limits.
Then the question is not to know whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central tess given by the press is just or not.
If it is just, it can be discussed without reading the book which is essential to argument in a unique sense for this.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you have to read it?
Is the central tess of his pave summarized by the press fake?
I haven't read and I'm not reading it.
So I am at the summary of his central tess, and that is the one that seems to me pure smoking.
The concept of art between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Isn't the humanity globally enriched?
And this enrichment to increase the population is the true political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is a impressive personality and deserves the price without doubt.
But remember that she's just 17 years old.
A age in which most people begin just to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a bathroom for the girl and she'll find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of the oeual governments who want to prove the old adage, which is the incarnation of the evil.
All my pleasures of happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or otherwise - even in the populations of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her many freedoms but mentioned that if she wasn't there where she was now, she would have been married at 14 years.
Malala itself doesn't be part of these "perverse colored"?
You shouldn't have any "anti-time" on this site.
You're a horrible perverse.
It's absolutely revolving.
No, her father wasn't worth marrying at 14 years.
She was 15 years old when we shot her.
His father leads a school where girls are schooled and he is for the equality of women's rights.
It is, and it has always been, so that she may receive a higher education and have the right to decide herself about her marriage.
In addition, it's someone inhabitual in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that a average Pakistanian girl must often marry at 14 years, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't express her in a sufficient way to you.
It may be contradiction, but maybe she wants to say that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years.
Soon deceived by this income in the 4th season, especially by Jessica Lange, who has a little wrong to find her society of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two samples that are pretty different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horrors, one of the most excited!
A first fascinating episode.
The accomplishment is close to the perfect and the Jessica Lange show sing the anacronic Life on Mars de Bowie is just reversing.
I have not yet looked at this new season (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to have only 13 stationed episodes from 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is sure, outside Jessica Lange's extraordinary, is especially the risks of setting in scenes and mountings that have been sent to me.
In AHS, there is an avalance of original plans that does not reduce the assetisation of today's production.
It's a little bit to see you throw the epoch in front for the next samples without even waiting for the ability to hurt the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pilier of this series, but you say so well, there are many other things yet.
It is not simply just for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how it uses it) is actually one of the piliers of the series outside the technical quality.
And good bah, I'm looking very much at her.
Then I find that the series is sinning by writing, she wants to do things too much at the same time.
The 3th season was below, in the 2th, it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 samples of the American Horror Story or it's gonna end as 24 hours.
But everyone does what he wants!
That's why I say "I'm not going to look after" that everyone's required to do the same!
I just share my viewpoint, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal.
But after that, here, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less of tax increases, please - let's raise the State's expenditure.
No, let's increase the expenditure, please.
Those who wanted to get in the expenditure failed.
Run polymetics on relatively less important expenditure posts, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the error margin in the expenditure of the Government in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we all are talking about nuts rather than the change of orientation that the electors call their vows and all this time some, in each camp, seem to be much more important and sustainable than they are - and the electors see part in their game and find them bad faith.
Less than 1 % of the expenditure.
The "debt" is of assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
The debt is nothing that it fails to be concerned.
I would not see any problem with the government's adjustment to a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought he would use it as a well-scient.
But that is not the case, and many contributors have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been really honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, high speed 2, subventions to nearly unusual eols and nuclear centrals that cost the dual of what they should, you reach a number that makes the tax of the Labor and the Lib-Dem on the most luxeous residences.
Your first 10 000 pounds are not impossible.
This means that someone who wins 35,000 £ per year pays about 5,000 £ (a seventh of their salary), someone with 50,000 £ would pay about 10 000 £ (a fifth), etc., and someone with 200,000 £ pays about 70,000 £ (a little more than one third).
What about social contributions?
More social contributions, more local taxes, more stationary costs and car vignette, and it is before the VAT.
Almost 30% of my money is taken to the source before local taxes and car vignette.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm glad to pay my taxes.
But we don't like to believe that money falls from heaven, or it's not important to know where billions of tax books pass.
How can an unemployed who looks for work at the port prove that?
Even though 20% of the unemploymenters would not look for, it means that 80% are looking for and not finding.
As I'm unemployed, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recruit receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances of that.
In fact, I have no news from Pole Emploi for months, that means that agents are more occupied with control operations than to actually make job announcements?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not the State to provide work.
If Pole Emploi doesn't provide enough posts, then it's needed to pass from Pole Emploi.
What is it about a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in the case of the unemployed persons who are in the contrary to their rights.
As a controller requests their transport title to users by means of transport, a service manager or the salaries of their work, etc.
Nobody's crying to the scandal in these cases, right?
It is really good to recall that the unemploymenters have rights: the only two times when I had been in Pole Employ, my rights to the ARE have been wrongly established, and on one of the documents, amputed by 40%, it had to be battled close.
That takes time!
I'm not a legal expert.
Fixing and control takes the above currently, while statutoryly Pole Emploi is near to be an insurance company.
I would like that the subject of compensation should only be concerned by the salaries, they are paying the quotations.
The political and non-salaried French have the rights they do not have!
It's not normal.
I would like to have a worthless unemployment insurance involved in the assessment of the payment work.
More than waiting for tits in Arabic...
In fact, there is a direct military response in Iraq /side that will stop Isis so that this virus does not affect this conflict area.
The situation would then result in the spread of black sea in 1348/9 in relation to war and movement of people at the time.
The Saudians had the spirit of prohibiting Hadj this year to the Mexican Muslim perlers from three touched countries.
The Country reports that 7 400 have seen their request for visa due to their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a perlerin coming from Bosnia who contracted the variety in Mexico during Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a perlerine coming from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it no heart to propose to prevent Ebola’s sickness to take a plan for Europe?
I thought it was a simple good sense but apparently those who know have decided that we could risk the life of saying thousands of people...
These countries in Western Africa, where Ebola is out of control, should be placed in 40 strict.
No one's lucky.
Only health staff can enter.
21 days of expectation after treatment of patients before they can go.
If they contract Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconic measures.
Nothing that last week, people have been contaminated after having been contacted with people in Western Africa, although they have taken "all the necessary precautions".
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is mainly spread by aircraft companies.
Let's prohibit them to flee to those countries.
Moreover, customs agents in airports should be trained to repeat people who have typical symptoms of Ebola, so that these may be immediately put into quaranta.
Let it come to pass the message of the first and the group (including religious) second and he will have deserved the Nobel of peace.
I doubt that it is able to arise the image of God in dogma, which is characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from this design here.
This is only 20 years ago that information appears as the first given of mankind, while religion, the issue of the brain, maybe leads our actions from Lucy.
What is the interest of being a one protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minor in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would no longer put their feet in the Church, but there is only a few protestants in France.
What's the next step, the sense of sin, too "angiogic"?
@louise: I'm sorry the church has no limited vision to France.
And in the world, maybe that will allow to touch more worlds...
@Martine E, to be honest (as a habit) respect for others as you predicted in Christianity.
Hillel a century ago said to him: "Do not do what you don't want to do to you, it's all the Torah and the rest is just a comment: go and study!"
The Christianism goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the agapie.
Your "progress justice, peace, brotherhood" but without god?
Is it a return to communism?
Procedure step: Incarnation and resurrect are removed.
Jesus will remain that herd who violated the moral laws by redefiniting the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to play their role in the ethical debates of our companies and to promote justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of protestants in France is mostly explained by the fact that their formers have been extermined and turned into force and moved to immigration a few centuries ago.
I have too much to buy this, the new alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is quickly out.
It's not inventing.
I personally would choose SoM.
I love Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its funding campaign) but I don't think that it is 30 £.
If this is the PC version that interests you, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM to 30 £ and also offers a reduction of 20 %.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM to 30 £ and also offers a reduction rate of 20 %.
I'll look at it.
Of course not at work.
The rejoicing of the informatic department blocks all sympa sites.
Hello, is it 30 £ and 20 per cent of reduction, or are 30 £ to include 20 per cent reduction?
However, attention: The PC version is only for DX11.
I was surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Moreover, I bought it on Steam, so no refrigeration, it's no.
It's time to buy a new video card *which makes the gueule*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would have feared that one day they would make it out of your library if they decide to seize people who buy it there while they are out of the region.
Please join the Elite beta version: Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a "curride terrace"?
So tell me, this Nobel price seems to me to be a lonely gift.
We need to love France of 40, the "defeated stranger"?
When we see who gets the literature Nobel, we ask if Proust or Dostoijevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even a event, we do not even want to read the first authors.
From Brazilians, Chinese or Âtens will read Modiano who is already hardly readable in French and who describes a so limited and self-emotioned universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more creditable but I really doubt.
Modiano, Levy, Musso has only a remote report with literature.
Did you read it at least?
Or another Nobel price?
It would be better to judge.
As regards Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to the literature and the French culture, they.
They will be able to appreciate Mr.
Modiano to his just value, if they don't know it anymore!
On your side, continue to frequency Lévy and Musso.
I'll share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
Then let's see who got the Nobel of literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello.
Since I conducted an Iceland, I've not stopped seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing followed me up here.
Maybe she wants to hurt me?
Or get me like the horrible Superman III?
Hello, Dantra, always hate the hate?
Hello, DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Thursday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last week, I went to the Beer and Notingham Cider Festival.
It was border.
I've done 19 different birds, Wobbly Weasel is one of my favorites.
I was welcomed by the mixing of people there, there were only CAMRA fanatics (and not confused with the camera fanatics).
Keeping back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to the grandfather of a friend to play nine brag cards.
Thanks to a real chance of starting, I could share with several decent jobs.
I hope if I'm 95 years old, I'll be alive as he.
I went to a kid cocktail bar last night in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a lad tranch over.
I admire M.
Read a little Bouddha and you'll understand how much you're wrong, dear Christian.
I think you're going to get a little away from the subject.
This whole whole, it prohibits the search for dijadistes to the outcome of the Mosquees.
She's signaling the weapons trading without late.
Or we have large open eyes like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker, or we have large eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It's not by keeping the closed eyes to the light.
Excuse me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental contrast: the whole of the authorities, organizations or representatives, muslims or not, formally condemned the EI and its crimes, the French, the Muslims, or not, have nothing to do with these unnimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say the word.
The problem is that people like you see them out of front like muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I said, thousands of times, some have doubt of the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and insensitive to accuse them first and request them to demonstrate the rest of the French society that it has wronged.
This principle is, in my eyes, the negation of the Republic and can only contribute to the delegation of the French society.
If there's no doubt, so say it.
Who doesn't say word, but what?
Consent to a closeness with EI or a conviction of EI.
Silence is well practical, it is the main weapons of those who want to bear the cheese and choice.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically intentional.
Alex Salmond foretold that the Ecosse could, during elections, "venge" from the parties represented in Westminster because a great football was crossed between their decentralisation proposals and what they promised to watch the referencendum on independence.
Cameron must be penitrated in the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron has to smile.
What are these threats?
The Conservators completely deceive the Ecosse because they have no seat.
They can do what they want in any electoral impunity.
I don't think that even Cameron is very stupid to believe that the Labor per ́s sitting in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservators.
Who's going to spend a weapons for the Worklist Party.
They will completely eliminate in Scotia by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their head into the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he saved his party but without notice that he signed the dead stop of its Scotch members.
Not surprising that some worklists request accounts to their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in Parliament, even if the seats do not come from Conservators, they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and can force the Conservators and the Labor to do what they promised for a maximum decentralisation.
I think that's the importance of this.
Not if the Labor or the Conservators want to be repeated on a day in the territory.
It is not a super electoral strategy to cite 8% to 85% detriment.
Moreover, since the Spanish Members cannot vote on the subjects related to England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he's.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists, and that successed him.
However, he is still in school to be the Prime Minister in 2015 and since he has received the direction of the Working Party.
So greatly, these boxes will be behind every player to look over his box and see what he read, how he read, and even to the end.
It's "The Life of the Others" of East Germany or KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
At the end, this will at least have a sterilisator effect.

Greatly stimulant.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I am still reading pirateed files, books of the public sector or buying to some editors who have the intellectual intelligence of offering files without mouchard.
Because of the price I paid Kobo, it's unfortunate.
I am aware of the generalised accusation of users because of the generalized asset of their private life.
In your large public library, you will systematicly note that everyone gives his loyalty card (f*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding leaders of work whose opening and end-rates are probably disturbing.
For example, “Finnegans Wake ” of James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Ear of the Big Data, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Attention to not put the entire literature into the same.
Anonymous data collection when there is a profile....
The collection is not anonymous.
These are the data provided by Kobo, which are not allowed to identify the players or the authors.
But Kobo has all this information, he.
There were so many exagted, misleading and contradictory statements from the Turkish Government in the last days that the country had been conducted by a class of full of skizophrene skisophrene under acid.
It is still worse than this if you take into account the religiousism of Erdogan.
It's interesting that some partisans of Erdogan think that the islamist is such an insult that they supplies your comment, but not my. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to take a ball into the foot, unless you win something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will repeat, so it is actually to take a ball into the foot.
A diplomate at the retraite wrote on his blog: "The AP reports that Iran has observed the United States that it would be a mistake to reverse the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad law because it would cause Israel's security to be dangerous.
It is not in the article if Iran sent there a serious warning of repractions or if he simply advised the advice.
This second option is more strict and, in all cases, it is really surprising that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment relates to the Israel and the security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is to emphasize anyone who takes attention to details rather than the traditional media balanced c*neries. The short article you give is important and should be read in mind by keeping real / warnings coming from Iran about Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “modered” who are seriously fighting the terrible Laic Assad and at the same time losers of ISIS?
The policy of pipelines moves the world to the abime, and I would suggest those who refer to “modified” inexistents to make more attention to facts and alternatives before sending children of others into the Third World War.
"It's still worse than this if you take into account the religiousism of Erdogan" Are there other religious alalists in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
There would be a process of Nuremberg for the Armenian genocide made by the Turks.
Should he have?
Do you realize that neither the hedge nor the victims have the least chance to be alive?
A little late for this, my friend...
Wouldn't they be old now, about 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Especially about the CUP triumph, which planned and managed the genocide, Talath and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by vengeance by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolcheviks in a nearby-to-day central Asian paumed place, when there was a dream of founding there a Turkish empire.
What a delight!
A impressive control of the sophism of the fatal pent, but otherwise, we are looking for the real contact.
What no arguments.
The foetus will always hear a heart that strikes even in the boat of a portrayal mother.
Lesbian couples may have been just a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
The sterile heat couples also.
What the kids!
What a shame to design them as future psychological unbalanced.
One day, they will have age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to win their lives and to pay the retraite of this lady (?)
The GPA is certainly a temporary "solution" in the development of our world's medical development.
She doesn't give it today.
Many women took and placed in the world of children who were not their husband.
It's still like this, we've been doing so...
The importance in this matter is that this practice is enhanced in order to limit the "marketing" of the body.
But the steady chirurgy, the cosmetics are not also the goods of the body? !
Anacronic Fair Unit...
It is certainly more legitimate to increase a good country remote through the Internet and Pay Pal than to acquire its responsibility and to avoid scandale in another centuries close to yourself without calling it at this time on all toys! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who do these practices...
There is not less than the exploitation of the body is a real problem.
Oh, please, this guy's disappointed by something.
At the end of the 70s in the Midlands I just saw this far.

But if you love this and listen to music - this music today she always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so bad comments on what Paul Mason says, maybe they are placed by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sport section there is an article on the foot that expects your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's movie, there is a penalty of reports that really reflect the reality of the Northern England culture.
No wonder that Paul Mason has taken the social and political context well, he understands things well.
Northern soul lives still, but it has been vaccinated by capitalism and today is essentially a surface phenomena.
This means, you can cast an ear on it if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will pass again from soul vineyards, including full of Northern soul, on Sunday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "all the same story," but here's a small article well written and well thought.
your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you've disappeared in Newsnight.
Last train for Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and down to Wallgate.
They've got pills.
Whatever the garage before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes from Wigan after buying a billet for the stop after Victoria!
The starts of the Northern soul are described in a excellent episode of the George Gently Police Series, named Gently Northern Soul, which is in Newcastle in 1968.
The cases become more empowerable.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never rates a chance to delay a chance to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou doesn't seek peace because he wants to continue working-colonising (in addition, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electors have all preferred peace employment.
He took his clothes, put them on the rock and entered into the water.
A Israelite had stolen them to him.
The Israeli representative arose in anger and voted: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN)sourit and →a: and now that things are established
Israel and the majority of his people have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority, and they will not be guarded ...
That it moves to the Israelites is a evidence, it is not the purpose of searching ...
Antisionist: But I answered you, I translated: the world geopolitic report ...
And it is still so since the Policy is globalized...
Eviting, avoiding...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certainly lost!
For the creation of Israel, you don't answer.
What strength report has allowed Israel to create?
Antisionists: The conflict of Israel and Palestinian is still a strong report today!
You're doubting?!
In addition, this does not only turn around the Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have a pain to go beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyst billets written without others.
This proves that you don't understand what Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a sequence of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter, which would mean that it's a question of immorality).
A very vicious burden, with just a doubt of the conscience that Brand says some truths, perhaps of the truths to which we prefer not to think.
Increasingly, this feeling will be more spread!
I can understand why it is horrible for some: it is sometimes speaking in a pretential way and after all absurdities of tabloids, he actually gives the impression of being a popularist starting, but all this story of not voting has been completely wrongly interpreted after me.
The general consensus is that he only tells people to not vote and rather cross the arms and ignore all the political process - but if you look at the Paxman interview and other articles/video that he has posted, he says that to vote once every five years only for the Labor or Conservators (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and to limit the democracy commitment to this is completely unusual, the two parties (in different degrees) governing essentially for special interests, multinational and rich undertakings, at no time he says simply to ignore the policy because these parties do not rule in our name: it insists to say that rather than just to vote and disconnect for five years, people should be able to do much of political efforts, in order to demonstrate the most important levels.
I don't say that I am necessary to agree with its solution (for I think that being politically active by presenting his requests can go to the fact of voting, since politicians are a giruette that will change the opinion if they really risk losing elections), but it is rare to see all these consequent answers that say that this idiot that makes Jesus tells youths not to take the penalty of voting and just hope that everything will be better because it is really deforming his arguments.
His solution is extremely discussable, and it would be good if people discussed what he really said rather than simply label it as unresponsible and put the concerns of him and a large quantity of people left for account.
Yeah, thank you.
The matter on the vote has been completely deformed.
The inevitableness of putting a bulletin into a urne every 5 years is deeply anxious for me because my vote is not really accountable for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic vote, direct democracy and Members who are locally accounting for their electors.
In addition, I repeat the idea that the proposals of Brand are not its (written by others).
It is sufficiently smart to have his own proposals and ideas, even if these are strongly influenced by the type of thoughts and universities anti-establishment issued from the anti-culture that Suzanne would like to re-group under the label "pseudo-chomskyst billets".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convinced Suzanne.
Perhaps that is what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne did like Polly Toynbee and interviewed on a veranda, with even the head-cooks on the mount!
As Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended by being one of his fans and invited him to his emission, it is too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come.
It can be in a political speech that exists since generations, but which has been marginalised by traditional media - including Guardian - since generations.
This "found" is particularly evident in my eyes that the intellectual debate has no longer been held in the RDVs of the history where the staff stories have become minority and where the exchange of specialists has been benefited from condensed premises type Sciences Po for pressing dossiers.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Fo
They develop the one and the other of the very rational reasons, but this rationality is based on these emissing boxes that are the key to vote in their mind.
Instead, I believe that the State was vital for Fo^ault as a guilty.
This refers to a very archaic thought, the victimal thought, which is also the magic thought.
We resolve the problem of the report to the other by eliminating it.
There is anarchising, neo-lib and / or /libertarian pent ( of the two terms the second marks a duration of the desire to erradicate the State , the first knowing to go to search for the state's markets ) in the meaning of the least of the State / not of all State at Fo日ault .
The old dream of the base that is self-being .
His thought is built on State's faultlessness: without that, it does not stand.
He who is guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here .
No other support.
The totalitary left remembers the good old time, the one of his gods, Staline, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you have certainly read a chouya too quickly if you have taken the texts of Fo ́ault on Iranian revolution for Khomeiny's apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent wouldn't like to attack Michael by this way...
Left puts a deep reflection on the contemporary and collective individ, on the difficulty that represents the access mechanism in our advanced liberal companies.
Whatever we agree or not with him, it's an original and respectable thinker.
See this orchestrated cabal by researchers in humous sciences from the heavy left that do not support the allocation to their hands is sufficiently riable.
The narcissism and the mass of these people are unlimited.
A important point to ▪ I am to be the posture of these "rebells", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "gel" I was witness in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure to hear our Australian friends about this subject.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were famous about me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia, the last time in a market in the 1990s.
The Chinese think like the Blass!
My family lives in age after he came from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still have some of them to keep things violently anti-Blancs.
My father is not happy that his old daughter goes out with a Bla.
I also believe that the attitudes have changed to Russia since the 1990s, especially in the past years: they are more rich, prosperity is spread outside the great cities, and through this prosperity people are traveling to the foreign and seeing how others live.
What I have been told is that the Russians have particularly prejudiced to temporary workers without qualification originating in Caucase and Central Asia, who work in offices and areas where they have a lot of opportunities to be exploited by their employees or against a high crime and violence.
Although I saw the borders of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the opinions of the Chinese and Aboriginal.
It's really strange that a foreigner says that I don't support the Chinese, while I met two of them in my life (one in the foreign), not keeping bad memories, all people are worth and, in fact, those in London were very frequent that I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise, we don't remember who we meet, all people are worth, how to remember who it was.
You know what's funny?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're always going out with the Bladé.
How many Chinese men are with Whites in comparison?
Nothing, because there are many chances that the parents of these Blanches would attack them PHYSIKEMENT.
No measure of inpartiality of justice.
However, this is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups highly marked on the left like the syndicat of the magistrate...
@Marabout: I am sorry, but the Jewish environments are honestly marked right.
When in the Syndicat of the Mastership, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativeness of the application of laws in the courts, it orders to separate two obstacles.
The political vision of the observer as the factual interpretation of the judge.
It remains then the law-based tool to renew the assessment of the areas.
The measure of its unobservance in the case of Judicial acts of judges, including parquet, forces to operate a distinction between the error and the partiality of judges.
It would be worth claiming that the acts of justice are not separated between these three groups.
Pretention and unconsciousness do not involve an objective analysis.
And then, if all this is not analysed, how can we say that justice is improved in France?
If it is only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it is very low.
The preambulent allows you to correctly record what is followed in the third.
The Corruption* of the Mastership.
It is sensitive in proportion to the power of hurt* which is granted to the Judicial institution capable of such heritage.
The area concerned is the spoliation* of heritage done by means of crocheries to the procedure* by follow-up genealogists mandated by noters.
This profession is a good year of 150 million euros but benefits from the cover* guaranteed by the nearly immunity of the French notation*.
For understanding their mechanism, a party was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this approaches the statistical improvement* moderated by the commentant, the Judician institution has produced many differences between genealogists and inheritants that are able to promote so, in contrast to all laws favorable to the inheritants.
Isn't the presentation of European statistics ignoring this type of rational criteria then a form of lie?
The prices are probably totally active.
Return the material to arencate the handicaps.
It can be said, but my brother has one of these area tricycles, built in measure by its size and weight, and it really allowed him to benefit from full air as never a normal wheel, with wheels and wheels covered, couldn't.
As we say, the goats and the colors...
The Tankchairi remains to what Jeremy Clarson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like EPIQUE.
I think Whill's inventor never had to clean a dog cross on a kitchen.
I'm sure my sister would love the cycle everywhere, but it's just too sweet.
The looping ultra long distance wheel would be perfect for a handicap with a penchant for the longboard.
There are some people who would like them.
The prices are actually high, but there are actually people who put this type of price in a wheel, then you see.
The whole territory tricycle is especially useful for me.
Not all the handicaps are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount insurance.
Only if they became handicaped.
The thing is that the market of rolling wheel is a nine, so they can be allowed to practice high prices for things they perseverely know that it is necessary for us.
We can't really say Whill is minimalist.
It's an example of design-sif.
Unfortunately, it's just a bathroom, it's not intended to make it.
I THINK that the "long distance" wheel doesn't come on the market, because it seems that there is no way to drive this fashion thing.
Approximately 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive bombing of tensely depleted residential quarters.
Two million people are prisoners of the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying force of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
The half is children and youths who are less than 18 years old.
Eight-year-old children have lived under Israeli blocks!
Single situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation, also because this block affects a “collective penalty” with all the citizens of Gaza.
" Undertakers who work on their projects turn a little from their ciment to the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the wood language, rather than the beton and the lady's armed...
References are here to support a argument or a fact.
Antisionists...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and recognized.
Two million people are prisoners of the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007.
Single situation in the world, unacceptable situation for everyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States have a well-conserved land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to rule because the dictature (who you know) excluded it!
Don't forget as well as after he raised it, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I'm a O'al, so I'm approving...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israel-Egypt...
Gaza's children live on a subterranean fortress, built against the people who chose her mothers!
Having a ship, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've been thinking well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Arbnb.
This is even the definition of the share economy without profitable purpose.
Many are just looking for a bit of a night on Couchsurfing.
So it's to pay (or at least expect it) in another way.
It's always much less than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
Furthermore, owners and lovers who trust themselves often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in species, involving Airbnb.
Where is the community in all that.
"What's it placed on"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The term "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's a international journal now, if you wouldn't have not noticed.
It would be better to have the good assurance for the ship, make sure that it is 100% in accordance with all safety rules and ask those who manage channels and employment to practice a commercial activity (what they will certainly do). I have a ship and I tried to see how to lower it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, in short, it is really a cauchemar...
Did you think that battles can be moved, stepped and repeated, cooled, etc.?
The pennys are so late that if someone tried to steal it would always be near where you left it.

Not Marine Le Pen has no right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one who exposes the facts!
Poverty increases in France.
More than 150 000 young people leave the oil without training.
The ability of richness in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends?
Who defends what?
It will be said in 2017!
The capitalism will not be opened!
The high finance, sp, plays with our enterprises, therefore, our jobs, with our primary materials, so our purchases, our foods, our health structures, therefore, with our debts.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our silver they hold.
All of this will benefit from those hyper-mega-obesses of the fridge.
Until the contrary, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy, it's the finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the Ministry of Economy an elder of the Rothschild Bank, a story of better defense of banksters' interests, only responsible for the crisis in 2007.
Was there nobody else of competitor?
You're calling this how: back his clothes, kissing his bag?
Primary and popular response
In fact, we don't know too much what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans have been able to secure the surrounding.
I'm not sure that Spee has really "behaved" to secure the surrounding.
One of the aspects of this battle is that no party seemed secure to the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cow in the area.
The sea was hot at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any more difficult salvation operation.
Compare this with the next battle, the Malawis, where, on the photos showing the surrounding showing, we see a quiet and full-day sea.
Moreover, the salvators had no more in this stage of German fighters in the area.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I made a quick search for Wikipedia:
“A certain confusion reigned among the German ships about the outcome of the two cursed crossers, who had disappeared in the black after they stopped the throat, and a starting poursuit.
Leipzig has seen something in fire, but he has seen that it's just a copper.
The Nürnberg, lateer than the other German vessels, join the battle lately and see Monmouth, penished and seriously hurted but still moved.
After pointing to its projectors on the ship's pavilion, the proposal to be made up and opened the fire, finally running the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee thought that the Good Hope had to escape and stop research at 22:15.
Inquired of the reports indicating a British wheel in the surroundings, he put it to the north. ”
So, if that is true, the Germans, in the darkness before the invention of the radar, didn't know that a ship had fallen, and they couldn't find sure.
They also thought there was a more important race of the Royal Navy in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in the confusion they were struggling to benefit from their advance.
They were far away from their base and Spee had aware that they should run a road through many ships of the Royal Navy.
The victim of Cradock had already caused them wrong and had covered them about half of their munitions, condemning them so when they were finally taken.
There are several votes to the OMP to ask that a finally convicted electoral should be definitively irrelevant.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch elects of right left on.
But nooon, it's a blague.
For this idea I propose an inscription to us with the Masters
When is the prohibition of syndicates in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality be tolerated between citizens?
As a result of politicians whose view of society is limited to these sectors, it is always quick to admire those who will benefit from their inappropriacy to involve the actions of true policies, who are really trying to move things, not the nice talks of immobilization in the measure of their presence.
I met them in the metro towards the midst with their small pancarts of the undergrounds for justice" they came from the province and did not differ between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of political syndicates whose members have the great power they have in the service of its party.
It would not defense the same thess if right-handly, even extremely-right syndicates designed for the purpose of its board's personalities and leaded to a legal-median war against them.
Your statements are totally free.
Yes, the right now defrauds the Judicial presentation is just that it has done facts that take up it!
We have no example of left personality that had so much to do with Justice, but all those who had taken care of it have not had any favourable treatment.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to recall that the Syndicat of the Mastership that is left is not the only syndicat of judges and that it is a minority.
That a minister with so much commitment supports syndicates show how useful they can be.
@MCR The syndicat you cite may be minority among the judges, but its influence is great in the Chancelleria, it is not a secret.
We are now wondering if the "mission" of certain judges is not more to go out than to teach.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minor.
What are you worried about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the judges are not officers like the other: they are the only ones to have the power to put into captivity and capture everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if no of the participants would come back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most hungry debt of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, then I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as tremplin to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the world's stages.
Others then sold many disks or left to West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programmes, launched Chreyl Cole, which is actually part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all have made the Eurovision concours as many others.
While others such as Frank Sinatra and the rest have participated in concours in the United States.
In the 70s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks have launched most of the British TV stars.
Of course, some have fallen in the forget.
But that's what happens to most of the stars who do not participate in concours.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed to do it.
In any way, most songs / groups can best expect three albums and a best of.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name, has only fans in the United Kingdom.
His célébrity is part of his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who is Jeremy Clarkson.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to move on a career than the typical road of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the rocks who ride the woods in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem level of primary school will certainly become stars and that the only question is how they want to touch before even exiting a album.
And worse than ridicule: it sets a completely artificial distance between the western public and the studied people – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because the sacralism ethnologs present us these people far as extremely superstitious and ritual bigotery petris, while most of their ways of doing are extremely equivalent to our and inspired, such as ours, practical considerations daily.
Unless you are unreversely interpreted.
Or, but rather than say that the tomb is depoured of holy character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières also have a little holy character?
Our trip is as reminded of seeing the holy as a kind of well-defined and circled object to the religious spher.
It is very interesting in what it is.
It's the ephemer deco to mix the empty.
Nothing else.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrated figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of holy is still living.
Who still believes in the interpretations of the archaeologists!
Any other discipline would be put to the orties of the interpretations not from all scientists who endure the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a critic compared to discipline so that we can slow down a little?
Because what is worth for archeology is also worth for interpretations that give other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of health modesty.
Your misunderstanding for the archeologists is actually injustified!
It is because they are continually covering treasures, valuable witnesses to restore history, understanding companies, and the example of comparative archaeology here is tremendous .
This method is not very old and previously the archaeologists believed in their "instinct" and their knowledge, and to be found.
Today we have technical and scientific means so perfect that the interpretation of fo's is better but can always be replaced in the case of other covered!
It is in full (and old) polyemic on the challenism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (see the book "The Challenges of the Prehistory", especially the increased edition of the scientific controversy, issued in the Editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this strong instructive article
Heather men love anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put it.
So it's done between us?
I don't really understand why we can't continue to three?
This journal should be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall in the cave?
No, but we're not against a teater room there above.
We couldn't look at a musical comedy up there, but it would be too gay!
We could wait to have such a comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Because your test offer is almost finished, I can suggest you to go to Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more with you.
He prefers mykedow.
I could suggest that we all look for a journal that pays true journalists, courageous, so that they write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and dangers.
More than to make ricane with these cups of cups.
Not very bad.
Then go.
If these "building bullets" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, isn't it?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle-Orient and Ebola and that it is actually possible to do both and to make anal sex article?
Is this the subject that shoots you, or is it the fact that people hurt it?
Nevertheless, we find the crash amateur video on the net...
Amount video of crash on the net...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the driver.
If the FOM wanted to protect pilots, it would have been safe because at the moment or another vehicle (e.g. deployed) would enter the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhon that we knew he came, but for which the FOM didn't think it was good for the time of the department (TV, pub, silver...).
But otherwise, they protect the pilots.
Of course, I also share this opinion.
But there is also that if the very british FOM makes the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to restart the Property which then led...
You're leaving on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I've got a little time to break all your c*******ries.
No, just not.
There were conspirations in F1, but never one who puts the Commissioners in danger of death for a long history of the possibility of winning a pilot to detriment of another.
It's not the FOM who's out of security because it's the FIA.
Size nunce.
In view of amateur images, the absent of images allows the FIA to avoid the genuine questions of the type: How does the Commissioner take a green flag in full intervention and continue to do it after the a ։ (see the full video after the a©)
No, it isn't because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the AIA but because one of the commissaries is looking at a green flag, it signs that the course can retreat normally and that it is more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a shadow inknownness of the F.
Yes, beloved Etienne, the course is no longer under the yellow flag APRES the place of the a·, from which the green flag is aggressed.
This is the usual procedure.
The position of commissary just in the basket of l'a. (unless, it may be at 10 metres as 100 metres after the a.) takes the green to tell the drivers to recover a normal time.
The sensationalism sells from the pub.
Before I thought the media were part of the " patriotic" propaganda of the government, but I am very afraid that it is just for money.
And sex, don't forget sex, fear of not having sexual life, pub and media are good to sell things that must improve our sexual life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Make the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry is just to keep fearing people so that we can continue to control them.
"When the tabloids are all about Ebola, we all catch the fear" This should be "decreasing", not "all".
Because of the medical reference, “toster ” is better said in this context than“ breaking. ”
I wonder if everyone who believes that Ebola could be able to spread through airways realize that they now believe in evolution?
You make them too honorable.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the Apocalypse that approaches.
That's the Antechrist!
You confund Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concist article that smiles nicely and solidly this abject pseudo-journalism.
Well, it's good for me to get rid of it.
It depresses me that the media talk about most of the things with this optimism to the opposite.
The goal is once again to keep us quite scared and anxious (without reaching hisstery) for the Government can make us lose when he needs it.
I think it's perfectly logical that if we have to submit a budgetary emergency in the absorption of any crisis, a terrorist urgence in the absorption of all attention, why not have a crisis of Ebola in the undeserved case?
It is that this government seeks to save us from the crisis that he himself invented.
Is there not something difficult with the idea of governing the fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for being still from this world almost 35 years after.
Moreover, it must have been terrible at the beginning, see the context of the 1980-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the sure to go over there for years .....
The testimony is perfectly unusual.
Like always when we're talking about sciences.
Not only witnesses serve nothing: taken isolatedly, they cannot use scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of facts.
@trafic: witnesses cannot use scientific material.
It may be why we should be able to ask questions to patients in psychiatric when we have confidential observations from neighbors.
My psychiatric dossier mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathy educated by her beautiful mother.
So this is a target symptom.
When I say it's the fucking thing, it's a subjective witness without importance.
Ah, because the certificate of a fact (= here this witness, which proves the contamination and efficiency of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific approach?
On what are you based on research, then?
On fantasms?
Do you set at the same level fantastic theories and facts (= providing tests)?
"Resilience" means the bidon word adulted by the grand-mirs, fans of J-L Delarue, which takes place for big psychologists after reading D'ansmbourg.
@Jim: There are empty buzzzwords in the psychs.
Cyrulnik has made us the “resolution. ”
As a big scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have bricked us a reliable scale of measure to quantify it, this resilience.
Did I ask if the air Sentineles could save us from Farage and company?
Doesn't that make you think of the Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to survive the air Sentineles...
So why?
It was a generous series, and it seems that those who show it have aware of it!
Let us therefore give our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to do so that children can cross?
The only solution that comes to me is the humor type of pipi-cacaca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
Children were throwing up.
Ah, because it's a series for children?
The UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Always in Supermarionation?
This will not be the same if we don't see the children and the animation is done well. :-)
I'm quick to see this (when I'm an adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain of refining old people.
The series has almost never stopped to be distributed here in age; it makes at least 40 years that we have episodes from one hour on Sunday and Sunday at 06 hours.
Since the free digital television is a few years ago, it is on one of the second order commercial chains and we can always see it at these hours.
Moreover, the episodes of a half hour past at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a "trist" guy of 60 years, but I don't look at this series every day!
There's no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosquet of the spiders!!!!
The radical sionists invented this to provide a political ability to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all Israeli fo's fo's beast and around the Mosque of Splandes have not been allowed to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if there is it is else.
Can he be in argentin?
This mountain is not searched for the simple reason that it is the mountain on which the plane of Mosquees has been built.
His top, or the dome of the Rocher, is swimming in the middle of the Omar Moschee.
For the Muslims, Mahomet is ascended to Paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriya where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextual, there is no propaganda but information, dear K1K.
Israel also counts his extremists, it is good to remember it regularly, and they are unfortunately relaxed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the last had accepted the plan at 2 states, and they continued!).
It is so good to show how anexion of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his people?
The shortest of the Jewish blague: "God is praised!"
To overcome the tourism in Israel, we are often shown youths in the middle of deceptions, languages on the beach.
The reality is, like habit, very different from what the publicity shows us, as we can see it on the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scared at all.
And this photo is a wonderful work of propaganda!
It is damage that the photograph of Reʹs has not photographed the hundreds of Palestinians authorised to return to the Mount of the Temple and prefer to cail the faithful Jews in contrabs, praying to the Mure of Lamentations.
@Mat, If this photo hurts you, it's right, it's not the journal or the photograph, but this woman and the idea that she's going to be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end in weeping.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy goes away, large enterprises have benefited greatly from their employees.
They succeeded to convince their salaries that they had the opportunity to have a job and that they could not allow payment, while at the same time and without hiding themselves, they gave more important rewards to the small elite at the top.
You're right, it's not permanent, but it will only change in this country when the workers will really speak of one voice.
Instead of rashing and dege when someone else makes the grew, support them, showing a little solidarity and understanding that their greeve does not only concern their problems, but also shows your employee that we don't deceive people impunity.
Unless we leave democracy, what if, it's permanent.
I'm totally agreed.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
As for example China and India.
All this can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Party of Commerce and Investment (PTCI) aims to increase the benefits of the companies held by these people by short-terming national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but this is exactly what the mechanism for the regulation of differences between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the Agreement is.
The Verts are against this project and are trying to warn people about the inimaginable degrees that this agreement will have on our lives.
This is only recently started to talk about in the media: Indian Guardian World Development Movement See therefore these links and you will understand what is negotiating in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "of blood, sugar and lamps"?
This is what makes great retombys, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next low maillon will certainly be the car market.
The Lord's right, at the 18th, there were syndicates in all regimes.
In the very French Catholic Army, there is a victim dimension.
Leave it (endly, her officers, others, nobody knows anything) to believe in the coffre-force of France's external values, and she'll be locked and closed.
And then with the decline of the country, the globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, quickly: the dissolution of the idea of the nation, having this small religion, it is comforting.
Even if for her, it's more incomprehensible...
You still miss the syndicat of married men, celibatary, married women, celibatary, lost dogs, and I don't know anything else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm singing.
You're warned, it's gonna be your fault.
In order to defense categories of interests, the protected professions of syndicates have already been sufficiently supported, which has caused a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are prayed not to laugh about the fear of the risk of a officer.
We can well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without syndicate, or then without the right to grew like in Germany, contrary to the protection they play.
In addition to a safe disaster.
And with the charrettes that are prepared, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance actually...
Ignorance for the ignorance of Sybille I made an allocation to military and other officers, because this is the subject here commented...
Let us remove "with its delegates" in article 8 of the 1946 preambulation.
It will be "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of work conditions and the management of businesses."
This is absolutely vital with the irrevocation of the informative power.
And yet you opened, probably read, then commented a specially titled article "The Great British Bake Off review". ?????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought it was supposed to start the conversation.
In any way, it's Joffrey's marriage I've seen, and I can tell you that some have been well seated.
In Joffrey's marriage episode, we have one of the best moments (who's foolish: it was the wine) in the TV story.
So, from the map mmmm...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time that, strangely, the emission ends with a victory of the least worst bulling; no one has done a kind of "boom, here is my bastard now buy it and touch it before your master"!
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has finally affected them?
The weeks, all of these foreign people were held at the art.
And there is also this idea of playing security, always the next week, which disappears last week.
I love kiss, but I don't imagine to influence this.
I am worth those who do it and thus offer us a super fun and move us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge of the last year, the wedding gate, was absurd.
Professors usually set days to do them and they are able to brick them within 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to leave, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
In Luis, the only true defect they could have found was the base a little dry (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glace on Richard's molecular didn't want, in any way Richard had already lost at that moment).
I must admit that several challenges of this series are a little artificial because of the time of the impartial.
There is also the cancer that goes, with the sun wind rocks.
Of course, all of us are successful at this time.
A bad time to pass for mankind, we hope it.
You confund solar wind and ultraviolet rayons.
UVs are locked mainly by the ozone box that is just formed by the impact of the solar wind and the UVs.
So even if the magnetic field was dismissed, there would not be enough solar wind to throw out the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, so less than UV and "cancers".
Happy that the ozone box doesn't block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't doubt.
If we are limited to humans, they are interested in allowing us to have bones (vitamine D synthesis), to chauffer us (not less than the infrarouge), to modulate our immune system and, if it is, to improve our moral.
The ozone box blocks cancer UVCs and allows UVAs and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you don't have to be condescensive and consider your interlocutor as a stay when you put a comment?
Especially for a small precision that was understood in the comment, which himself hears to prove pedagogy.
Without saying that I am a melanome habit, UVs only make ACCELER its development.
They don't PROVOCENT.
For example, all brassed people have not necessarily melanoms.
Or, when a toubib tells you that you need to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it is better not listening because UVs are needed for all humans.
The excess, however, is like all: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly provoke the melanoom.
Can we pick it up?
And, more important, can we pass it to the mixer?
or go to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be completed if there is a sufficient force and the solidity of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resident and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a first-line communication material.
But for us others,
It's a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be broken if there is a sufficient force
Besides Nokia 3310.
More precisely, is he already covered?
We're doing this blague in each debate.
I decided to count them.
It's the fourth blague on the plague I've read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before installing specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and it is wrong to see how it could return to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....................................
The most important is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and which is therefore co-initiated with the installed business test code.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on all?
Photographs on Ebay show the absent of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah the article for bobo by excellence.
We want little dear products and we surprise that industrials produce in "industries' We put in front super u, but all teachings and meet the small trade are concerned How to buffle good, bio avac 1650€ (medium salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
Everyone is free to place his priorities where he is.
For my part, food is one.
I'll take you off. I'll take you.
They are called bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through a ideological "software" that led them to disconnect realities.
That's the total degree of thought-raison.
They are gesticulation experts, for example, suggest to save the planet because they have avoided taking a dust.
There are also experts in tartufery, joining the left-caviar, which sometimes are exposed, for example, by condamning CO2 rejects, while acquiring their vacation to Maldives.
The majority of our concitoyens do not support this mixture of heavy and tartufery ideology, too, is not surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theory and for all associated details (aeroplane, dust...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I don't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecolos are monoblocked.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
And you are able to understand the concept of the boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just a ideological nunce.
The classification would be more complex if we were interested in schools.
The boboecolo is partly, but it only represents the most ≥ schools because it is the one who affects the media.
That's a beautiful girafe.
Clearly, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She's so bad that she's not worthwhile to a woman's noise.
Chut, you're at the place.
It must be a part of the art microcosme to understand the stupefiant beauty of the truth of this work.
But you just don't have any ability to make a comment because you haven't spent many decades to study and flatter large artists.
The importance is not that Emin doesn't know of them and always obsessed by the same subject.
It is important that she has really succeeded to become fabulously rich and fabulous by having no artistic capacity.
That's of the art.
No, it's a cochon.
The fact that Emin doesn't know of these
That's not really a fair fact.
Instead, it is a opinion.
Unless the only thing you could appreciate is reality of dogs that run by playing the billion.
Judging art may be difficult, but not in that case.
From these, it is much more than simply representing the real.
If you're just looking for this, a camera will make the case.
The author also speaks of Emin's expression.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the type of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are other things to do: equity activities, the number of republic guard horses or the status of generals that are no longer active....
L(honority requires to say that France reduces its effects, but as all countries did, sometimes more drasticly, to begin by Great Britain.
It's just half encourageing...
The operational without support is quickly located in its limits!
A single approach, at the time we observe the weaknesses, the lack of our defence tool, particularly in Sahel.
A bad course for the local collectivities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuation?
@edmond: That's what I said, look where to do economy, but especially not at me, it is really not possible...
That's exactly what you suggest to do, look at where the gigi is sure.
Let all those who have covered a little or enough military thing come to say here, the eyes in the eyes that there is no money stuck in this perimeter and this without ridicule...
To apply the same potion to the functionality and funds will go a little better.
And for Josi: really hours: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministers and you will understand why the Defense can be a little charged!
Well, the economys on which everyone agrees to say that we need to do them, but it's going to be seen somewhere, right?
Many of pots, those on whom it falls to the rubber when it happens with them, poor dear ones.
It should be, but especially that it doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and not a economic.
Guig's, go!
In what way will closing the Vale de Grace afford our defense tool to Sahel?
As regards local collectivities, the story is repeated to each post closure, maternity, hospital, casher.
But everyone is for the economy.
It is strange, a Major UMP who wants compensations and does not enjoy economics performed in the expenditure.
This article is really the most important thing I've ever read!
At this moment, the first three people who comment the same bad blague make.
It's the depression to scroll his Facebook file and to see that 80% of his friends started their status by the phrase "This funny moment".
I think they're going to make a movie.
He will certainly be based on lighting scenes where someone falls by hazard on his ex in the bus and goes to work and only realizes where his jupe has come back into his cow.
It's not funny, it's totally with.
Not really, I believe that the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to enhance his emotions and to shut the teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return on scene after 25 years of absent was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now in the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can't comment.
No computer.
Oh, my God, I have to see this movie before I'm throwing!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has actually shown that he's all up to the top of the kosmical universe that is the sathrial journalism!
I'm going to go back!
Absolutely I need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have illinumation and discover the incredible lighting and the incredible genius that swallows Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine lighter.
Oh, my God, it was really no.
Especially if they are not women or travesties.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracy: the assembly of regional policies and effective associated initiatives.
Until the new order, we make us confiscat the right to save our planet by States who play the tartufs at each meeting to save the planet.
So, citizens, we decide to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner they planted on energy, all these beautiful recommendations were enveloped ....
Translation: Oil and sun closes are the Round points tomorrow.
Everything financed by the constitutional.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
pollution is not limited to CO2.
The radioactivity is much more weak at its waste level and in case of a.
As long as the branch is not managed in its integrity, it is better to limit it to workers.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, in a sense of drastic reduction of our consumption.
The election by the renewable to fight CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned.
Nuclear election is no CO2 emission to production and epsilon for other steps.
The election by the renewable oil or PV is already more than GES on the other stages and especially gas, or worse from carbon such as in Germany, to intermittence.
Put the nuclear by the renewable oil or PV would be against the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't injure you I'm State doctor in sciences 1981 I've done more nuclear research I'm putting you in the challenge of proofing light contrary to what I said.
For what I haven't said, you're the one who makes me ideas I haven't said anything about Germany really nothing you haven't answered to what I said and as all right people demoll the interlocutor I'm never doing.
I also refer to you to the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current programme of Germany for renewable energy is an ineffective and ineffective way to reduce GES emissions and should be arrested.
0 emissions if you do not comply with the extract of the ura and the construction and if you do not count the low-effective gas water vapor that Co2 is actually reminded of the two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear part in water vapor and a little in the water of the cups.
I stopped reading when you spoke about Pakistan as a "South Asia Gentleman"...!
The last time, Pakistan won against Industan.
I am not surprised that most of the Indians who put comments want to read and make comments only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, that shows good your mind.
It would be the same if they had qualified the India of the South Asia Gentleman...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistanian players participate, but having a Pakistanian version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a Pandore box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As regards the ISL, today's opening match was amazingly interesting, Kolkata's athletic was 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan has a lot of ways to do.
In comparison with billions and billions that India consacres to the IPL cricket and now on football, how can we rival once with our "bruying neighbors"...
The course to the low cost launcher is paying cash.
Damage for such a beautiful project.
For the accident, the possibility of design failure is only shown with a helium too cold.
So we may not be in a defect of design, but in exercise...
contrary to arianespace, which is a private company, it is well as soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own security.
Maybe they're gonna pay the satellites in frequency that knows.
This is so weaker that many media represent the only titles of articles - and that many readers only hold these titles.
In total, it creates a wrong impression contrary to the contents of the article itself.
In fact, in agreement with you, the title is not suitable, it makes the project injustice, while it is only a launcher problem.
