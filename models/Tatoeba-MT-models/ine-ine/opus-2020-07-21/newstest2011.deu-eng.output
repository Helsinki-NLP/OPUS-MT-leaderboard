What is it to do, the CSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Conditorium".
The new Council rulers of the capital of the CSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city's representation.
The newspaper currently.ch has been a little "absorpted" of the new Council members of the CSSD, as they have governed the notorial snow that has been involving in the last years in which the today's coalitions partners were in Prague at Ruder.
The coded word shadow, which was introduced by the Prague Political Elite in the decreased era of Master Pavel Bem, is rejected by some of the most of the acteurs, situations and cases.
It was surprised that the new rates related to these new terms were something in darkness.
They claimed that at least.
"Who's the Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am a newling in the Prague," reacted Luka Kaucky, the new adviser for culture, on the test of the "Paten-Wortschatz".
But also Mr Karel Brézina, a political veteran, responded similarly.
For example, the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present me here, which I'm going and use again."
Otherwise, I don't think much of snow.
From the wordcast that the daily sheet was published currently.ch in this year before the ODS election congress, the editing of six terms, especially those who are nottorially connected to Prager Magistrat.
The social democrats should define the terms "full-democracy", "greatest Prager Golfloch", "Go to the Conditorium", "Stiernacken", "Verrat of the Main City" and "Ball".
Three Prayers advised the trial that the fourth - Antonin Vinert, the future leader of Prager School - speaking first his participation in speaking, but not even listener.
The fifth adviser, Petr Dolininek, refused the test from before.
"I don't care about these things, and as the civil democracy interviews, I don't judge about it."
"For me, it is important how we understand in our programmes," he reported.
As mentioned already, Luka Kaucky would have not appeared to be recognized by the influenced undertaker and friend of the ex-meister, Roman Janoušek, the talk.
The term "Voldemort" doesn't say anything, and the only term he made correct at the test was "the biggest Prager Golfloch".
"That's the Tunnel Blanka," says Kaucky, but to be safe, "but I know it better from the magazine."
And funny, "I'll have to make a language course."
The Golfloch will then not only be determined by Matador Karel Brézina, but also by the Counsel for Environmental Questions Lukas Plachý as Tunnel Blanka.
But both social democrats know whose term is Voldemort and Luka Plachý even knows where this figure is to be found and what it means to go to the condition.
"I believe that it means to go into some Prager Gastronomy Operation," Plachy is quite close to the race solution if you know that it's about the seat of Janoušeks companies.
In accordance with Brezina, however, he emphasizes that these knowledge had already been created from the magazine than that he would have been his own.
It seems to be judged by the test participant that there is no similar shadow among the social democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call us on the name, go and again, we also use shortcuts or spitnames," says the president of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulininsky - of his partygenoses salopp "Hulda".
"In the school I was called Braza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues also call me like this," Karel Brezina delivers us his name.
The Zeitung Denik currently.ch has tested the name and see - he works.
Mr. Ratslav Vinert is friendly to the parties of the "opa" or less friendly of the "ancient", representative Miroslav Poche, who took attention to the elections by powers in the sponsoring of the party, is called by some colleagues "Igraček" (known Czech Lego-figure).
The names are the only one that allows social democrats in the internal language use.
Hulininsky does not appear to be called "Hulda", but Denik currently.cz registered another name of the Prager President.
His name "Doctor of the Gumminknûpel Rights" has reasoned to do that Petr Hulininský has made his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Policeakademie.
The Government wants to join the balls of "Hexen" and gave a brochure out
Women who are stumped in Burkina Faso to Hexen, usually show some common social characteristics.
They already belong to the elderly generation, they don't find any job - for example, for health reasons, they're free and have no children.
If one of these women are "vend", they will be strictly isolated so that they can't be able to make the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this shick room."
"And young and healthy women remain disappointed by helping them in the work and born children," described the situation in the main city of the Western African State Burkina Faso in a special home of more than one hundred women who have been issued by their communities.
The local government has now decided to fight these abnormal "social measures".
And there was a brochure for this reason to join the "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a hacken.
"More than 70% of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," indicated the magazine "the standard" to the dilemma of the written record.
However, the hexery is also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighborland of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahova was followed by three women and two men to die - they shot them with petroleum and simply burned them.
This event also reported the BBC server.
However, the teachers claimed that the thing would be just a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil is discovered, used for ritual salvings.
And even after the group tried to "extract a bad spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "hexen" is subjected to people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted to this a 42-year-old undertaking from Burkina Faso: "The human souls' freshers are earlier than today," he said.
As the Government in Burkina Faso at least tries to distort the Hexenjagd, the president of the President himself in the past year has agreed.
"President Yahya Jammeh deceived a monsterous Hexenjagd after his dead, because they had a part of their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To this, he called Shamane from near Guinea to help those who, in the execution of police, soldiers and the chairman's body, were unwillingly arrested women and men from the villages of the provinces and in the farm of the President in Canilai," the organization Amnesty International reported in its report.
On the farm, the inverse people were forced to drink a disorder from pf ́s with hallucine, which also caused darm and renal problems.
Two of the treated people did not survive the residence on the farm.
Only because of international pressure, the nearly thousand prisoners were released again.
A middleman of Bakala: Although he's inopen - yet he pays myths
An elderly deceived man just leaves the client range of the company RPG Byty of the "Cohlebarons" Zdenýk Bakala, the largest owner of meetings in Czechland.
Under the arm, a map with three new contracts to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who just sent a prison penalty.
All three were in the framework of the same. "Deregulation" just increased the middle.
Instead of 3500 crowns Monthweek, the son will be born for a 2 room apartment with a kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns in the next year.
"And there is not even a flowing warm water in the apartment, and you need to be heated in a simple coal shot," he suggests that he hurts the finger on the new bond of the son, to whose signature he has a full power.
"But what - I've signed," he explains half-to-do and half-resigned.
The civil union bytyOKD.cz, which included the new terms as "incorrect and immoral", advises the members to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, where they remember a guide to publicly as they are being made against such contracts.
But the man's just getting away.
"It says this, the other one," he makes a window view.
The region of Ostrava is the great "deregulation Labor".
After New Year, this deregulation is the most of the apartments in Czechland before they have no right-righteous duties.
Currently.cz has succeeded to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG Warteraum in Haviřov is one of the four in the Ostrava region and the nine hours tomorrow.
Besides the door, the bodyguards are a security agency and a call device.
"Mite 2011", so a special keypad on the touch.
Shortly appealed and the device has already exposed a number piece.
Sometimes we discovered the number "157" and already pick them on the large display at the cover of Wartera.
A half second later, you're on the row.
Something later, a older couple comes to the wartery to ask for the middle, but it is obvious that the wind in the wartery is not the new place.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair advice, insurance matters and similar.
Since middle November, the Covers with the new contracts are in the region of Ostrava, the majority of the municipalities of the total 44,000 apartments of the Portfolio of the RPG in the boxes of letters.
The RPG Byty proposes in writing an extension of approximately 15 to 38 Pro.
The special shield for the new meetings in the customer area has been opened since 18 November.
"The action is running something about a week, which means that it's just the beginning," the ladies behind the square answer after a moment when the "client" comes as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas earlier mountain work apartments are a brisante subject.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of the Parliament from Ostrava, Lubomir Zaorálek, from the CSSD, had taken this topic quite lauthally, no wonder that the newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor of them."
"WC-Brille couldn't switch them," it's the incoming man's increased air.
To this end, the employees are focused, especially on the scarlet, to convince whether they are actually obtaining the pronounced mixture that the RPG promises to them when they sign the special duration boat at the time.
In the satisfaction of one reduced February, the other members shall also be signed by the new contract until 15 December.
By now on, "Deregulation Shifter" is in Haviřov, but everything else than overloaded by requests.
"From the 360 greedy customers were only about 40 to 50 of the towns in 2011 for this reason," estimates the bills.
RPG offers individual meeting agreements, where necessary, both on their websites and on the wall tables.
If the parties do not find themselves at the new place, they will be established by an independent court.
"It must not be an incentive, but it is to understand the only possible and fully legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on his website.
"There is no one before the court," means one of RPG Byty's partners and a man on the street before the client's room gives you at least partly right.
"I've got 13,000 rounds, I'm left 5,000 for food, where I should take the money for a court fight," he says.
Then the employees will be uncertain.
"Let me see."
"Lord Zaorahek tells them about the media that they do not sign and that people are waiting for," they remind.
The regulated duty ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to the New Year 2011 and RPG Byty is a economic need.
"The existing height of the rents is not enough to maintain the residence fund," said Pavel Klimès, the director of the RPG Byty Apartment Portfolio Society, and - just the criticised degradation of the apartment fund is, according to the opinion of the home owners of the main reason for the creation.
Current RPG could invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, and in the four years of 2011 to 2014, it should be 5.2 billion.
On the large-formated LCD-display on the cover against the poultry-sessals in the Wartery of Haviřov, you always draw a few red lighting information.
"The mixture increases in 2011 by 15% and less about 31 200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means at least 7,50 CZK per square meter and month," it is read on the LCD monitor.
Only in 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the middle increases by 38%.
"In these cases, the increase of the exhaustive lower cost of 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG arguments.
At 2600 apartments the middle remains at the same height in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation of the feet is not spently to the height of three, but gradually within four and eight years.
Moreover - the company has another commitment: all income from the Middle East (see graph) would want the company to replace the apartments, especially in warm-seapers, in new windows and in the warmte.
But - primarily, these people will benefit those who sign the agreements on the assembly.
The architects saw a - to the office belongs to a child garden
The Building Aviopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would already expect a mini-kind garden here, with everything that belongs to: color-free walls, creative mobiles, a lot of game tools and even a mini-play on the outside.
This child garden has been available to the workers of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architectural office Arch.Design, from which the ateliers have a whole range of nominous burning buildings, was calculated by the first designs for the new Aviopoint building with the spaces for its business mining gardens.
In wise prospects, because most of his 90 workers (inside) are in the Babyboom Age and the company is able to return project anticipations and architects as quickly as possible to their workplace.
Along with the ability to work shortly, the child garden is another bonus, the Arch.Design has offered his employees in the concept of their social programme.
The buildings and architects have so easier to bring their appreciable professions and the children's forsorge under a hair.
The mini-kind garden is an original idea of the workers (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management of the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social for their project.
The operational mini-kind garden is financed by the operational programme for human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (advances of 2,8 million CZK) the necessary institutions and equipment were able to be acquired, and for the duration of 2 years, it is guaranteed for quality staff and for the operation.
After the creation of the awards (2 years) the Arch.Design is committed to continue to operate the mini-kinder garden for 3 years on its own costs.
The preparation of this project took a whole year of advantage, whereby the Economy Rating Company had a powerful assistance in the application development.
For children, they are very actively concerned about quality personal - a nurse and a child garden teacher, the child garden can visit children without older limits, although most of them are over three years old.
And as it comes to a mini-kind garden, only 5 children must be present at the same time, but they change the day over several children each other.
The child garden management is flexible to the needs of the parents, the children of all workers have the same rights in relation to the use of the child garden - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme contents in the mini-kind garden are comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
Children are not only playing here, especially for them is offered an excellent education - from basic knowledge to the pre-school education, and they also learn English.
The class room is not only with games and creative games but also equipped with a computer available to children.
More - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company million.
Parents can at any time cut a cup on the children and thus lose the stress when the children are late from a far remote child garden.
Therefore, parents use their worktime more productively.
There is no wonder that there are also natural and loyal workers' relationships.
Arch.Design has been defined in the Czech companies that provide clear benefits in the advertising of new employees that are family friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programmes.
A bone house is also fascinated after 100 years. See the interests of Gaudi
The dach encourages the back of a prehistorical eye, the steps like the wheel column of a dinosaur and the balcones are risen fish tables.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catholic Architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the neighbors, the house with its organic forms received the spot name "house of bones".
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stone, cocktails and mosaics, which advertising shapes and all-aspect lines, all these are typical characteristics for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fashion of the house is playing with traumatised lines, severe colors and textures that are reminded of nature and life.
First, in a more precise view, it is noted that everything will be controlled by geometries, rhythmus and throughout the order.
In the night, the whole fassade still acts plastic, dramatic and the special lights are still strengthening the graph of the colours.
The same wounding lines and shaded forms also govern the interior of the house.
Well-formed wood copys the window frames, lands, ticket elements of doors, even gucklocks and services.
The Batlló house in the fourth E ́mple on the beloved income street Passeig de Gracia No. 43 occurred by the rebuilding of a house from 1877, executed the architect Emily Sala Cortese.
The restructuring took two years in adjunction and was completed in 1906.
The investor, who is a major industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the decree of the old and building a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and even more balanced construction.
However, the Mietshouse Casa Batlló did not devote Antoni Gaudí alone.
He joined the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Just on his racebrot, the Decora for the representative apartment of the reality owner, and also the use of Mosaic on the Fasade was his idea.
However, there are many other artists and artists in the form of the fasade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudi.
So Jujol also participated in the building of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the Güell Park, where there are other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his finishing, the house received from the heavy inhabitants of his organic forms because of the name of the "nock house".
Others repeatedly called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "like house".
It is also said that all over the building is the worth of the holy george, the patron of Catalonia.
But more images symbolize the hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a single centralization system for the house for the time, with channels of dilution and typical rocks.
Something bizarre moves her 45-green neighborhood.
In the case of creation, Gaudí ignored follows all those building rules and did not allow them to be dismissed.
Before building, he received from the city the relevant building authorisation, but the information made by him about the planned restructuring was so weak that the citizens were so disappointed by the result that they requested resistance.
The Council rulers also agreed that the building with his arrows even entered the public citizens.
However, there were no changes, in contrast - only five days after the request of the city quarter, Joseph Batlló made a request for the approval of the two largest stocks of the house - and she was immediately granted to him.
The home owner himself entered the lower ethics.
In the gallery, in the second stone, there was a company salon, and in the stone there were sleep rooms and rooms of the apartment.
The earthquake was forgotten by a juwely business.
The whole six-style building runs a step up to the animal race.
By the basic elements of the construction, all right angles and right lines were removed and replaced by gay and shaded walls.
But Gaudi also with a modern concept of mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salons and thus a larger company could be able to be able to buy, without having to delay some intimity in the case of confidentiality.
The house also received a very unusual damage and two other stocks by Gaudís.
It is also impressive to Gaudis game with the light, as well as the blue and white glassed bottles with which the inner head is dressed and the lamps.
The game of these two colours provides all the ethics of the house a maximum light.
In this way, he made the Prince use that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight in contrast.
The Casa Batlló House, which was taken in 2005 in the Worlderbe List of Unesco, can visit everyone today.
In the first stock, the most nice and nice apartment of the public is made available.
The householders agreed only in the year to this step and this from the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a proper business, it was supported by the prospects, because it was also addressed to other common and the dach rooms, the animal race.
However, the price for building is not a paper style, which is 16,50 euros, students, renters, groups and inherents of tourist evidence is obtained by 20% reduction.
This amount exceeds the income prices to other Gaudí boats in the city.
Whoever wants to learn the real atmosphere of the house with his dragons, should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him home.
The right matrix and the right bed rose? Women have other desires than men
Not the most beautiful beds, but the quality of the lying area - so matrace and rose makes the bed out.
However, these must be added uniformly to be justified by the desires of the concrete user.
In the choice, many things play a role - the weight, size, health status, and not later the family of the sleeper.
It is also important for the interior in which maternity and rose have been subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not regularly heated, Latex matrates are not good enough because they need much longer to be "warm".
Moreover, they are clearly more difficult than normal polyurethan matrices.
And - they should be regularly won.
If they don't have enough dilution channels in the kernel and are still located on a fixed plate, it's the fuckingness: so it's not excluded that it's under her shield.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used.
Whoever was longer in the foreign, where very high matraces are usual with weight, it will be hard to usual to a lower matrix with hard surface.
"When all Eishockey players who have returned from the NHL, I'm deceived that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their divorced cups, freshes and cups, they simply need a wheel from Visco-shaum (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I also recommend that sugar diseases suffer under the nervous system, so that they may receive the "information" from the gender and skin badly," says Silva Hadamcziková, specialized on poultry mobs.
That's why I have taken care of many eishockey players ago, but also other customers with the Visco-schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no more problem, because such matraces offer the manufacturer of Tempure, the Italian Magniflex company or the Czech Manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't need to be a famous Eishockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco-scha.
This "wonder" works really easily.
The shadow optimizes its heavy and shape according to the absorbed warm, otherwise it regularly smiles on the warm body.
There's nowhere, in the night you're not walking like a hard fight.
You're just sleeping much better.
The viskoelastic shadow also offers protection from Dekubitus (Wundbrand).
When you choose the size of the mattress, you should still calculate the length of the footshalls to the body size, so about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like a woman who is big at the 180 cm needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the stairs should be available at least 90 cm width, so 180 cm together.
For individual beds, such as Singles, 120 to 140 cm are placed.
A half of the comfort, and also for possible sugars.
On the other hand, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on the back, it should be still enough space for the easily whispered arms," Ing. Helena Prokopová, the teammaster of the Polsters and roomus locators, which has already been spent for a year the problem of healthy sleep and the engineering of mobs, and this subject also offers to schools.
At a double bed, everyone takes a own rose and his own matrix, but cares for the incoming, so that the matraces also are the same high.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the rose in different heights and that is not longer possible for any bedtream.
Shadow matrates should be at least 14 cm high, matraces with a feed sheet of 15 cm, which should cover at least three centimeters of the form and the feed powder.
"By the hand or by the suspension, you can't check the feeds in case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each matrix requires a specific type of horse.
The entirely filled beds with matrace and substrate as the seamzwillings have nothing to look for in the sleep room.
These matraces can't weep and the reference can't weaken what is already running and giving today.
And since you lose in one single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l switch, it is clear that the matrate after five to seven years will be slow to a big (and hidden seb).
In addition, experts refuse to reject public logans, which promises a lifelong duration of up to 25 years, even long-term guarantee.
Everything has her Each and Bar.
Therefore, a practical advice of the operators: In mattress of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not strike the hygiene of the washable, distractable moves, however, it is recommended to use a matrace shone that can easily be cut off and wash.
Even if Matrix is usually produced with round rounds, so after opening two halfs (increasingly important for washing and washing machine size!), the manipulation with greater matraces, especially alone, is often like the inequality battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in the bed?
Get out of here!
Or at least for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
Moreover, they should be able to deal with the plate with the winds (if they are already inside) and use matraces with the feedsquelet and 15 cm minimum boxes with even wooden feeds and vineyard pools.
Polyurethan matrices do not belong to such a signature.
For non-producable late roasts of 14 to 18 feedbars (lamelines) are suitable Latex or Sandwichmatrates (e.g. Combined of Latex and Kokos), the roses are always used with a greater number of latests, so from 28 and more feedbars, with Lordosen in the landing area and the possibility of regulating the latin herds.
The manufacturable lamelet roses do not belong to the matrices with the Federskelet, because they do not respond to the ethnomic representation.
Besides the setting of the feed bars, special flexible wallet modules are also offered.
This is a specific confirmation of the feedbars that allows the feedbars to be printed or disturbed so that they can enable the pointal incidence of the traveller's wallets.
In particular, for men with wide pools, an important thing.
There are even matrace manufacturers who have started to use the wheel zones for the wheel area.
In addition to the ladies, you're thinking about these whistle zones in the coast.
For the most admissible customers, pointelastic flight feed systems (lattoflex) or roses with point-lastic contact paths, including multitortion feeding.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing spans.
But - if you use a bad (too large and low) heads for the right matrix and the right rose, most of the benefits will be lost again.
Here is also a rule of rubber: the heads are to lip the head, and its heads should only be reached up to the woods so that the rock muscles can be relaxed.
Ideal, therefore, appears a 50 x 60 cm of a big kissen, for example, as the scandainevier likes.
In the side layout, the head box (along with the wheel recharge zone in the wheel or the wheel zone in the mattrate) should compare the height of the wheel.
Something has our modern matraces with the unique (with heu ́tes) streams.
Modern manufacturers always use of common natural materials or at least their impressions.
Moreover, in matratzen, the new tuberculosis is called "Bio".
Instead of olive oils are used to produce polyuretanchaums of common natural oil - such as ricinus and sojale oil.
Soja is likely used by all manufacturers.
"Bio is called for matratzen, which is its nuclear from materials pure natural origin," Peter Vašíček explains of the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of matraces - one of the first was the Aloe Vera.
But you can also gain microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavendel dust when sleeping.
Also here you make a distinction between man and woman.
Currently, for men, a "coaling" pf’en extract of birds is used in order to absorb the heat and refresh the body, the concerns for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red papricascotes rain the blood circulation, so the weaker sex is warm when sleeping.
And the favorites today?
Matrates of calcium (he has greater pores with a severe cell structure and is therefore more atmosphere than commercial polyuretan and also much more flexible).
By combining the various staff (hearts) of calciums and visco-shoums, there are multi-zone matraces that know exactly where the head, the hair and the ferses are.
However, for a high-quality matrix, there are 7000 crowns and more.
However, health moderates are usually charged with lower additional tax, as they apply as medical assistance.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was assigned to this benefit.
It's not so easy to look at the matrace and the roast.
There are and again special offers of manufacturers and manufacturers who offer two matraces to the price of one.
Thus, the Magniflex mark offers the matratze Duofre face with the reference hidden Visco-schaum Mem日 for 11.990 CZK.
The second gets free of it.
It was the material temper that started the era of the vicoelastic shade materials with open cell structure and high depth in nearly cosmic temp.
No wonder, they were developed for the NASA because the astronautes have been exhausted at the start of great overloads.
The temperature is weakened in warmth, and in cold environment it is refreshing.
Thus it fits the human body perfectly and distributes the body pressure in optimal way.
It is therefore not just ideal to prevent pressure, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic smoking substances are not only used for matraces but also for other health products, such as for special footpools that are to facilitate the feet and the feet.
Home manufacturers, for example, use the sweam substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More parents want human monitoring devices to control the children
They are about their own children, and thus make more parents to monitor them by GPS.
The system, which is originally found for car rental, can also lead good people, which would be helpful in such cases as recently when the nine-year-old Anicca Janatková disappears.
The device is currently so large as a cigarette box, but it must not be soon greater than a armband.
The case of the disappeared Anicca has been put into fear and fear and thus keeps them on means and ways of looking for their children better.
In addition, for the price of an impact on their responsibility.
"We are trying to say to everyone that it doesn't matter with herum spies, but to reduce the probability of tragedy," Peter Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in some case, it can come to the misuse of such devices, for example, if you put it to someone without he knows it, but we haven't had any such case to deal with."
"The most customers actually buy it out of security reasons," f日 Pilin added.
See view should, however, always know what the "shachel" is to serve and how to use it in the emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočkova shows that if a child doesn't like such a thing, it simply seems to be deceived.
"And very small children show great creativity, if it is to lose certain things too, if they don't want to be controlled."
"The phones first wake up with the parents, but they can easily disable themselves like these new monitoring devices," said Mrs. Bočkova.
Your opinion is also restricted to whether such an installation in the case of an attack actually helps.
"When the Kidnapper is planned, the Kidnapper is practically always checking whether the child has any electronics with it, with which it can be broken."
"This is the phone today."
"If such monitoring devices find more useful, they would also look for them because their sale would be securely accompanied by massive publicity."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step forward," says the psychology.
However, it recognises that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a child’s side.
Roberta Chech followed by the Company RC Monitoring, which offers location services both for cars and for persons, can also help the existence of such a device if it is soon after the attack.
"The device is able to set up so that it reports the relevant position in certain interactions."
"And if it would be broken immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the driving devices, even a refreshment measure is integrated, which means falling and remaining unmotive, sends the device immediately a warning under the position specified," Mr. Czech said.
See Views of similar services can also make smart mobile phones with rubber, but it is only necessary to play a special software.
The problem of the current location devices is that it is either about devices in the size of street wood boxes, similar to the accents or smaller phones.
Always exists so that you lose them.
Accordingly, Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil is tested in the present devices that look like normal digital hours.
"This is the benefit that the potential driver does not need to recognize that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he knows what the police gives a time forward," he added.
Anyway, in which direction the development is going - to armbands or appealers, the same technology is always used in the area of vehicles.
So the combination from location function using the GPS system (as the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone reporting the current position.
The army has so many teeth snow that you can turn the whole Czechland, but you're only holding two years
The Czech Army has cooked 445 miles, burned with spendings.
In the previous year, the Defence Minister had delivered 224 miles of zinc to the arms.
It is already fair to know that the fighting forces have been issued for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of the bleeding - two, but at least four years.
The army purchased the tissue of the STV Group, etc. for 40 million crowns.
In its motivation for the acquisition of this violent quantity of zinks, the General Stab MF DNAES answered that the soldiers would consume the 60 miles per year.
Following the research of armed pyrotechnikers, MF DNES, this indication shows that the whole army should evaluate a very intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all the generals and officers of the Army Command, until the secretarys and puzzle women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Armageddon Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only so, the significant annual consumption of sixty miles of a half-way wheat was justified.
Moreover, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
However, these armed stocks would also have been held for more than → years.
However, if the old rule of experts applies that for the training of each new professional soldier, two meters of zinc, the army has been created through these new buyes - also under the point of view of the need of the Pioniers and Special Units - a sustainable preference for the 225 years already born.
In this case, soldiers of the fast income brigade recently were charged by the Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no patrons for hand-feeding weapons, so the shooting of the defective funds were strongly restricted.
The lack of the underhouse is completely weakened.
"I don't even understand why they buy such a lot of dark darkness from us."
But that's the last time their decision, they'll know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we want to find as a vendor largely," says the trade manager of the STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Defence Minister, has found the purchase of hundreds of miles of zinks with the army would have covered at least for a few years with this "munition".
However, Jan Decky from the STV Group only refers to a four-year use duration of the police and army pirotechniks for only two years.
"It is likely to be possible for perfect storage also for the four dead years," one of them who wants to remain unnamed to not be considered the criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the expiry of the consumption duration, any munition must be based on the test of whether it is still reliable and not acquiring the life of the soldiers.
But these tests are not unique, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Defence Ministry is the quantity process for the 445 miles.
"They costed us sixty per cent less than the aeroplane delivery of 244 miles," shared speaker Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Defence Minister.
Only for comparison: Annual consumption of pirotechnikers of the police, liquidation of munition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Armee has been over 1,500 meters for some years.
And the police always commands just such quantities of this munition that can consume it before the consumption duration is expired.
Moreover, because of the safety of the pyrotechniks, it is the possibility of flexible buying more modern and, therefore, confidential incense.
The Defence Ministry has no longer great problems in the liquidation of ten thousand tons of munitions from the time of the Warschauer Treaty, when the two hundred thousand buying Czechoslovakian peoples were prepared for their round to rain.
The Pyrotechnikers, who encouraged MF DNAES, expect the Czech fighting forces in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of miles of old tissues that she has so "build" today.
I'm going to see the contacts I've won from the competition until today.
Lucas Pytloun has helped Luke to sell his hotel's franchise.
The winner of the last year of the "Small Employer of the Year" competition became Luka Pytloun from Liberec.
His story of his success is like a film scenario.
Lucas Pytloun has a pleasure.
First in the foreign, he knew that in Liberec there were good overnight opportunities for reasonable prices.
From the exemptions of his holiday work in the foreign and with a bank credit he built a building house with five apartments.
If you think that he was a student in the sixth semester at that time, this was certainly a courageous arrest.
"The price-quality related to me, and so I tried to take something against it," says Luke Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment, he avoided foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the wins in the house, which he then moved to pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in only seven years of undertaking activity in Liberec, there were four pensions, two silent restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all categories of residence.
The most comfortable of them was the fourth hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
In this year, another classic hotel arrived.
"We've already signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we've exhausted our Franchise concept and other interested people in the Pytloun hotels have already been reported," says the undertaking number One of the past year.
"A large part of this license return to the exploitation of hotels had just the winning in the competition "the Employer of the Year" and Mr. Pytloun was recognized.
The victory has made him more known, so popularity in Liberec and environment.
"The people recognized me on the street, they often welcomed me even nightly and I must say that it did right," he reminds.
I really recommend to share in this competition all who want to create something.
You don't even have to win, every visibility is good.
He says that he has benefited from the contacts and knowledge until today, which would not have come to any other part.
"As some of the people I have met with the competition, I will discuss regular business relations until today."
The honour associated with the success is also a little lower to each of his employees.
And there is the seventy.
"I note more loyalty and confidence to them that they are part of something that will be granted to the general recognition."
I really view this as not only as personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just embraced in front," says Luka Pytloun.
I want my followers a more strict year when we had it in farm.
The seuphory was quickly solved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal effort, Farmet has the worst back.
The price for the first range of the Competition of Wodafone Company of the year last year took Karel Zdžárský, the company of Farmet.
The Jury appreciated at that time the efforts he made from the small tool building in Czeska Skalice a company from the ground that makes hundreds of millions of turns.
"I can say that this appreciation is not only myself but also encouraged all my workers and strengthened our self-consciousness in combating competition," says the preceding winner.
At the beginning of the pharmaceutical history, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the State’s father Karel Žďárský as a compensation for the property undertaken by the communists, he offered a small workplace for pact, he did not long, he left his car in the company where he was busy, saused and founded with a few cameras of his father's own company for the manufacture of plastic waters.
Shortly later, they began to concur on pf oil pressures.
Age 18, they have increased to the highest auto-prise manufacturer throughout the Mediterranean.
But only through the success of the competition and its mediation, it has also been aware of the non-publicity.
"Not just that our customers consider the Mark Farmet clearly more intense now, our foreign partners also started to cooperate with a company that has made the greatest success in their country to meet a greater value," says Karel Zzhársky.
However, the past year was not only in the sign of the seaphory.
The assessment resulted from the economic results of the company in 2008 and a part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products.
The crisis that at that time was less than the citizens, but especially the company, just reached their highest point - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and prevent the introduction of new institutions and technologies.
"No, of course, we couldn't get out of this situation."
"The borders went back to 40 Pro, we had to restrict the production and even to take the exhibitions," Karel Žjárský said
A living undertaking must also take such unfair measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation in the head and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with less profits than before the crisis.
One of the companies was not willing to distort - investment in research and development.
"From the subsidiarity we build a research and training area, strengthening our presentation on international mixtures and accommodation of main prices in domestic exhibitions," says Zdjararsky.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
The areas grow again and with them the number of new workers.
"The new victor I want a lot of pleasure in the vig - but in a stronger atmosphere," Karel Zzhársky adjusts.
A question of opinion that clears the rules set out with us
The opinion on the "absurdity of the year" is the fourth part of the undertaking legislation.
Some of our rules have already been created from the world.
For doubtful winners of the next year of the "Afkursity of the Year" opinion, the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
Thus, more than one third of no more than four thousand voting undertakers.
The social insurance manager so requested a paper output from the trade manager, even if the officer could have received it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the question of opinion, this changes now.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will in the future no longer require exemptions from the Commercial Governor," said the Chairman of CSSZ Jana Buranňová.
The meaning and purpose of the opinion "Absurdity of the Year" is to take all rules and arrangements under the lupe, to comply with the undertakers in Czechland and to resurrect us.
This is already the fourth part of an undertaking legislation which is composed of the economic period (HN) and is enjoyed in the public increasing population.
When in the last year the three thousand votes were shared in the vote, there were four thousand in this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that are unique and only to prevent business activities.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a first range in the world," Karel Havlikek notes from the association of small and medium-term companies and trade operators of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the undertaking activities is the proclaimed goal of all governments in the last years.
However, in comparison to the world, the situation in Czechland has not been discouraged.
According to the World Bank's information, the Czech Republic takes the 74th account, compared to the previous year an eightth places of worse position.
The competition was first called in the year and plays each year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic uncertainty from April to the end of September.
To log in, the website www.firmaroku.cz will be used for seven candidates for the "Antiprise" and allows the public to vote on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.cz.
It sees the absurdity that receives most of the votes.
In this year, more than 100 opinions have been reported, more precisely 105 without sensible rules and arrangements.
The tips are not only of undertakers but also of professional associates and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, there are provisions that holding vehicles for carrying and traveling roads have to be locked or that undertakers with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare each two years.
The list of "Seven" this year is published on the sides of the competition.
The vocation of competition at the beginning of November, on the Prager Wenzels, is part of a happening, which regularly shares the personalities of the political and public life.
In this year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Liaison of Small or Mediterranean Company and Competitive Manufacturers of the Republic of Tsch. and Petr Kužel, President of the Commercial Chamber of the Republic at the highest point of competition with the party.
"When the State holds the boat between the feet, there can be no real economic creation, therefore it is my goal to set up at least 30 paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessary to the undertakers," shared Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industrie and Commerce.
The efforts to create us from the world show effect.
In 2007, the people were able to report the obligation of the undertaking to the holder at the place of their continuous operational stage three days in front of the purpose of conducting an exhibition status or Kirmes.
This obligation has been rejected by a Novelle of the Law.
The obligation that 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the obligation to report to the Working Board Service Travels of Employers for up to 30 days - was also denied by the Law about them. "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absorption of 2009, the regulation, which introduced physiotherapeutes, was chosen to have a spike, a cold disease and two persons' wages in the speech room.
This Regulation has been middled by the Ministry of Health in this year in some ways - the obligation of refrigerating has fallen.
A new category worth socially responsibility companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sport projects
A newness in this year's fifth year of the economic period's competition (HN) is the category "A responsible company of 2010".
The basis of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertakings.
"We want to undertake such companies that are conscious of the impact of your undertaking activities on the environment and under socially responsibility initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, the caller and guaranteed of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For this year the first year of this special subcategorie of Vodafon Company was reported to companies for which the success was not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is extremely inspired and bad enough substance for an independent article.
Though they distinguish the subject of their activities diameterly, their efforts have a common denominator support and monitoring.
For example, this is about handicaped people, because personal problems or health of their own workers.
For example, among the four finalists from the whole Czech Republic, the Prager Software Company Et Netera, which promotes non-formal sport teams among their employees who then share in numerous tourners in different sports types.
Another example of a responsibility company from the Region Pardubice is the Isolit-Bravo company, which is already seven years old as the main sponsor of the establishment fund for handicaped children.
A paper manufacture from Poděbrady, for example, takes care of their healthyly sustained employees, which make 70% of their employees, for which it was approved by the title "The Competitive Company of the Region of Mediterranean"; in the Competition of Wodafone Company of the Year, it was determined in the framework of this region.
In the Olomo region, the MiRyz Soft booking firm, which also introduced a flexible and average 35 hours a weekly reduction of worktime, and that without proportional loan reduction.
The Jury also honored the condition that the company is primarily involved in Czech producers, supported citizens in their environment and supported environmental principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to maintain the effects of our undertaking activity and employment for the environment as far as possible," explains its business leader Milusse Ryznarová.
The responsible IT enterprise Enlogit from the Region Usti na Labem is again located in the health of its employees and thus has created them to all the notebooks ethnic sexs and keyboards, and also encourages them to use cartering services offered by a home-related workplace.
"In addition, we submit the establishment "Men in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the modern Roma community," says Ondrej Searchy, the representative of the company.
It is not recently valuable to be the A of the purification of the "Pranní a purshaní" of the Karlsbader region, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We give our employees contributions to the commitment, to the road of work, to increase their qualification and to the vacation," Joseph Straßèch says from the Buffirma Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Marine-Schelean region.
At the category of the year's responsibility company, all of the branch officers of the Competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically reported, answering the questions of the questionbook submitted by the notice and checking it at the latest until 15 August.
False or incomplete answers in the questionbook have been excluded from the assessment.
"If the representatives of the legal firms have not answered the questions, they have been excluded from the competition of the "responsibility firm of the year", in the Vodafone Society of the year, but they have not been disqualiified."
"A separate notice on this competition is not possible because it is only a sub-categorie of the main law firm of the year," Karel Goldman states by the acting agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Boden Funds - Police arrests in a public statement
In the building of the ground fund in pilses, the anti-corruption police took place in the last days of arrests.
In this context, the home media operator and the immobilious operator Luboš G. was carried out by the detectives in hand cells.
It was aware that it was attempted to manipulate a just eligible public competition for the development of restitutional refunds so that the basic elements offered in the competition would satisfy a particular interester.
This would have paid Luboš G. a half million for it.
"To this time, I can only see that the police follows a person in a public competition due to the delict of detrimental powers," said Antonie Zelená, the leader of the Pilsner State Advocate of the magazine "Pravo", could not provide more details in relation to the current investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year undertaking was released from the police.
In the way he could manipulate the public competition, it is only possible to speculate on the basis of special official information.
The speaker of the Boden Fund Lubomir Černá led to the question of Pravo, which the police has actually taken arrests in the Board Fund's headquarters and this during a public competition.
"It was about a customer and meditation about one of our employees," she concretized.
According to the public competition, Mrs. Cherná had the correct term "Request for the submission of claims to transfer baselines in accordance with the ground law" and would have been placed in cases where several applicants were interested in the proposed baseline.
"These persons, within the framework of the request, offer a strict value of their compensation requests to be compared with the transfer, as the basic value called."
"In accordance with the proposed advice, the order of potential purchasers shall be set, then the ground fund transfers the foundation to the person with the maximum boat," explains the Fund's speaker.
Luboš G. was obviously available to information who had been reported to the request and since he was self-bearing person, since he had covered a number of restitutional applications, he invited a basic interest to return from the competition.
Obviously against a fat delay.
This would also be a sufficient clothing for the reason why he had a great amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had already been contacted with the Pilsner Boden Funds in the past.
Thus, he also played a role in the case of the former head of the Battery Fund Václav Sankota, which was criminally persecuted because he issued baselines in replacement restitutions to which the positions had already been deemed to build.
At that time, Luboš G., for example, removed from the ground fund, as well as basic pieces designed for the building of public roads, in the place where the building of the travel magistrale was planned to the area of Borské pole.
Later, he put these very favorable with the Magistrat against a house directly in the historical centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the basic pieces.
At that time, the rathaus had to give a small heart in order to not make the building adequate by blocking the basic pieces.
The residence of the households increases about some hundreds a monthly
The budgets must not only calculate the costs of all energy species since January, but also with water- and waste supplys, and also grow for remote heat and some places.
Family members have to take more from the Portemonnaia than until January.
Strom will be to 4,6 Pro ́ more tourer, gas by 2 Pro ́ and more, in some cities you will need to swallow up to a decade more for water supplys, and some places also protect the remote heat supply.
Only the energy charge costs a few hundred crowns each year.
The prices were reduced by all major suppliers, thus the clear promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, particularly from photographs.
Although gas will only be modered, this is exactly when people need to hide most of them and have the maximum consumption.
So here is also to be calculated with some hundred crowns more per year.
Current power and gas will be more valuable in the whole Czech Republic, and the prices for telecommunications from town to city are different.
In particular, price increases are planned in larger places.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more than 1,000 crowns per year from January for remote warmth to month to 50 crowns, pay more than 1,000 dollars per year in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague returned to 9% of water and waste, and this is the case that the city increases the infrastructure.
If the middle doesn't change, it's only 6,8 Pro.
However, the price in Prague, compared to the whole Czech Republic, continues to be the lowest.
In the north woods, where the prices are now part of the highest, water and waste driving will increase by 7.4 pro.
For example, a huge price increase is to be expected in 140,000 conference apartments, where the middle regulation is also fallen from January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which plants 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, which is a hundred pro ́s age from January.
Those who do not agree with this mixture want the company to be worth interested.
The regular meetings, which are still paying in nearly 300,000 apartments today, have to increase in more than 10 pro.
Czech kids strike with telenet and Rum Bier is out - it simply works too slow
Fernet, Rom and Wodka, exceptionally a good whisky that you have shot the father out of the houseboat.
These are the beverages whose drinks of the Czech teenagers are to be not treated at least five often.
There is no exception to children who have to sleep in the hospital again.
This results from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the record of children's clinical divisions.
"Bir or wine are completely out of the face, because it's just too long until you're drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Pravo Ludék Pelikán, the Chefar of the Child Division in the Medium Clinic Hořo.
"Whisky, if it's easy to remove the father a flash from the household, and if not, then at least telenet or Wodka.
"Wodka has the benefit that you can meet him with Juice, then he doesn't ride so strong," explains the Chefar.
The speaker of the Motol Eva Jurinová’s school hospitals gives him the right.
"The most often is about telenet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in basic schools."
"Included it was also about Slibowitz to be accepted from home," Mrs. Jurinová advised.
According to Chefar ́ Pelikán, three or four-year drinkers in the hospital receipt are no longer an exception.
Before the clinic in Hořo, in which he had been used since this year, he was employed in the Padiatrie Department of the Hospital Motol, where students from Nah and remote drinking cars were delivered.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your kare started with 12 years when she was first given with 3,5 Promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "Extase"," the Ar described a particularly serious case.
"It was in Holesso's exhibition campaign on somebody's danzparty."
"The interesting thing was that her mother wasn't surprised that her daughter didn't come home 48 hours," the Chefar wondered.
If the unbelieving interest of parents or their incredible tolerance is used in the case of their own speakers as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
For a real dependence in the true sense of the word, experts do not follow in children.
"Unless alcoholism is a long-year chronic dependency on alcohol and all the phenomenon associated with it, and this is not the case for these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol is a negative social background characteristic, “Chefar日 Pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital Motol, Mrs. Jurinová, was introduced in the yesterday division for children and youth medicine until middle November.
Nevertheless, only the cases with serious alcohol injury that made a hospital residence needed are included in the statistics.
Being children who are brought home after ambulant treatment by parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
Besides the cases in which children blow just a flash in the school bank, there are three annual ambitions, which are a hundred-procently left: Walpurgis night, silvester and the end of the school year.
"There is called for two reasons - or from a cup because of a bad testimony or from a pleasure to the flights."
"In the Walpurgis night, I have also received seven drinking children once in the record," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drinking kid that takes the night under his guard is paradoxally better than a child who has only struggled with an unappreciated catcher on the next day.
The head pain on the morning, which causes dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be exhausted in the hospital with a fluid infusion with glucose and nutrients that feed the organism.
"They are obviously better doing, because after the "hearly" experience of the evening, they wake up with good pleasure without doing anything worse."
"You're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán invoke, while he's at least disgusting the patients with the Laune by counting them the costs she'll cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the safe car and the night in a acute bed comes well and pleases a couple of thousand crowns.
"He and again, I used this as educational means when I directly predicted the children at the visit what has done their drinking and that it can make sure that they have to work over all the flights to deserve the money for one such feet," he added Dr. Pelikán.
However, the hospitals do not consider the regressive procedures to request the costs necessary for the children of drinking.
Two training aircraft L-159 first in foreign hand - in Spain
Two easily aircrafts L-159 of the total five, who have exchanged the Czech Republic of Defence against Transport Airport Casa C-295M, are held on Sunday in the Spanish city Sevilla, where the Spanish Airporter Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time that the machines of this guy are in possession of a foreign army.
In the outerland, they were only to see at Manövern or Airports.
This concerns the flying two-seed version L-159T1, which was carried out by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircrafts are unique L-159.
These are still conserved in Aero Vodochody, the host of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken her last week.
When she sends the flights physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek is not yet followed by the speaker of the Defence Minister.
The combined campaign L-159 was re-employed from long-term aircraft, which is without further investment and investment from the resource of the Ministry.
"The dual seats L-159T1 were currently exchanged in the state and appearance," said Pejšek in the magazine Pravo.
He adds that the army will not have to come out without two-seen camping aircraft, since the Defence Ministerial Ministry in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody signed a 200-million contract on the construction of four overflow L-159 to the two-seen version.
A new aircraft took the army in July, the second wants to take it until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, the EADS has committed to implement the campaigns in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the Treaty, it is clearly stated that EADS is the beneficiary of the aircraft L-159 and that they are to serve for the training of pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is therefore the thing of the recipient, in what way he realizes the thing," Pejschek led.
The economic period (HN) had also reported that the Spanish Government does not have interest in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the acquisition of other aircrafts for 3.5 billion crowns was adopted by the Government of Mirek Topolánek in the past year.
The Defence Ministry had then not issued a statement procedure, but said EADS directly.
The final Defence Country argumented that this exchange will submit to the future export of L-159 to foreign.
The Czech Army bought Aero 72 machines, from which it only used 24, who wanted to express it.
Moreover, the acquisition of the Casa aircraft should have a judiciary.
The European Commission claimed that the Czech Defence Minister is at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken three aircraft Casa, the last will be in the airport Kbely within four-year days.
A longer indicator finger than ring finger means a lower risk to bleed cancer
Men whose point finger is longer than the ring finger, are obviously a lower risk to decrease prostatac rabs.
This is the surprising result of a middleweek published by British Journal of Cancer.
This must be associated with the mirror of the man's hormone testosteron.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostatakrebs, and this is particularly in men to 60," explained the med > Rose Eeles, Professor in the Cancer Research Institute at Warwick University.
The finger could be helped to determine which men should, in fact, undertake a prostataxreb test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors, such as health charges, such as ladies Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with prostatac rabbis, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
More than the help of the participants of the area was the pointer of the right hand less than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostatake rabs, as for 19% of those men whose rings and show fingers were equally long.
But in men whose ring finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk was 33 per cent, in men up to 60 per cent.
The proportion of the length of the two wounded fingers, which are already represented in the prenatal age, obviously reflects the different speeds of sex hormones which the child was exhibited in the birth mother.
Less testosteron corresponds to a longer indicator finger.
Earlier research showed that the testosteron just clears the growth of prostatac ribs.
Václav Pačes, leader of the Czech Genetic and former president of the Academy of the chairman, said that he would be flexible to him, but he kept the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk until now not shown for "v ́awful".

The travelers should be informed of the current situation.
Airport Russia has been closed from middle of 11 hours to 5 hours tomorrow.
Most of the streets in the South Sea are only driving with higher prospects.
For Vyskov, three nearways are completely uncontrolled, in the surrounding of Brno are apparently snow movements and in the surrounding of Blansko you are forced to use snow streets on some placed streets.
One of the most concerned areas is Výskov.
Three roads are still locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milecho.
Moreover, you need to use snow-freshes for snow space.
When they are driving back, they can't be evaluated until now.
In the region of Hodonin, the white carpats are indicated in the area.
On the roads that can be stretched only from natural protection reasons with incircumcised streams, there is up to five centimeters of dick snow, leading to the CTK.
In Czechland, two to ≥ centimeters of newsnew fell, most of the northern beaches - mostly up to 18 centimeters.
In the marine-Schelean region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
In Czechland, however, it's quiet to stop snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapons".
In Afghanistan, the groups have first used a new "intelligent" weapons, which are only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon affects the dance conflict with the Taliban and the power relative to their benefits.
The new weapon is something like a superground canon.
Their projects are, in fact, broken by Laser with a match security of only a few meters to the goal.
The special choices of caliber 25 mm, developed for this weight and contained high-explosive spray, work practically as small granates.
The choices can be scheduled so that they can explode not only on the scope, but at a particular point of their balistic flight.
That means, you can use it against an enemy who is standing behind a barrier - a wall or in the grave.
From above, it is usually not sharp, so the murderous steel splitting lines from above can easily put it out of war.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new warfare is the first infantry weapons that make use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is in principle: he shows the goal and sends a laser rail which determines the distance, so he wins a precise view point after which he corrects the growing angle, then he just needs to press.
"Let's say, you have 543 m."
"When you go away, the weapon is up and shoot the choss to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
Decreasing 400 workspaces
The Concern Fujitsu lays his delay in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July Next year, 400 employees will place their job from the former Bürobader building at the Marienbader place in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese Concern Fujitsu reduces his delay in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the specialized branchenries in the middle-week reported on the computer and their storage, in July next year, 400 women and men will be placed their job from the former big building in the Marienbader place in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a big office complex on the Lions Street in Frankfurt City Nederrad.
A speaker of Fujitsu said that in the middle-term, there should be 100 other workplaces of the concern, which have been distributed to the region.
The meeting offer was extremely attractive, and the large room offices in the Astro Park were better faced with the work of the workers.
Furthermore in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a mieter.
The competent business leader Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central location with excellent infrastructure with Frankfurt-Nederrad."
The exceptional connection to the aircraft is just for a global company such as Fujitsu of great importance.
The new movement of an important enterprise within the region showed joy in winners and losers last night.
Frankfurter Economic Dezerner Markus Frank (CDU) said that a global player was won again.
It's a "great location notice".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the occupation is an important impulse for nederrad.
The Bad Homburger Oberburger Master Michael Korwisi (The Green) suffered the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the business guide on the purpose.
"We have certainly offered our help to the company," Corwisi said.
However, friendly contacts would not have been able to change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the immobilious resident at the seabader.
Lately, economic reasons would have made the exemption.
Now it's going to prevent a long space at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and the owner of the building is working."
The house used by Fujitsu until now at the rash and the neighborhood "Small verticals" belonged to the rest of the buildings at the seabader space ­ years ago to the most enveloped buildings of the Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, there was a new city centre between Bahnhof and Rathaus, which also provided a massive building of the areas used before as a parking place and the height of the buildings for criticism.
2001: the investment consultation and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel systems, start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu the homes that are connected to Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was made by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilie-Chancen Group in 2006 with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and continued a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu conveyers in Tokio are the largest IT providers of the world.
He provides firms, for example, computers and servers and provides the necessary service.
The reduction in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, yet more employees count Fujitsu in München.
From Bad Homburg, the daughter company Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Nederrad, which other daughters in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a TDS company.
For this purpose, Astro Park was mixed 7000 square meters in the Büro.
In the twenty-year-old complex, the name is playing on its star-formed basic risk, including the central band of electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon locks server - Drives against Assange
Wikileaks are hardly in trouble.
The internet service officer Amazon has declined the enth-service platform from his servers.
Perhaps the political pressure has been published after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomates.
Wikileaks green Assange appears to stay in England.
The Wikileaks enth’s enth’s platform is always stronger in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous Ananian server and now search for a Internet home in Europe.
The prominent senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to boykott of Wikileaks.
And the Wikileaks greener Julian Assange, located on Interpol's category, will be stopped after a magazine report in the United Kingdom.
"Wikileaks of Amazon---streamed."
"Free talks in the country of freedoms," the enth-up activists shared Twitter at the midweek (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet enterprise Amazon forbidd the Wikileaks documents from his servers.
The Internet activists had returned to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) during the publication of the secret diplomatic depths to allow high access numbers to documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks continued to say, "Prima - ours are now issued to work people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom, "they would have stopped to overcome books."
Amazon has cut off the use of his server by Wikileaks after the workers of Senator Joe Lieberman's investigations, the TV CNN reported in vocation to the office of Loverman's office.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee for Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boykott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take this action before, in view of the previous publications of classic information through Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Liverman therefore urged the platform to delay the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unmarried and unconscious action sets our national security on the game and guards around the world's life," it is called in a communication of the partial senator.
"No responsible company - whether ananic or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to broadcast the coated material."
Wikileaks-green Assange, seeking the authorities in Switzerland because of the disabilities, is found in the Interpol's category.
According to a report of the London magazine "The Index" the 39-year-year-old in Greece, which is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always understood the investigations in Sweden as an intrigue of his enemies.
Wikileaks speaker Christinn Hrafnsson said in London, it has given advice.
"There was even a call after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why fearing ascense rightly for his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks greenhouse will therefore continue to be hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had requested the responsibility for the Wikileaks enthries to be accused and charged.
In Canada, a Governing Boss Stephen Harper's adviser said - obviously ironic - in television, assange should be killed, and Obama could "use a dress".
There was a shift between the white house and the assange.
The speaker of the President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "laughing and absurd" that Assange had requested the return of the foreign minister Hillary Clinton if it was responsible for the latest requests of spionage to diplomates.
"I'm not sure why we're concerned about the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The Government of the Ananias now provides the protection of its databases at the level of the test.
As a special officer, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror measures, which was called Travers, shared the white house.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which were necessary after the publication of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways the whole government exchanges and slips information.
The Government also urged to ensure the security of dissidents and assets, they should be invoked by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything to contact them," said foreign speaker Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to get them out if it should be necessary."
The Ice University
The "Gelato" in Bologna is prepared for better years.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiaries has the largest running and surgery from the world.
Where does the whole iron come from?
From the lottery and the gelataio.
The latter, in Germany, some old eyecondator, represents the creme according to all the rules of the Italian ice master art.
The gelataio takes the icecreme out of the coal, stretchs it into the weapons and then swallows it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he doesn't come to the "Gelato University" of the Italian Carpigiani company.
The ice university has established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice creme from its machines will be justified by the high Italian ideas.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiaries has the largest running and suppers from all the world.
But there are also several days of special courses around chocolate and practice in the householding iron.
Some dream in the middlelife crisis from a new car, others simply swim on the glass of iron of their wallets.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, artists from California, lie日 the Slow Food movement and want to offer a quality product in the country of the Ice Cream industry.
Anke from Berlin is the company's rate and wants to enter something in a nervous work after years.
Two young Egyptians dream about opening a railway in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one of Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice creme in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice creme.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect icecreme.
It is decided not only to be a good shame, but also the strict threat and consistency.
But in his training, Luciano does not forget the national and generally southern overseer: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then every number of romantics is still there."
The first step to manufacture seems very easy.
Luciano kips the base-related milk, sahne, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixed device, which produces all to 85 degrees with a electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a hair on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white basecreme, base for all milk.
Soon the Do^ will be warmed with questions: Can Icecreme only be produced with natural substances without stabilisator?
How can you leave your own experimental loss free?
Luciano warns to lead to the error from the time of the spirit.
He who speaks of Eiscreme "only from natural additives" has probably used stabilisers - mostly a natural product, such as warker meat from the guarbohne.
Of course, you can also manufacture iron without stabilisator, just then it must be crossed within one day, otherwise, and the customer works on la ́ Eiskörnchen.
Some variations in the basic mass are allowed.
It's going to be more spending with the aromes.
Master Luciano is different from the additives that are buying in the fruit-section or in the super-equipments.
Moreover, there are powder and pastures.
"The suppliers are all trying to turn you to dozens of aromatized additives."
"But you should just experiment once."
Or in the fruitsorbeds with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even at the icecreme from the white basic mass, which becomes with eggs to yellow creme and with cacaopulver based on all possible chocolate transfers.
Now the currency participants can be in the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to manufacture four different types of vanille, chocolate, mokka and hazel iron - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also be understood by the fruits.
More aromatic substances, more fruit-powder - sorrowful it is not absolutely better.
Hasel ́s ice doesn't sow more nutrient if it contains more hazards.
The most popular Kiwi is the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilisator.
Only one exhausted mixture highlights the shadow of a gelato right, says Luciano.
Ice creation is an accounting task: If Pfirsich birds are used with a lot of sugar, the sugar part must be reduced in the basic receipt.
For citroneneis, an extraportion of sugar is needed.
Luciano shows a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruits (Winzer measures the oechsle in the treemost).
Fortunately, tables easily easier the computer.
Iron to make no longer requires so many physical uses as before.
Not only helps the device for the automatic manufacture of the basic mass.
There is also a device where the complete iron mixture is coated simultaneously and is coated at minus temperatures.
Yet, all automatization remains no small pawns.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his colleagues are drawn down from above to below with fresh gates, when the overdimensional stab mixer is made to him without control.
"In any course," said Maestro Luciano, "is just a question of the time until something like this."
Doublelight controllers
The Ephesus related to food is subject to the experimenting industry with genetics.
This proposal now forms the test biotech group, which understands as an independent institution for the bio-evaluation of the impact.
"It sounds like a deterioration theory, but we have documented it well," said the testbiotech chief Christoph Then middleweek in München.
The leader of the Ephsa expert group for geneticly modified PF, Harry Kuiper, and another efsa expert has been under the contract for years.
It is paid by concerns such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has appropriately joined the efsa test rules for Genpepenen and then stands in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The provisions of the Efsa shall be adequately equipped with the position papers of the Illi and thus take the handbook of the industry to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that the test biotech has misleaded an interest choice.
Thus, a high-range Efsa manager is younger without a record or a transition time to the Swedish farmer Syngenta - and thus has changed the pages.
In addition, the Mediterranean (MDR) had recently enthusiased personal connections between EU auditors and industrial obby, as well as EU parliamentaries.
Instead, the EFSA cannot recognize interest conflicts.
All serious data, including those of the industry, are replaced as long as they are of higher fair quality, are set out in a opinion.
The experts who work for Ephesus do not want that they don't have any contacts with the industry.
They should have opened them.
Kuiper frees his work for the International Life Science Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
Thisself is used as a neutral forum for experts from economy, industry and Property, including to evaluate risks for bioassets without lobby.
In this matter, independent experts, such as the fact that nationally modified pfs are currently allowed without any feeding trial in animals and that the response of Geneva on environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, makes geneticly modified meat on the ground," then says.
Current practice is, only isolated proteins, but not testing the whole genetic, which does not provide any lossful results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how to find them then?", he's asking.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck looks like.
Since 1994, the researcher has been investigated in the genetic technology and has currently been employed at the Technical High School Zürich.
In this area, as in the United States, the industry is trying to influence or discreet critical economies in Europe.
That is why there are no researchers who are not blown with concerns.
It would normally not be critical for companies.
"The industry controls the safety research," he says Hilbeck.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell also cared about what, totally about 400 kilo.
At Montague he was the form of Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It's crazy.
The story is: In September the baggers were attacked and began to break a large part of the northern flight.
The Stuttgarter World was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-target depth of the bathroom.
When it came to the building up, a large part of the flight was in shoes.
Broke in 6000, 7000 pieces.
\ilsheimer Muschelkalk, a low gross stone, surprised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is an imagehouer in East Fields, 43 years old.
He safeguarded some of the brockens.
"These stones are relicians."
"You can't go away."
He swears, "A billig and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he told one, he went to cigaretesqualm.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the brokens.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The track of the Stuttgarter Steine leads to a forest in Tubbingen to an ancient Munition Depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has created his stone-regime.
The 44-year-old works with old stones.
He cooked all those who were inside the abris in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be weakened to shotters or disappeared in the depone," he says in ́Office, a woodbow, who was a guardian once.
He was injured and threatened, he said, when in September he was in the magazines that he bought the rest of the north flight by the breaking undertaking.
But he talked to the S-21-G.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the abris.
And if it happens, then it's the most reasonable if the stones were continually used.
Approximately 200 S-21-G ́r took one of the severe squares in the range of 80 kilo, the price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As other men, some, but also in the hope of rebuilding him.
500 tonnes had bought rounds, 25 big Lkw loads.
About the help is still stored in the forest, which has been longer spent.
Gardens owners, landscape farmers, home-level builders.
They were coming from everywhere and had lost what coffee space and attachments could be.
The Stuttgarter stone of the stomach have long been converted into "maurle" or to restrictions of cross beach.
"In fact, this stone is nothing worth," says Rongen.
"It wouldn't be the political component."
He goes into his landing car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of a great kingdom.
Jura has studied and cancelled, later biology, then he has been interested in computers and has become stone handlers.
And Steinliebhaber.
40,000 tons of stone is stored there.
From all Germany, he carries his shoes together.
He says he's the largest Altstein handler of the Republic.
It's fast.
In the snow, there are artificially stumbled sandstone.
"They belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, heavy.
"My Lieblingsstein."
It's going through the forest.
He shows on a hole: red sandstone, former part of the Karlsruher bathroomhof.
And go on.
"Syner Travertin."
Once the quarters belonged to the tribe of the Stuttgart Neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow stone and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Presidency, Red Granit from the Dom Sankt Blasia, Tuff from the healthy hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweet.
When the rings think about how the stones were stuck by hand and were moved with simple flashing and oxen cars, it will be honest.
"It'd be a scandal if you'd hurt something like that."
Rich hasn't become, no rock anymore.
But 14 people are employed by the stone-handleer today, and have left up in the woods of stones, a smied, a glass-blazer, and a garden-building.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the reverent.
He's got to go to Köln.
There are also stones to save.
Talent fighting high potentials
There's ruler Andrang in the buffet.
16 Students drew about laughing breads, tomates, and sweet.
The Technical University Braunschweig and the autobuilding cars have invited the machine building and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideaal competition, they will simplify them with VW developers on the car of the future - and all around the peoples cars.
In the law against the most smart heads, many companies are in the middle of the neighborhood fighting and set up, such as VW, to cooperate with universities.
Your mission: The most successful members may recruit in the hearing sales as soon as they come to the work and are running from others.
And because the universities do not show ideas of their students' performances, you are trying to discover the exceptional Talents in practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig we're the cars around the talents.
A young lady from the personal department distributes bottle writers, gumbernators and folders with VW-Logo.
She told the hopeful young people of practical programmes and student jobs and showed them the ways in the concerts.
Nico Cell from the TU Braunschweig includes the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students are contacting the industry and collecting experiences."
"VW can learn students at the same time, looking at interesting candidates closer and considering who are working in question."
Such cooperation, such a cell, is not unusual.
Repeat that the students are so offensive.
"Soon the weight point was better on the fashion project," says Cell.
The battle on the fresh gradients will be more heavy.
In many branches, the enterprises can no longer choose their employees from a large scale of applicants.
In particular, they need to be priced and, in particular, with high-quality work forces.
In particular, the engineering lines are located in an exciting position of negotiation.
According to the Deutscher Engineering VDI, more than 40,000 engineering plants remained unemployed in October.
And the so-called engineer lucky will be increased by VDI prognoses.
For the economic audit and consultation undertakings KPMG, Roman Dy is on the talents.
He organizes advanced recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern snippets in which the participants must find their path based on GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company such as in the next year, as well as in the United States.
Furthermore, the KPMG branches can be viewed and familiar with the company.
Whoever is able to decide in two election areas in the case.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants is in the United States.
When the high potentials at the universities are hooked and stepped, the high potentials will always be greater than the Dy.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"Only a simple seal was too little."
For the Talent Taylor Dy seems to be accounted.
"We have contact with all participants of a similar action in the last year."
"Now some stand before their conclusion and want to be asked with us soon," he said.
Besides the direct bull in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also classic in professional meets on the pig.
"We're trying to get defenses on experts."
"It's on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, staff leader of the Solar Technology manufacturer.
The Bonner company works around 1500 employees in Germany.
Pubbes know about adult problems.
Currently, 35 posts are published on the business website.
"It's just very hard to make vacant positions."
"It costs much time and money," she says.
Another way is contacting the university professionals.
Solarworld cooperates with various high schools, including the University in Freeberg.
"Professors show that you can do practice with us or write your diplomatic work."
Your reactions are not indicated in the solar specialists.
This is why the company is trying to translate with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flexible hierarchies and easy communication.
"It can't offer a large concern often," says personal leader Stabbe.
money doesn't play the main role for job search.
Flexible worktimes, childcare or growing opportunities are other decision-making.
Solarworld was the 55th place under the 100 best employees of Germany in a large place to Work Institutes.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employees.
This questions workers how they are satisfied with their work and their job area and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
Personal leader Stübe also hopes for the location of additional points in the workers.
"I think the applicant is particularly looking at external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Re日 Warlers from the German Employer Branding Academy relate to companies who want to build a good call with a long-term hold.
He advises his customers too higher authenticity.
And that means, as warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make it attractive as employee is to overcome its own workers," he says.
In Branchenjargon, the internal worker is Branding, so workmarking training within its own holding.
"To the workers are the best messengers."
If you are well-treated with his people and identify them with the company, they would be able to take their friends and aware of their employees.
"It's like a game with bands," says warler.
Obama stops new oilboatings
Before the coast of the United States of Florida in Mexico Golf, there will be no new oilboats in the next years.
A relevant prohibition adopted the Government in Washington and thus revoked its former plans.
Moreover, before the Atlantic Coast, new bourses are being subjected first.
This shared Ken Salazar in the middle-week.
Exploitant for the strike prohibition to apply at least for the next five years is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" platform in April.
Before the disaster that elf workers costed life and leaded to the largest environmental disasters of the United States, President Barack Obama signed on the pressure of the opposition and industry to allow new trains in the rational part of Mexico golf.
In order to reduce the dependence of the United States of oil supply from the outerland.
Whoever takes the responsibility for the wedding oil test in the golf is not finally claimed until today.
In the center of the criticism, the British Energy Concern BP is confronted with billion requirements.
An investigation committee in Obamas' mandate shall present its results within December.
In October, the Internal Minister Ken Salazar has rejected the bohrstop after the explosion.
At the end, different oil concerns had also made requests for new bohr facilities.
With increasing controls and stronger security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
Currently, the competent control auditor, which was made in consequence of a number of corruption plans, is fundamentally reformed.
Parallelly, Obama announced to closure lucrative tax slips for the oil and gas concentrators.
The industry now warns that the amount of promotion in the golf would be clearly lower than until now.
"The government's plans are the largest breaming for the growth of oil and gas industry," it is the result of a current broadcast issue by the BDO adviser firm - even before the middle-week trade.
The American Energy Alliance also regrets the uncertainty in the branch: "Nobody knows what will change with the regulation."
Investment in new promotion projects would be focused on further - loading the growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oilbrown, it's rided as in the tank place: billions of litres of roh oil have cut off the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from deep steel, corruption and illegal oil cook.
Celestine Akpobari doesn't mean it's good.
"Don't get off," the ecoactivist assured the journalists, "You'll get enough oil lamps before the lines today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the trial to light a kids that are in the water to breast with the surrounding shields: In the rainbow water ng, the scene is almost beautiful.
It is not to be seen that under the surface is breune oilwades weapons.
Earlier, they collected the garnels here, he told Esther Badom at the Bodo-Jetty River Round.
In the meantime, the ship was completely dead.
Five years ago, however, from a worst roadway Unmengen Roh oil in the large wheat area.
Fisheries from the nearby placed Bodo must now have six hours of wheat to reach fisherous weapons: the Ogoniland in the heart of the Nigerdelta is one of the worst regions of the world.
On the road through the fluid flows through mangroven sumps, the whole measure of the destruction will appear.
Instead of light water, the motorboat winds brawn wheels, who touchs his hand into the water, brings out oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroven trees are like black lactic stones out of the ground, tristly allowing palms to be stuck to deal with their wheels.
Birds, such as they are usually in fucking areas, are seeking forgiveness: When the foreign border is weakened, the earlier paradise is spread as a tanking station.
"What happens here is environmental war management," Celestine Akpobari says: "We live in constantly for health."
The war comparison is made.
The seat area of Ogoni has been a fighting field since years: here the first experts from Europe have been introduced over 60 years ago, organized here in the 80s, with the successful Ken Saro-Wiwa writer, the first opposition, here the Shell Concern 1993 had to set its production because it was too accessible for its oil worker.
Today, the enterprise has been rejected to Ogoniland: Currently from the whole deltar region of Switzerland with more than 5000 sources and 7000 kilometers of road guides each day more than two million fass of the black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland, are instable to the concern.
All hundreds of meters raise sticky places such as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called too harsh.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them corrupt to the market.
Anyway, such a bowhead breaks up again, says Akpobari, then runs a constant roh oil into the water.
More than two billion litres, after expert assessments in 50 years of the Deltas ecosystem: Year for year, the amount of oil, as they were in the Hague of the Supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago into the sea before Alaska - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the persistent eco-GAU will be addressed to it.
In the currency of the Shell Concern Sabotage and the organized oil depth steel for more than 90% of the confusion, see the environmental heads and the beautiful pipelines as the main causer.
Shell sets lower security standards in Nigeria, mostly in the world, the US scientist Richard Ste ́s suggested to the concern 2008: Only the rate of defects to guides is "for simplicity than anywhere".
On a place that looks out of the remote as a leaved, oil-smitted workplace under free heaven, draws up from the mangrove designs: they are splitted and smitted up to the hair of oil.
Under one of the many feet that are partly related to R ́s, partly spread in the area, a fire flakes: a illegal small raffinery.
In the fass, the roh oil is drawn over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, gases through the rubber into the beginning, then throwing out at the end of the cherosin management and s≤ Diesel.
Thus, Michael and four employees each day produce up to four feet Diesel to 300 litres: "This brings us 34.000 Naira" - about 22.
The population of Delta uses the chronic disorders in the largest earthly olive state of Black Africa.
Nigeria's only one raffinery.
The price of almost 40 euro cent per liter is lately low, can still offer the illegal cowers: because they get their rubber in other cases.
It comes from "Bunkers", which broaden the pipeline network, and that's how the country is going to lose at least 16 million litres of oil every day.
However, only a small part of the provisional intermediate rubber is distributed illegally: the lion share fills organised criminal networks, which also are to be more and high-range military, in Tankschiffe and destroys it in the world.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is already charged for the environmental developments of the population or the laxed production way, the activist holds akademically.
"If the Oil Society hadn't been intrigued and hadn't made the foundation of the fish's lives so fundamentally, there would be no Sabotage, no depth steel and illegal raffiners."
In the meantime, the relationship of Ogoni is especially to Shell, but so much that only a decline from the concern is asked: "It is likely that other nationalities like the Chinese are better out."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"The maximum time you're gone," says the muscle oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil deliverers are obtained by the special unit of the fighting forces, they are not imprisoned, but a painful payment.
Moreover, the soldiers of the country's landscape want - like all Nigerian - to benefit from the rock.
"This fucking testimony has brought our country on the dog in any way," says Akpobari.
Explorer discovered annual building errors in A380 drives
The A380 appears to have a great security problem.
Experts have discovered a potential building error in the investigation of a not-landed machine that could lead to a "katastrophal triple outcome".
The Fluglinie Qantas now wants to control the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the not-landed Qantas Airbus first November have apparently had much more happiness than until: The Australian air security auditor has a great security problem in their investigations in the works of some A380 machines - and now warns about a possible building error.
The potential defect would have severe consequences: In an oil closure connection, it could produce risks and lecks, it was called in one opinion of the ATSB authority published on Thursday.
This could lead to "a catastrophal triework outcome".
Rolls-Royce was carried out in 20 aircrafts of the A380 roads.
In addition, the Qantas-Airbus had to notland in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian flight company has now initiated legal steps against the British Turbin manufacturer.
It introduces a complaint on an Australian Bundesgericht in Sydney, which allows him further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Cheef Alan Joyce said that his flight company will request the damage for the interaction begin November.
At the engine's burning parts were solved and protected the trag areas.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause for damage.
After the intermediate case, up to 40 triples are to be changed worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the tissues concerned.
The security order is the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said the ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been considered to be sufficiently important to inform all the concerned.
After the Qantas machines were injured, the flight company held its A380 float for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
The airhansa changed the triangle in a A380 as a preview measure.
The double-speaked fêer is the biggest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall l日 Verscaos
Germany is totally white: About night has fallen nearly throughout the country snow.
In many streets, chaos, moves and flights fall.
In automobile accidents, at least three people were alive.
The winter frozens Germany: In needy temperatures, the whole Republic is almost accessible on Thursday - which leads many places to Verscaos.
In the north and east, partly 15 centimeters of depth snow.
On several cars and many streets, the verity is strongly restricted.
At the A7 in Flensburg, the winter service was at the duration of the winter, but it was not completed with the continuing renewable snow.
Moreover, the east east coasts were thrown up strong boys.
The Federation for Sea Chief and Hydrography (BSH) is expected at the East Sea Coast Schleswig-Holsteins from the earlier morning of sturm flows with water conditions of 1,2 meters above normal level.
In Sachsen, the snow movement on the cars and the shipways led to major problems.
According to the unweatercentral meteodia, in Saxon, the alarm level was violated - the highest level at all.
Partly there falled 30 centimeter snow, fresh and strong winds for disturbances.
There remained a number of loans and cars in the night.
Moreover, in Sachsen-Reserve, the police members reported great slips on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to a stocking weather and stone.
In Thuringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snow accidents.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are significant sceptings in Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Thuringen and North Bayerns.
Snow on the glasses, rounded trees on the skin or sneaked oversights and weights are the main problems.
In Sachsen, the telecommunication from Leipzig to Nürnberg was required.
In the Turkish Hall field, a ICE after München had to stop his journey.
The 165 carriers were provided by firewalls and salvation helpers with wool cooks, foods and drinks in the train.
Snowwinds went over the streets.
On large German airports, snowwinds lead to a number of flight accidents.
In München, a speaker of the airport center has already been reported some cancellations.
In Frankfurt, a Fraport speaker was already driven 40 flights.
The winter service is at the duration.
Although only few passengers were disturbed at the aircraft, yet they were still prepared for about 400 field beds.
On many roads, the middlewoventh had been accidents.
On the evening, a Lkw-fahrer came to life in the combination with a train on a travel in Ostholstein.
The leader was easily hurt.
In near Nürnberg, there was a similar accident due to snow covered roads: even here a laptop was found on a travel transition because the vehicle was staying.
The driver came to life.
In the train, four passengers were hurt - the streak of Bayreuth to Nürnberg was locked until the morning hours.
Moreover, a 30-year-old woman died after she had overcome her car in Aschaffenburg on a glass road.
A message has the meteorologists, however, that the snow will still be lower and pulvery, so it will be in the light boys.
But the wind's going to swim.
Only the East Sea is visited by fast and swimming winds.
However, it remains very cold - at least 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her whistle
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its signs: According to a newspaper report, the money house buyer searches for the two offices at its main seat of Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the immobility.
First, the German Bank has made its concern seat beautiful: the twilling towers in Frankfurter banken are modernized; among other things, the banks returned to their old workplace.
However, now the financial concern wants to recover the costs for renewation - and seeks a buyer for the two householders, as the "Financial Times German" writes on a speaker.
The reasons for the planned sales were not called the speaker.
"We always check whether it is more sensible to acquire or overwhelme the immobility and then return," he said.
This means that the largest credit institution of Germany has renewed its company's seat after a short time.
The Bank took the double towers for 272 million euros in the midst of 2007 by investors of a household fund and then sanated permanently.
The energetical construction has lost the information by approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would like to give the bank a lot of money.
Branch experts appreciate the value of the towers between the named "Greentowers" of the journal at approximately 500 million euros.
If the buildings are re-explained to a fund in the possession of the bank or to an independent investor, it is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands of dead friends
More than 100,000 people in New Zealand thought of the dead mountains who were explained after several explosions in a mine for death.
The body couldn't be hidden yet because the security sets in the disagreement warrant continued.
Nearly two weeks ago, it came near the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth to a heavy explosion.
29 mountain workers between 17 and 62 years were destroyed in days.
One song was left in the disaster ship, but no track of survivors was found.
As a result of high consumption of toxic gas and further explosions, no salvation force could be reduced from security reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts went out that there was no longer a chance of survival for the friend.
The body could not be hidden until now.
Now members and friends with a memory of the dead.
Ten thousand people were gathered on the southern island in Greymouth in the railway sunlight.
They're moving for two minutes.
To honor the broken mountains, 29 tables were set, on which healing, lamps and the names of the friends were seen.
Also pictures and personal objects, including clothes and surfbretters, found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were half-mass wounded.
New Zealand had hoped that the mountains would "from the depths of the earth" come back to the surface, the New Zealand Minister John Key said to the participants of the Memorial Festival.
"But they never came home."
He cannot conclude with the death of his son while he has not seen his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was cast into the grave.
Besides the Minister and the members of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial festival.
In the first explosion on 19 November, the British and South African mountains were also deleted.
Saving workers began to remove a fire inside the coal work on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gas is disturbed, it will be started to coal the lighting temperatures within the mines, President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To the Höge, warriors!
Splatters match the art kino?
The ruler Nicolas Winding Ref is running with the "Walhalla Rising" old Genre greenzens with the fighter epos "Walhalla Rising".
What public may have thought of the Danish Governor Nicolas Winding Ref when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner Wikinger warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) delivers himself from his peiners and puts his enemies with nearly overhuman forces - it sounds ideal for young men's survivors looking for blutting action, just because our herd likes rabbid killing methods and his enemies have already traveled from the living body when he has bad laughs.
On the other hand, a film, as it is actually called, is not a word, and the other figures may be at least one or two seats or a few qualifying dead claims.
Otherwise, it is widespread and swift in the extremely beautiful township of Scotland, which offers the whiking world the culisse from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal better for growing cineasts with interest in existingism and very hard camera vehicles.
It's good if a movie has several target groups, it's just lost if it's excluded.
Regisseur Winding Refn applies since his wild and stealed dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses to make his work more humor access to the stream or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most artistic kino friends must be lost from the brain mass and the heat.
The Action-Fans will die lately before a long time, when a hold of free-interpreterable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries through the ship to Jerusalem and finds an everlasting life in Flaute and Nebel before the community appears to come into America and continues to weigh there.
No wonder so that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has found no kino delivery and is now only on DVD.
This is especially because of the famous pictures, but also because behind the pretensive to blurry fashion is hidden a bit-speaking kino that has deserved some attention.
This film doesn't refer to dialogues or a stringent action, it's all the atmosphere, a film-written fiber droom.
And there are no entries from it for the watchers.
Relief does not give him a moment of repair and strikes him with his neighborly images and the dark trance-artist soundtrack quite slowly to the wheel, especially with the unfashable hate that resists him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blonde boy, who is faithful to the side, keeps something like an innocent, all others are wounded by anger.
Most of the unclean herd, whose motive never will be explained, but for enemies and temporarily associated, sometimes will be to the warrior from the Heaven, perhaps to the messenger of the Devil himself.
He means destruction, but maybe only for the destruction.
"Walhalla Rising" is a racious film that you can hate and be amazed to harm, upset and stone.
A experience.
Agricultural work
The Atom Energy IAEA has new indications on a secret nuclear programme.
However, the country is inclined to take place - it still allows controls.
At midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israelian F-15 I Kamp Aircrafts are adopted by a mysterious, whirl-formed building.
It is at the hall of the Euphrat; the next largest city, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur.
His name is listed in documents of the International Atomic Energy Holder (IAEA) when it is about the reacter that has built the reactions with help from Northern Korea in the quarter, hidden in a valley that descends from the power.
According to a letter from the US-Eastern Secret Service of the end of April 2008, it would also have been appropriate to make Pluto ́ - from which atomic weapons were built.
However, for other purposes, the technology does not come from the fifths.
The video presentation leaded to uncharged satellite images.
By computer animation, she encountered the components of the reaction before the zers, which was a clear copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon atom.
She also presented photos that show the building out of the nearby.
The reacter was shortly standing before the injection, he called it, but not yet being controlled with burning.
Today, more than three years after the bombardement, it is almost more than that time, because the rats have become more bigger with the time.
The former US President George W. Bush had recently enthusiased in his memories that the appeal had been rightly sure that there was a reactor in el-Kibar, but a few points of detention that there was a "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe are more careful and only speak of a "favorable reaction", even if they hold the "plassable" presentation.
You missed hard evidence, as IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reacter before himself, a high UN diplomatic answered just lapidar that IAEA had "suficient material to ask questions".
The shot of the "unused military building" made the Syrians clearly covered and planned the land.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under the former leader-spective O日 Heinonen in el-Kibar tracks of Uran, which was produced by humans.
Furthermore, the IAEA received a Member State of satellite providers from time to time after the attack that could be more powerful than those presented by the Â.
However, these records are not to be obtained on the market because the unknown employer - perhaps Israel - has exclusively cooked it.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot make its reality independent.
Âen has always contributed to never running a secret atom program or building a reacter.
The Uran came from the Israelite weapons, explained.
This, however, showed that IAEA was unlikely returned after the particulate analysis.
Since then, it refuses to discuss it - just as about the satellite images.
In addition, the controllers denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the trumpets of the broken building.
But Israel also is weak to yellow.
"We will never comment this," confirmed the youngest official Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has gone unexpectedly since June 2008 and has "increasingly developed to a serious problem of credibility for the Authority," as a high west diploma has been reached at the IAEA seat in Vienna - a serious deterioration against the Atom Weapons Contract in the area on which IAEA is expected.
As a key to progress in the advice, IAEA appears to see three other institutions to be "in functional connection" with the mutual reacter - and other than this still exist.
The inspectors have no longer opened what facilities it is, or what function they have or what they can show.
According to the South German magazine, they are used in the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, and are again driven from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and found on satellite images a building complex in Masyaf, where it is most likely to be one of the conscious objects.
It may be in or directly a military point - with this reason IAEA's access to the three places.
In Wien, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that IAEA will be sent by the United States to explore military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had been observed by a tip of US secret services on the institutions.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quarter of the Euphrat material was imported and transported.
A high west diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the installations could be "related to the fuel production".
But there is "no indication of sensible Assets", so uran riqueting or recycling; processes needed to build atomic weapons.
Although the type of reaction is operated with Uran, which is not sufficient.
However, where the Uran should come and where the Pluto should be removed later for the bomb, these central issues are, however, pleasable disturbances.
It is also unclear if dreams that could be valuable tracks were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of last charges were disappeared from the ground, nobody wanted to have information about where the shot is staying.
The only few kilometers of el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat salzmine al-Tibni, which in 1998 examined their equation as a stock for radioactive Mâ, is the IAEA as unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently joined her in an analysis of satellite images for the renamed magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
The records from the orbit, however, show that the trees in the three deceased places of earthwork took place and large containers were remote after IAEA had requested access.
This may be a case, but it has little to be able to clear the deception.
In addition, the IAEA has used a few months to develop a plan for inspections that should allow it to verify any military secrets - only shows how large the interest of the inspectors is.
Indess, the Commission also rejected this proposal.
Having western diplomats in Vienna even a year ago, the reacter was yes, so the thing had no high difficulty, it brought about US boots Glyn Davies a few months along with special inspections in the game, one of the weakest means that the Vienna has to carry out controls.
IAEA's Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "a option for which I am open in the future", but he is still aware.
There is a high risk in this way: for one thing, there is a majority of the Governing Council of the IAEA, and some of 35 countries represented there are all other than a scale.
For others, how to think about a diplomat, "What if they don't find anything?"
Love in the days of war
Since Angelina Jolie has started in summer with the work at her yet unnamed royal debt, there are troubles.
The Dressbook has written herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know anymore - but it's enough for injury.
The wrath, the woman, a Muslim, feels hardly loved during the Yugoslavia war in their serb prosecutors.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and there are short-term drehdays planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the movie is turned into Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of women of war victims wrote about the UNHCR refugee work in Jolie and requested a meeting with the show player, has now reported a bosnical journal - Jolie is even a newspaper of the United Nations refuge shelf work.
It's not diplomatic - she offered a meeting in Hungary for weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must be located in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in Migration Champs have not given it, and Jolies' standing against the victims has given her enough over the rotation book.
Accordingly, its organization recommended the UN refugee shift work to leave Jolie as a newspaper, reported by the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Cultural Ministry, which had been reading, has granted an authorisation for Sarajevo after some Hin and Her - it is not clear why Jolie didn't come.
The young man self emphasizes, she does not follow political intentions with her film, has taken a lot of effort in the Jugoslavian conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and gives a vote to all the shared parties.
However, the content remains vague.
Thus, another second synopsis to the movie in the network, which then sounds pretty different: The loved ones knew it before war breaking and met again when they, a bosnish muslim, were split into a Serbish camp in which he was awake.
What it sounds significantly different than the variance of the "software victims" in fuller slaves.
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, so Jolie, is "injust and based on failure information".
Now you can only make the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the book, as many before, illegal in the network.
Nothing like this.
This evening it finally runs right around for the Ireans.
No track of trouble.
That is why the home team dominates his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans joel for joy in crachend la ́Music, they stomp with the feet.
The Bailey pub in the Southern Cork is beaten because the players threads over a three-meter distance in beerbeckers - and takes it.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre speed, to win, there are 500 euro winning premiums plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the bierpong wildstuffs in January.
Cian Tanner is a silent type; this screen drink game and the retaining information, which is not really matching.
Yet, the 26-year-old is trying to be amazed to deal with what the future will bring.
On plan, it is not a game path in Las Vegas, he will lead a request talk in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mild feeling of it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I'm still not working there."
Always: His friend's already waiting for him in Auckland - " she had relaxed, shocked her desire as a event manager, perhaps a sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of the dancers have already searched for their happiness in the foreign.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as a IT brother in London.
The boys go: Like the dancers, it looks on the island in many families.
1000,000 Ire are going to leave the country in the next time, says experts of the ESCR Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even count with 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4,5 million inhabitants a violent loss.
When the predicts are preserved, it is comparable to an emigration source comparable to those under Ireland in the eighteen years.
After a decade of the rebellion, which made great pleasure for the Ireans, it is now a great trist.
In particular, the economic crisis is insured by the young, well-leaving Ireans for which it has only been forward to this time.
The loss of job and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, money was overflowed.
In the meantime, three of the women and men are under 30 without work.
In the Irish Times, there are readers of young emigrants who claim, "All goes down in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against the bankers and the bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one makes the light out."
Jura Studentin Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, looks at a dark future because the Government only operates an eyewitch and does not offer the young people any future perspectives.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no way to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
It observes how their committees are dealing with an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is it to have to emigrate for four years.
"This idea is triumphing and depressing."
In this case, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to put the topic positive.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a mez that provides a roundum service for the subject of work in the foreign.
"The work in the foreign is a great opportunity to make the first steps on the carrier traveller," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: Work in the foreign is not a galery service, but also a freedom and a pleasure.
As it feels where to build something, Seán O'Donovan knows since a half year.
Because there was no more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he was now with 15 Irish colleagues on the building in Germany.
In Gelsen Churchs, they just move a house up.
In January, it continues to go to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home sees O'Donovan only rare, because he makes extra checks to pay the credit for his house home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, "when he goes to the first time after a long time over his house's wound.
"I deserve money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am as well as ever."
He's laughing, and he's running through cold rooms.
The small house is located in a fine apartment with acquired gardens, in the income parking big, thirsty cars.
Along with a sister, O'Donovan cooked the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 Pro · credit.
"There were foolish times, there were simple money without many questions," he said.
Did he say that it could be worth the credit?
O'Donovan overlooks a while, shoots thee and says, "I have no children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything flows, I can start from new."
The building engineer doesn't like the damage that he hears.
"Nobody needs to hungry - but our situation is not as dramatic as in ancient times here on the island," he says.
"Only working in the outerland, that's not the worst thing that can do -- maybe we feel it only as Iren."
He laughed and then told him by Father, who has passed in the last large economic crisis to England.
"Near seven years he was back and life went to Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just see how it works with life where it is.
A few years of work in London he has already been behind, and why should it not work well in New Zealand for him and his friend?
One thing, however, is still there that is disappointing him in these days: the celebration at 27. Birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could be in a live-chool party.
"Not just too many emotions," he says and drinks a big shock of beer.
"Life choice, that sounds terrible."
"Let us call it a roadparty, very locker, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger as the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than the United States.
These results came to the Latin Barometer Question, which was carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economyst.
This question has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two persons are particularly in the eye of this year's investigation from September and October.
First, the vote in Latin America
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and its major institutions.
In many countries in the South America Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, e.g., where the economy has increased about 6% a year since 2002, the number of democraties increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy is renewed since the strong infringement last year, it is to recognize such a trend.
However, only the help of the applicants in Mexico and Brazil, the most popular countries in the region, are convinced by democracy, which reduces the regional average (see graph 2).
Approximately 44% of the applicants claimed that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, such as in the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust in the Congress of their country and 45% of their government, both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a clear increase in 2003 (17% or 24%).
A year ago, Latin America's economic crisis underground the efforts for more democracy.
This also resulted during the world economy crisis is likely that Latin America's countries have experienced only a short phase of recession and have quickly recovered.
Moreover, the poor was started by a stronger social network.
(See the reports of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America for this week, 2009, the poverty rates in Latin America have only increased lowly and has fallen by 32% in this year.)
However, there are strong subdivisions of voting from country to country (see graph 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the delightfulness of the separate President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a broadly advanced thinking.
In Mexico and Mediterranean, where the recession was stronger and has increased violence crimes, this is less than the case.
First of the second time from the start of the investigation, many questions in Latin America in criminality in their country have seen a greater problem than in worklessness (see diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year, but against 38% in the last year, the values have been decreased and thus reached the lowest position since 1995.
The increased economic efficiency reflects in the increased support of the market and the market economy: approximately 71% of the applicants highlighted that the economy for development was unnecessary, 56% in 2007 (see diagram 6).
Approximately 58% claimed that only market economy can progress in its country, compared to 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the applicants in Venezuela have kept this view (and 80% are for an economy), although their left president Hugo Chavez has presented many companies.
Brazil has only 19% of the applicants (18% in the last year) the largest weight in the region followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
The Questioners in Mexico and most countries of Central America see the most influential country in the United States, in which this role will be taken in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A choice slap
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But the facts are overwhelmed by the protection of the electoral helpers who have led the land to help.
Overfighted elections, multiple votes delivered, elections in Rinnstein, severe choices and injuries were only part of the problems.
Elections opened with a long-term delay.
Haitianians, of whom many had become homeless by the earthquake in January, were looking for a choice.
Some put it up.
One decades of presidential candidates, including some mutual leaders, requested the derogation of the election results due to a famous deterioration.
In the whole country there were too much violent protests.
However, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the United Nations mission in Haiti, took the choice "as well in many matters".
According to a precautionary statement of observers of the United States of America and the Caribbean Community, "their irregularities, so they may also be serious, the process is not necessaryly invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral member who is committed to the unrelated President René Preval and ­ candidates, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected choice of steel is covered for January.
There's still a hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the Rap Music Michel Martelly and the former Prime Lady Mirlande Manigat, have returned their initial invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who only finds a few or no agreements in the electorals, explains from the electoral listener to the seller of the election, this could lead to problems.
Because of cholera epidemy and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in Zelts, a small election was protected.
On the election day, many haitianians were prevented by a lack of organization to vote.
Shortly before the election, about 250,000 indications were not distributed for choice.
It's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in rebuilding Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Headly in the middle
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a well of sympathia, which spent 20 points up to more than 50% above. This is the maximum value since their choice in 2007.
However, if you help this in the next year to a re-elect, it depends on whether the cruel Cristina Fernández is more compromised than her disrupted husband, her former and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Nestor Kirchner, who also linked the economic policy after his wife's choice, often established budget plans that did not take into account the tax income, the economic growth and the inflation.
This allowed the President to issue additional incomes according to its own advantages.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the Congress.
However, the opposition was divided, and the churchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further destructions.
Some regime critics from the range of the regional pernaists were behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after Catholic meetings (which a parliament struck one another, and others committed the Government of Employment) the Congress did not agree to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to discuss it," as President.
The budget 2010 is also applicable for the next year, which the President has more opportunities to provide money according to its own views.
The economy runs heavy: it will probably grow up to 9% in this year.
The official inflation rate, e.g., is 11,1%, but numerous private rates - and loan requirements of the workshops - takes the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who adopted the Office in 2003, when Argentinian was struck by economic crisis, explained growth and poverty control to its main objectives, not the inflation inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, schikaned the sector and cleaned the National Institut for Statistics and Population INDEC, which helped the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández put a more moderate way now?
It has called the economy and the Community leaders to talk.
And, according to official statements, payment increases will be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economic a strong explosion.
However, the inflation underground the growth shadow by a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps Cristina Fernández would like to reconnect to the world's economic resources.
In the beginning of this year, the Government met an agreement with value paper inhibitors who rejected the previous country's survival in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to have an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club whose debt is about $6,7 billion.
The Churchs had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usually in other places.
However, in the past month, the Economic Minister Amado Boudou replied that the fund would be implemented in creating a new national consumer price index "technical support"; it seems like this was the first step to clean the INDEC.
It is not possible whether television will be politically active after the end of its office.
If so, it needs the support of the medium-screen, which mostly has enough from the churchnerism.
When the Argentinans return from their summer vacation, the well of the sympathy that they have been found will be disrupted.
If she wants to gain another choice, she must decide whether she has a lot of political decisions of her husband quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's electors are quietly close to a stronger connection to the festival.
What does Taiwan think of a great brother on the side of the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7,5 million electors, which are 70% of all electorals, were made to choose in the five citizens and citizens. This is considered as a broad evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
With the building of non-contracting business relations, including a part of free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol for the relationships with the festival. His family has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma has the test files, but only buttons.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five citizens, it has not received a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which provides a greater independence in Taiwan, was nearly 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential choice, this would mean problems for Ma.
Since his choice two years ago, the vote share of his party has fallen about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even went into the city road with the KMT.
With the choice, it came to the usual events in Taiwan, such as laaching convoy with crawls carriers, flags-speaking mass movies and solely covered dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder trial.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the president of the KMT, held a talk on a KMT candidate at the previous evening of the election,
When a man shot him out of the many faces. Lien was wounded and killed a survivor.
A stranger is not aware whether the Süe Line would kill or want to fight with the candidate.
Unless it is, the attack states Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affects the choice and the DPP in a bad light, which the KMT has protected more voices.
Maybe China was the greatest winner of the campaign.
Noticefully, the relationships with the festival were not temated.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans on social apartments and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwans love their real independence and refuse China's military threat.
That is why the KMT does not like to put its relations with the Government in Peking.
However, this time the DPP also avoids to hurt the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new knowledge that Taiwan's economy without China could not survive.
Ma, on his side, wants to make sure that the majority of the Thaiwanians will provide its Chinese policies.
The Government in Peking will continue to pursue its responsibility to return Taiwan with economic incentives to the Community.
China immediately sent a subsequent to Taipeh to prepare a meeting on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants a political integration, but the first thing is important.
It is better to wait until the presidential elections of 2012.
The DPP has been renewed.
Two years ago she was strongly weakened: the former leader Chen Shui-bian sat for corruption in prison.
In the year of his Presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was deeply engaged in the absolute independence.
However, under the Tais Government, a new generation has been developed as a prospector, and the DPP is fighting the votes of professionals and young people.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate of the DPP, had a great approval, such as Su Tseng Chang under Chen.
Her party now does everything to show that she is also able to build a close relationship with Peking.
Tsai plans an idea as a contact point between the DPP and China, but it provides free discussions.
Tsai publicly explained that their party offers a "trusted alternative" to Mass rapid approach to China.
Chen seems very harmful about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP candidates would have better done to be on Taiwan's independence.
He even invited the Pragueer Su to go to the presidential candidate.
Even without Chens mixture, the DPP is difficult to choose their possible candidates.
The KMT will need to undertake its own self-analyse.
But the values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their choice fight without it.
The main foundations for his disabilities seem to be unemployment and the remaining degrees between the arm and the kingdom.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet and local installations.
The strong adventure of the DPP allows Taiwan to ensure that renewal is limited.
At the same time, most Thaiwanians see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "do not return anymore."
Grammy nominations: The Jazz Sangner Esperanza Spalding was surprised in the Newcomer category of the year
If you argue on the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to come at the ceremonie for the 2009 Nobel price delivery. Now the 26-year Jazz bassist and songman was nominated for the current year-old grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
Since the fact that Spalding since its "Esperanza" album in the Jazz scene 2008 is already a star, the nomination appears a little unusual. But it corresponds to the grammy rules after which a artist could have issued at least three albums before publishing the album, with which he was published in the large public.
Your equivalent album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is probably a step forward. And with their forced voice and a good speech for Pop, Radio and Latin Music, you can hardly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as Jazz-interpretin in this category of nomination Spaldings comes next.
In addition, the "Historicity" album of Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrumental albums, which thus experienced a riesening success.
The competitors of Iyers belong to the "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a famous favorite from New Orleans and a common guest in HBOs "Treme", was exposed in the category of the timegenous Jazz, in the other other albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the Wild Steampunk Music Darcy James Argue was worthy of attention in the Category of the Great Group. He thus acted against Billy Childs Em日 with the Camer-Jazz and the absently Dave Holland and his oct, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is an example for a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads to the classic category
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Award contain a complex mix of musicians and composers from all the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machina" is listed for the klavier and orchester with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an ecological orchester work, with three voices.
Under the nominated connections to South-California, the Estonian componist Arvo Pärt is with his symphonie No. 4 "Los Angeles". This track was given by the Los Angeles Philharmonikers in order and held in 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer in L.A. was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided in 13 categories, by Orchester, Opera, Chor to Solo receipts.
In the classic product category, five artists were nominated in this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Under the nominated classic albums, Bruckners are the Symphonie No 3 and 4 of the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony Orchestra" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" is provided by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.

The 30-minute track brings the title "Los Angeles" and is divided by the former oilmagnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, sitting in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the instrumentalsolo category with orchester.
The composer from L.A. indicated that he wrote the 15-minute part specially for the Mandoline artist Avi Avital, which introduced the concert with the New York Metropolis En日.
"I used sounds from the Near East and many northern African tons and Rhythmen," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of Orchester work for a record of the works of Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphonieorchester under his leadership.

Moschee in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The building of a moschee in Temecula was found after a five-hour, often quickly public audience the unique advice of the local Planning Committee.
Criticals propose the project to promote both terrorism and verdicts.
However, according to a statement of the Commission of the middle-week, the new religious area corresponds to local provisions and will become a esthetical degree.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley tomorrow.
"It makes me proud as Americans."
"It shows that justice is ruled."
"There's only a few enemies," he's still added.
"They're just very sound."
"In this valley lives wonderful people."
The meeting started at 18:00, and the discussions for and against the building of the center was almost until the middle, while the votes on both sides were very equally distributed by Press Enterprise.
The debate was conducted on the website of the journal.
"There is no more America," a comment said.
"It's another opening planet, and the freedom state is dead in the sand."
"America's at the end."
Planned islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as in the nearland of Ground Zero, the City of New York, on 11 September 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
His community with approximately 135 families le日 for years peacefully in the Riverside County. But they wanted a larger and better place than the storage they had met together with a manufacturer for water filter facilities.
The new, approximately 2.300 m2 big moschee in the Mediterranean style must have two mines and become about 13m high.
It must be at around 17.500 m2 a large base on the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still stand against the project at the city Council.
Arsen-resistance microbe could enable new life forms on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign kind of bacteria that can live from arsen opens new opportunities for new life forms on earth and otherwhere.
Since these unusual bacteria discovered here on earth, their view is a sign that a life is also possible without the elements that are expected to be vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs phosphor or arsen to grow."
"It makes it a whole thing, although it is almost a "fremder" lifestyle," said Paul C.W. Davies from the Ar日na State and Co-autor of the report, which appears on Thursday in the output of the magazine Science.
To this end, six main elements were considered as life needed - carbon, water, steam, acid, phosphor and weapons.
However, as the experts found, where the bacteria in the Californian Mono Lake is still when it is replaced by phosphor by arsen.
"The Co-autor of the report Ariel D. Anbar from the Ar日na State" said.
The discovery is an important step in searching for foreign life, where social life and its forms have to be recognised, so it is.
The Property is related to microbs found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details about discovery were provided, has been given too large speculated in the Internet that the report on the discovery of external life could be handled.
This isn't the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organs can handle biochemical processes with other elements and that the "standard components" that our opinion is absolutely vital have not been provided," explained Charles Cockell, Professor in the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novum, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures a element can be replaced by another thing," fÃe Cockell adds.
This discovery was not adequate.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's astrobiological Institute, who led the leader, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsen content.
Since arsen and phosphor were chemically equal, she assumed that microbs that are both exhausted may replace a element by the other.
"The dignity of the arsen is particularly concerned that it is chemically similar to phosphor."
"This causes the organism to be difficult to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the subsheed is so large that arsen is different from phosphor. It is reached in our biochemical system, where it is almost all deteriorated," explains Anbar.
The researchers put the GFAJ-1 bacteria into an increased arsenkongravation. It was adjusted and grown.
The microbe who is better in phosphor, but that it can also survive in arsen, shows that a form of life based on arsen, naturally, can occur on earth or on another planet or moon, which is more frequently on the arsen.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Do ́in for microbiology at the face of Florida, is the idea that phosphor can be replaced by arsen, not new. But until now there was no functioning example.
Arsen came more frequently in the early years of earthquake, she says, therefore the responsibility has been out of the use of early life forms.
"This is a reason to assume that life could have developed differently than in the early age of the earth," so Forster, who was not member of Wolf-Simon's research team.
Research work was supported by the NASA, the Energy Ministry and the National Health Auditors.
Recent exhibition center found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibitions shot before a belflower motel were found as stated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff on Thursday.
The four exhibitions - two acits and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Sunday, as known by Chevrolet Express-Van in 2006, where the animals were submitted before a belflower motel 6 night, so the authorities' nuts.
Two of the dogs were discovered at midweek afternoon, and the last two in the midweek night, explained Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The message is: the dogs are up," like Whitmore.
"They're in a state."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not make exact information on the foundation of the dogs, even on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitmore said.
"We follow some tracks."
The dog owners, Christina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for outcome.
They took their two dogs at midweek afternoon in a neighborhood in Downey in receipt.
Sheriff's representatives found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Acitas - Trace, a 3-year-old road, and Didi, a 10-month old hairin - was soundly unforgettable.
However, the Corgis Bunny and Peter, the Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week in their Japanese owner's assignment to competition, remained missing until the middle of the evening.
Peek and Rickard who lived in Redding were on this week because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in competition.
As Peek the Times reported in the middle-week, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple of dogs to dog view.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often overnight in Motels and park their cars before their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer box, a parson Ter and a Brittany - with in her motel room.
The dickless acites and Corgis stayed in the supply car because it was cooler there.
They left the window a wide range, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their cars on Thursday at 6:00.
Peek speaks to everyone who can give a reference to the Corgis, a finder reward. The animals were implanted in microchips for the Implementation.
On Thursday, there was no statement on whether a refund was paid.
The lion shall rebuild after the legal approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18-month turbulences and uncertainties, MGM now finally received green light for a restart.
On Thursday, a New York concurrence judge officially blessed the "prepared" crowd plan to acquire $5 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion and to provide the 86-year entrepreneurship for new movies and television shows.
According to the Thursday statements, the plan fulfils the requirements of the US competition law so that the restart of MGM under the management of Gary Barber and Roger Bird tree, the founders of Spyglas Entertainment, is nothing more in the way. Barber and bird tree will be represented as a leader.
The number of employees is reduced by over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will actually enter into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned facility of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
Currently, a consortium of the investment bank, which self imports $75 million, leads to the company. Financing will be until middle December.
In May 2009, the restructuring of the Os started with the mission to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company's leadership, which had paid 300 million dollars per year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the business leader Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, which was held by his activity in Crispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the MGM financial orders and to pay the more than 140 believers of the Os were longer than expected.
After monthly discussions, the parties decided to offer the company to buy.
However, the auktion was just a few offers and no one wanted to put them in $2 billion.
In the early year of this year, all started from before the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally undertaken by the believers after monthly debates and internal conflicts.
When MGM has overcome the competition in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus for their work of several millions.
The share for Moelis & Co., which already received $1,2 million, is estimated to $9,5 million.
Cooper, paid for the management of the company a monthly $375.000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and bird tree planning to restore production at MGM. In this year, it produced only a movie and created an annual plan with seven or eight movies to come to the Kinos.
They also plan two films after "The Small Hobbit" in Co-production with Warner Bros.
This requires a separate facility between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films that will be under the rule of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM Darlehens, tried a Fusion of the Os with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest actor is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys maintains your provisions in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect Video Console. Both players can take a significant log in your present budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX rates for $99, while the price for a kinect game is about 10 classic spring lines or approximately 48 doses Play-Doh.
But you can make your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic games under $80 three national players - a Wal-Mart, a toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year, the technology games are more powerful and cost a little less than the last year.
And although less new games appear with their own website, it will appear on the most of these types, webkinz and Club Penguin, a larger boat.
There are always more button-handled game tools on the market, and many contain reloadable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not specified otherwise, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are big figures, as big as sea-ma-jigs who sing a note when you are on their bow.
Once pressing matches a note, you can play a song through multiple pressures.
Many Sing-a-ma-d-yigs sang in Harmonie.
Attention: If you have started with the pressure, you can't stop anymore.
For a combination outside and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of Elmo Live technology developed in the last year, the animational puppet offers exchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new scarnier feet with rad blocking, it controls the Moon-Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as dance teacher. However, their parents are accused of the failing volume control.
If you are a kid of the 80s, you will certainly be reminded of Alées, one of the first computerized teachers.
Now he is back there (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a whole number of questions cards that can be a car to a school hour, with a better whistler with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's artphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the most convenient and useful solution, equipped with a qvaluy keyboard. However, the games contained are not as learnable as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which has been installed after Leapprog's first large review of the Leapster road with a new, better screen.
No of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card cycle, family photos can also be considered.
Too good late there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not greater than a stream tree box and have a own LED screen.
The game is to gather the blocks to words before the time is expired. It is greatly adjusted to an improvised booking claim.
Always more games have a kind of online connection.
When you go alone after the boat to the players, Webkinz and Penguin are the most important.
To give your child a online tiger in Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figures Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a currency with a secret code.
If you enter the online code, your child will receive sufficient credits in the Penguin Store club for two other parts.
This may be a rolling shooting or a puffle-stoff animal.
The latest capsules-handed microblock, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not greater than the head of your teeth.
The buyer moves quickly to 12 vibrators of silicone in each direction.
It's a pleasure to send him through an irrgart from a shot.
And he keeps some things out.
Our kitchen was fallen and even spent some time in our dog's mouth.
Police rates in China are decreased
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a stately place, he checked his nervous submissions and delivered military authority and a deep voice orders.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's strong guards of the state order, to be warned and respected for their voluntary divisions and their hand to violence - to impress the survivors.
"Stay right!"
"Blick out!"
"Show them," he claimed to them, "what beautiful girls are!"
Four girls nearly wake up the teenager age, with white hands and identical olive wheat jackets and hosen.
Four black pumps were in the right range.
Four ordinary cups sat perfectly on the hair broken with blue-white hair.
"For me, it looks averagely," Mr. Tang notes lowly.
"Models are beautiful."
Many governments have already tried to polylate the picture of China's citizens.
In a town, all new applicants must have a school conclusion.
The Guangdong province, instead of the grass, introduced a lighting blue uniform.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by Netherstars: reports surrounded in 2009, 50 employees were not correctly installed and looked at the operator until he was packed and left the place after half hour.
Xindu, a city visit in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image basically.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the state police officers and have been chosen specially because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They want to provide a weak, female aspect of the gross police.
Sadly, however, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese of this city commands have.
That's right, the criticians.
In addition to the police, these officers may apply the State laws only by means of payments or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media show routinely another picture.
In January 2008, the officer in the province of Hubei prosecuted a survey to death when he filmed her with Other Mobile, how they hit a protesting action against a Mâ Halde.
In the last year, a training manual of the Pekinger officers was cut off and published on the Internet, which is described in how criminals can be tested without blood loss.
In this year, a Shanghai water melon handler results in a assembly of hands with five officers of brain disorders.
A video game that can be downloaded from the Internet before violence shows training officers in China when attacking road handlers.
"Chengguan makes the Government'st," lamentated the National Journal of China Daily last year, after further conflicts about takics.
The magazine requested a "truely basic cleaning".
Scepticers have the current approach for clearly inadequate.
When the Distrike looked for eight female recruits in October by display, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as optical refreshment.
Probably both.
According to staff indicators, women from 18 to 22 were searched with good figures and "harmonic faces".
You should be excessively large - over 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 tonnes.
The employment relationship ends with the arrival of the 26th year of life.
According to the employees, women's activities are to be too effortful for more than 25 corporately.
"The most important is her image," an unnamed district manager indicated at the nearly government website Rednet.com.
"And the candidates get the job, first depends on their external appearance, how size, weight, faces, etc."
Then the temperament and the "Internal Qualities".
"Free Chengguan are like flower waves," he said and f'e, "but in addition they have other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, head of the town management of the district, does not want to commit this description,
but admitted that in China size conditions in place indicators for both generations are not unusual.
The same applies to equal views.
Whether it is equal to the looks, it is restricted in China.
But people with obstacles or corporate ideas do not need to be accused.
"We can't use sounds or bucklings here," said Mr Zheng.
"Your picture wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang place near a closter, is 22, has appeals and a well-formed mouth.
She didn't feel as a sexist that she had such a great value on her appearance.
"Do you think I'm looking sexy in this uniform?" she asked with ironic crack.
Your college with the grapes, the 21-year Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not long the short position, because they had equivalent carrying plans, as simply travelers through the gates to prevent them from business.
Each morning, the street with approximately twelve road handlers, trying to overcome many breads and tofujus before they are continued.
"Mr. Wang, please leave here."
"We have already told you so often!", said Mr. Xu, a traitor who was at the foot, and then left his nudle kitchen on a road carrier at a time.
According to the employees, the activity is more monoton than stressing.
"It's almost the same day," said Huang Jing, 20, who's studying in free time.
"All Routine."
One reason is that women's employees cannot confiscate the goods of the employees, such as their men's colleagues.
They can only cause criminals to report their men's representatives.
This should be done before public initiations, which often have been issued by employees in China.
In this year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan, after the cursing, Chengguan officers had killed a vendor.
More than a thousand police officers and Chenguan officers were hurt in the night case, 14 government vehicles were packed or covered in fire.
Xindu remained disappeared from such a violent evacuation until now.
However, distortions are not to be excluded.
Only two blocks remote from the strong baonguang place, where the women's officers patrolated this morning, were gathered over 50 people on a road neck.
The staff had confiscated an engine road, which was in accordance with the rules on the citizenship instead of repaired in a workplace.
The owner cried Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes, the officers with a wretched face moved the way to their vehicles and continued with the engine race and owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the men's streets, remained back and turns his white name skin to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a pure underlying role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"People we're going forward."
"May sometimes also physically," Mr Li said nearly.
"The most time people begin with the fight."
State lawyer will not accuse Senator Ensign
State advocates of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations which, after his case, with a former election assistant and trying to make his husband a lobby activity against him, were raised against him, the advocates of the Senator in the middle-week.
This decision ended the most serious legal proposal against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. To the scandale, which was a country-wide career for the rows and was transferred to his car, he became a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns of the Office, he was "hearly satisfied on the judgment after the annual investigation."
However, the Ethic Committee of the Senate could bring a further disgusting punishment.
According to Ensigns advocates, they were informed by the Ministerial of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were made and that there were no further complaints in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express the case.
The sentence was a surprise for many ethic advocates outside the Ministerial of Justice, which was evidence of sufficient evidence that Ensign had missed the Lobbying prohibition.
Interviews, emails and other documents, opened first in October 2009 in New York Times, have given an advice that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electors, had a lucrative task to buy his weaknesses over a business with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was employed as a teacher during a choice campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to make Hampton work. According to the documents and hearings, he took for them after Hamptons Lobby work.
Since Hampton was still in Ensigns election team, he was not able to take a lobby work for a year for his former employee or the whole senate.
According to the statement of ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely friends before the affair, was contrary to the prohibition of the roadhouse lobbycracy.
According to the published index, "is the appearance of an appointment and the deterioration of the tourist states," thus Stanley Brand, a Washingtonian lawyer who has specialized the defense of customers who are in the Government's visator.
Since the Ministry of Justice refused to give the reasons for the decision in the Ensign Fall, Mr Brand and other Eth Wales said that the Minister seemed very carefully to take political complaints after a number of delays persecuted by the media with great interest, the decision in the past year to leave the complaint against the former Senator Ted Stevens on the failure from the State advocate.
State advocates "is obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, the president of the United Nations "Citizens for Respons · and Ethics in Washington" (a organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the United States Parliaments and Government Circles), a group of legal advocates who have made various accusations against Mr Ensign before the court.
"This means fundamentally that high government officers can now be able to conclude that the laws are not applicable to them," they added.
Paul Coggins, the main defendant of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a phone call on a state lawyer on Monday and another day the next day he was informed that the Ministry would not be raised a complaint against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns Defensers have cooperated with the state advocates to convince them that the Senator, as his office was repeated in a middle-week, has acted in accordance with the law.
Mr Coggins refused to declare the legal arguments he had submitted to the State committees.
"I don't want to go into the details between the Ministry of Justice and me, but just so much is said: we believe that we have taken the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to establish investigations for a separate complaint by the ethics group after which a payment of $96.000 by Mr Ensigns has sent parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law.
The election Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something else than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which supported the Senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyists.
A e-mail of December 2008 states that after the company sent Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Stabschef, John Lopez, he had an interview with Mr. Hampton, where he told him that he was in the Ministry of Internal Affairs because of a "appeal".
Mr Ensign was also approved with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, at the mid-day and asked the Minister for Aviation to agree with a meeting on behalf of the flight company after this Mr. Hampton has established the lobby work.
When the last year information was brought to the public for the first time, Mr Ensign was apologizing to his electors and expressed his position in the senate, where he had been at the fourth place in the meeting of the Republicans.
After a lot of months ago, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he tried to work in the senate.
In the announcement that Mr Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigations, his president Jennifer Cooper, the Senator hopes that the Ethic Commission is very quickly following the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calls on Twitter
Half decades of them were drawn into the crowds in the courtyard.
In a minute, they sent their reports on the Twitter about a cruel testimony.
At the end, as the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter communications about the process of administration and bed-capped children in a house that arose in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully persecuted process of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgment on the death sentence that the Jury has spoken.
However, Mr Hayes' advocates have already submitted requests to the Court to present the reasons for a vocation and which will be employed by the courts for years.
One of the most explosive reasons is that through the intensive reporting on the process, including through the rough use of Twitter by media reporters, has been made to a "circus atmosphere" and a so far-breaved, timely transition of more details so that the Jury was inappropriately influenced by the public destruction.
This entry could initiate the calling courts to work with the question whether new technology is necessary for new rules in the Court Hall.
"So as I have learned during this process, I think it's really a matter when the introduction of new technologies into the court Hall affects the right of each individual on a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main defendant.
The President's judge, Jon C. Blue from the Master Chamber Court, showed last week the requests for a short decision when he said that the new media would be "inquiredly controlled" and that there is no evidence that the Jury was carried out by patiences.
But that was not the last word in this matter.
Since years, the Court's reviews have found that the report on the famous and famous cases of doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Chief of the United States of Justice rejected the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Osteopath of Cleveland, who would have killed his wife, and said in his decision that it would have given a "carneval atmosphere in the court Hall" due to the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the game movie "Of the flight" are based on this crime.
Some legal advocates say that the courts, which Mr. Hayes sent a half centuries later, could follow the argument that new rules have been necessary to regulate the ways of communication from the Court Hall, which were still inappropriate in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason for the influence of the new media in processes persecuted by a large public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at the Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some calling courts could be fascinated by the idea that the limitation of an immediate communication from the tribunal could make processes more fair.
The Twitter issue is only one of the many who represent Mr. Hayes' legal advocates to discuss for years and thus forward a sentence.
For example, the defendants also claimed that Mr. Hayes could have already been condemned when judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jury by showing them cruel tattoos during the jury election.
Some of the jury mentioned that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their kidneys, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have fulfilled them with discharge.
The defendants say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argument that the judge had falsely exchanged a judge who was a criticist of the State administration, and that he had inappropriately exercised pressure on the judgment when he had taken the unusual decision to release the Jury on the weekend.
The jury weren't isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of the additional reporting on the process may be the most interested.
In a trial campaign that they had introduced last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and discussed the candidates during the election battle for the office of the Governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media would have continued to refresh the flames of emotions about the case.
"And such a daily adversity of the media pipes, cameras and reporters outside the Court Hall," says the legal advocate, "that you haven't learned before in New Haven and maybe not even in the country."
Your focus on the reporting by Twitter is controvers.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more larger than reports that are more slowly recovered, is a technic endeavor that disturbs the report on future processes.
However, some legal advocates said that calling courts would often be confronted with the argument, social and technical changes needed the adjustment by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' law lawyers strengthen this appointment.
In their commitment, they addressed the decision of the Master Court of Justice of 1966, where Dr. Sheppard was rejected on the basis of the reporting, and made clear that the new media need new rules.
"This case," says she, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21th century."
Can the divorce be connected?
Following a campaign of shimpfords and negativeness, this week is a little splendidness in Washington.
Is it the bird of a real two-party co-operation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the fight of the parties in the main city?
The meeting on Sunday between President Obama and the meeting of the Congress has not been interrupted in the major issues with which the "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period where no decisions were taken anymore.
According to all that you hear, there was no offensive debate between two different pages or a view of their shared responsibility, but also a empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meeting of the Commission of the President on the middle-week was civilized, despite the political subdivisions continued between the members.
It seems to be clear that a strong interaction allows a mutual respect to develop the ideological cloud that continues to separate members from each other.
This is not enough to assume that there is a new era of cooperation.
Both pages are now in a test phase - which requires one of the other signs of cooperation and compromising preparation, while it is trying to decline the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electors after a renewed war.
Therefore, the meeting was limited on Thursday himself and its assessment by the participants to a minimum of requests or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep as you could expect a quick change of the atmosphere, which was governed in the past two years.
Anyway, it's about taxes, S., health or expectations that are both sides away from each other.
Too good late, the November election of Washington has at least voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, a official representative of the Bush Government, who now is for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"It's incredible for choices.
Choosing to survive partial sufferings that are resurrected.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially in those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck session", the Republicans and the Democrats have no choice to find other than a solution."
Bush's tax accounts end the year's end, and no one forgets that.
Both pages want to find a way to get some or even everyone, being temporarily or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise is to be expected with regard to increased unemployment taxes, even though the Republicans cannot allow it to believe that the favoured tax rates for the wealth are rejected, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After meeting on Thursday in the White House, the optimism is assured that during the "lame duck session" you can handle some of the new START contracts in these issues.
However, William Glasston of Brookings Institute warns that an effort to cooperate in the thrilled issues of the lame duck session" must not lead to a sustainable cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-compliance is more likely, perhaps even inappropriate.
"When things have been done, these short-term psychology will be killed in conflict," he said.
The vineyard is also skeptic - and this scepsia is divided by many - leads to true cooperation.
"I see many things happening from today to 2012 as a pre-government, or shadow box, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the creation of the new Republican majority in the white house and with the teeparty electors who served their education.
As the Republican leaders are concerned may also be too highly pokered, they know that they have to try to keep their promises to reduce the issues of the Government and to put the health reform outside force.
These partylines will already be made clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the Commission, which includes a tax reform and the recovery of certain taxes, as well as the decreasing of the pensionary and the reduction of State expenditure.
The President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own estimation, have so much forced to put the question on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan for an official recommendation, and they were very fighting to get close to this number.
The largest opposition is found in the chosen representatives of the Gremi, since in financial questions, at least today, is only a few playspaces or a little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in the Congress.
The first battle will be placed next year in the form of partial co-operations when the Republic of Obama is in question of the State budget, tax and health system, then followed by a stage of bigger two-partial cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The new opinion.
It is evident that, despite the partiality of the current election, most Americans still want to work together.
If confrontation leads to a sackgasse, as happened in 1995, both parties must take care of the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose will change the course and have to search for compromises.
This can actually be a optimistic view.
Partiality and polarisation are today greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological cloud between Obama and the Congress Republicers than their time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure example for a very larger election in the context of 2012.
This is how many Americans can be welcomed by the advantage that this week will be seen.
However, on both sides it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that both separately.
Transsegured US document portraits Moscow as the court of corruption
The town's control is in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it provides part of the payment and the protection payment it collects to the creml. In February, it reported the Russian message in a memo.
As the police and the State security service are pressed by high protection payers so that they can maintain their deep life standard in Moscow, so it means.
They collect money not only by legitimate business, but also by organized criminal bands.
Each shift of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has dealt with as "Verticals of the Authority" - takes part of the money that the leader turns up.
The memo, sent under the name of the advocate John Beyrle to Washington, was published on Sunday of WikiLeaks on his home page.
The memo is based on sources that have been edited.
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow citizen, and it accuses him of corruption.
In October, the President Dmitry Medvedev was held, but there is no evidence that it would have been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who are a buildingfirma, have always rejected corruption plans over years, and he has won many accusations against such accusations.
In September he explained a Russian television sender when he was asked after a documentation, which suggested that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy."
> An incredible number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as the messager report has occurred, individuals are called, and it is unhearted that this happens by a diplomate of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Government of Moscow with the criminality has led to some of them to be "good" and to conclude that the government is more like a cleptocrate than a government," so the memo.
"Kriminal elements enjoy a "krishna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which significantly means "Dach" or Protection), which is aware of the police, state security (FSB), the service supervisory (MVD) and the Office of the State Advocate, as well as the entire Moscow Government Office.
Experts have discovered a three-way structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is the chief place."
"FSB, MVD and Milis are at the second level."
"Culet" follows the criminals and criminal inspectors at the lowest level.
"This is an incompatible system in which criminal groups in some areas are locked because the city doesn't offer any help."
The report continues to say that the FSB is missing money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small business members.
A source, as it is said, "declared that Moscow business inhibitors understand that it is best to get protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crimes), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals but also because they are undertaken by the law."
"For this reason, the protection is not as questioned by criminal gangs as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very smart; even those who buy are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't shoot find their business very quickly closed - due to one or other event.
Medvedev has spoken many times about combating corruption, but at the same time he has noticed that he has just made a little progress.
The message's memo contains descriptions of men who walk into the cream with coffees that probably were full of money.
"In the fight against corruption, Medvedev must leave the officers," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert committee recently in an interview.
"But he is part of this Office."
"There is no part of the political class because there is no more a political class in Russia."
Without any opposition, without the trend of the forces, he says, corruption is inevitable.
In the country, Ide, the corruption of Russia costs more than $300 billion per year.
The country is organized to place 154 a newer investigation for global integration of corruption by the non-national transparency organization (the countries are listed by "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt".
The enth-release of the Memos of the Moscow message, which happened after the evening of Moscow, will be able to solve securely disasters within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, that it may also be a possibility for the creml to be able to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and who reacted to the enthity that the Ananian diplomates called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is a major responsibility for the internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we hadn't expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront the past
In a weak, betoned class room with smuggling and bleeding walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School refers to the man who built him to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here's Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," Sung Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge Government, the commander remains in the former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of ancient soldiers still live.
However, this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge capital against the Government, long-year attachments are requested in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and divorce allowed the victims to be publicly confronted with people who only supported the regime.
In June, the Government distributed a school book that for the first time the children of ancient soldiers told the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community Officer of the UN and Cambodja first condemned a former member of Khmer Rouge when he condemned the former leader of the Tuol Sleng folter room, Kaing Khek Iev, better than duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these developments, the most of the Khmer Rouge Veteran Alnlong Vengs increased, strengthened their efforts to reintegrate and reintegrate into the Cambodge Society.
"There is still a delay and in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation room of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of the wicked."
"They're splitting themselves families."
During the Khmer Rouge Government in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1,7 million people have been executed or died in diseases, processing or hunger.
When the Vietnamese inhibited and the Pol Pot-Ied government was destroyed in 1979, the rest of the Regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodja to Thailand.
Here they broadcast up until December 1998, when the last movement was moved, disturbed.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of Guerilla from their base in the west of the mountains and dschungel of Cambodja, Ta Mok moved to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the United Nations in 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to go over to the Government, which led to the chapter of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 with a natural death, and Ta Mok, who did not follow, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his process.
When their guests had no longer split, the most ancient Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the murdering poverty of the rural Cambodge and many kept the move in nostalgic memory.
Even if some of Khmer Rouge's few elite officers held their local government posts because they laid their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uninstructed builders.
"These people have only benefited very little from the capital," said Sok Leang from the center for justice and destruction, which holds public fores in the entire Kambodsha, even in Anlong Veng,
"They are enhanced in the Utopic Agriculturalology of the Regime."
"They're growing up without any professional knowledge."
Lim, 55 years old, who had been joined as a teenager of the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fighted in Dschungel about Anlang Veng before he left in 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveller.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we need to care for ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Court has also raised anxiety here.
In the next year, the Court will try to judge Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The Court's mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the crimes, but it is not said whether there will be other acts other than these four cases.
This has little pleasure to worry the oldest in Anlong Veng.
Current media inspectors have been concurred on In Chaem, 64 years, which was a district headfine in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge Government during the late 1970s.
2007 she had told the officers of the documentation area of Cambodja, leading the building of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of workers were probably dead.
On a heavy evening, in Chaem, the work on the fields came back to their woods on a swimming street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun's long shadow on the dark grass, in Chaem, refused to discuss about their past at Khmer Rouge.
If the court offers her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodscha le ́ in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are no persecutions anymore, it would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is in 1878 from the Khmer Rouge, has also warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would accuse more convinced, though experts and historicals discuss this.
"Cambodscha must bury a lock and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Kambodsha must do to be able to go forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentation area.
"Freeting with the Khmer Times means combined with the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our obligation to join these broken parts so that they can understand everything."
The Centre created the first school book approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-lateral "History of the Democratic Cambodge".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an attachment to the History Book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodja young people in Anlong Veng know just little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the town's connections to regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand a major part of their story.
But his parents reacted skepticly when he had the book with home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are misstrauishing because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such a resistance makes the departure process complex and complicated, said Sok Lang.
But the public fores, the school book and the court are reached after and after the influence," he said.
There is still the Khmer Rouge here a powerful relationship.
Top in the Dangrek Mountains leads one of the stars overwhelming and with plastic rubbered road to a black road corner, covered with a rose bleach.
Pol Pots body was burned here after death 1998 on a roofhouse.
Nuum Sothea, 31 years old, a phone seller at the road border, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pots the last holiday, where she's going to put a bush on the bananes - in the hope he's bringing her happiness.
white Russia is therefore agreed to collect non-armable Uran
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global security of nuclear materials, the Government of Belarus announced the middle-week that there is no longer a higher enough Uran, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was given in a common statement after a meeting of the foreign minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the white-russian foreign minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security box.
The US government had been trying for a year to convince white Russia to collect no longer high enough uran and seemed to have reached a hit last year.
However, officials of the US Government told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements with white Russia were met to remove 187 pounds of armable Uran from a white-russian research.
This prepared for the middle-week convention to remove the material - a official worker who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the theme, about 500 pounds.
The Agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Normal Safety Guide of 47 N" from April, which had excluded white Russia.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next golf of 2012.
"I was really amazed by the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear security box (from 2012)."
"This proves me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of white Russia.
Obama spoke in April 2009 in Prague to ensure all the pregnant nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US Government has helped six countries to get their high enough Uran.
White Russia will be the seventh.
A thousand countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Guide, the white Russian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation would never be released to its Uran.
"How to keep high enough Uran - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally weaponable, and less enough Uran," said Lukehenko at that time.
"This is our rubber... we're not going to make any crazy bombs, and we'll not survive it to anyone."
"We're using it outside for research, that's all."
However, white Russia approached the United States a few months ago when it was interested in meeting an agreement.
The first approach to remove the Uran white-russland in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily radiated, say of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was downloaded in a special train, which is more than 1.300 miles to a Russian storage and deprivation factory for, says of holding.
The second arrival was closed on Monday and the officers were carried out by a flight.
The US government pays for these efforts $14 million, whereas a majority of the money flows into the white-russian research with weakened uran which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and voted to build confidence," which led to the agreement under which Clinton had been understood, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Minister, who is at the global reduction.
The James Martin Centre for non-distributors estimates that white-russland had at least 88 pounds of armed urans in this year, as well as hundreds of pounds at high enough uran.
white Russia wants to solve its store until 2012 by the Common Agreement.
The relationships between white Russia and the United States have been stressed for years, in the first line because of the harsh disappointment of human rights.
But the statement of the middleweek suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is very welcome to the United States of America and white Russia, that a higher respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central subject in the improvement of bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No convictions of the Spanish Government against flights
The Spanish Government had no convictions against the flights with the Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over the Spanish State region to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of the US Messenger in Madrid.
This reflects the further documents made by Wikileaks and the "El País" journal. It is indicated that the former Governing Boss María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested the Spanish Government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircrafts are monitored properly."
In June 2006, after publishing a report from the Council of Europe, where the aid to human rights-related practices was accused of a thousand countries, including Spain, the former Northern American advocate Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Governing Boss of Justice admitted that the report of the Council "have found Zapatero in the opinion" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined, Spain has no conviction against the secret service flights on the Spanish State area."
"You just want to be informed," not "unprepared", reports Aguirre per kabel.
In addition to the former foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, the speaker pointed out that the Spanish Government would "not want to give great attention to this matter, although the Government had only little influence, because they were in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the State lawyer Vicente González made the message understanding that he would not block the judicial initiatives, the Declassi-Declaration of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defence Minister on Flights.
"These reports contain no chargeable or sensitive information," said the rapporteur after an interview with the State lawyer.
However, the United States were more concerned about the "visual coordination between the Spanish State Advocate and the German State Affairs" than about the declassizered information of the CNI and the Defence Minister.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts for discrete management between governments," Aguirre recalls.
At a mid-day in March 2007, in which the Officer of the United States and the Spanish Internal Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, recently commented that "although the Spanish judges were aware of their independence and did eat what they had to be added to," he gave his employees instructions to avoid ritorical comments to delay the spending."
The rapporteur also expressed his concern on the procedures of the PP in this matter.
"With its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt about the fact that the Government of Zapateros of the United States acts that could be expressed as possible human rights damage, tolerated or increasingly ignored, will be caused by capital, even if these enthries could affect negatively the Government of the United States."

In order to understand these, it is necessary to know their loved life that the ABC day period rebuild on the basis of their family members’ declarations.
The 30-year-old Gallic woman took a relationship with Ivan Tuñez, a industrialist.
She held a year.
Soon after she had solved her relationship, she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his husband never allowed him to perform a DNA analysis.
Soon she entered another relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousam, a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balears to look at the work, the young man stayed with her partner, who even attended her for a week to Palma.
But from the contents of their messages, they can conclude that their love relationship was distracted and they separated themselves.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and writes, "Alberto is very own and sad because I came to work."
"When I told him this, he found it good, but now he knows what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to do what he wants."
Later she adds a message that she just received on the phone, "I want you to come back this month or let me get a address to which I can send you the boy."
She's sorry, "If he doesn't like me to leave the boy with my mother, I'll take him away when I'm back."
In May, she says about the back in her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll stay until 19th, because I have to imagine myself at 20th work if I don't want to lose them."
She explains she takes her firstborn when everything's fine.
"He will be with whom he must be, that means, with me. I will never leave him again with someone other than my mother," a doubtful purpose when you consider their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes this, the boy, who came to the island on 1st of the month and was likely killed on 10th, is dead.
"Everyway, Caesar is satisfied, no one."
"And on the other side, he's with me and the place he likes a little, but on the other hand he must go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"Then he (the boy) will visit a summary source, so I have less detailes for the child's neighborhood."
On 17: Reminders and claims.
"A riesencus of Caesar who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he has sent me any videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me so crazy."
On 30th, "The boy's fine. He's going to a summary to learn catalytic."
From Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are communications from her.
She had even a own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called her "Muki, the prison lasser".
"Terror a la gallega (overwrite)."
The latter man who lived with her, a simplified overseer, explains to have a consciousness because he feels guilty.
He can't think that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was all kind of a mother.
Monica was transferred from the center of court prisoners to Menorca in the prison of Palma last night.
The obligation defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that they could not be reminded of the end of the business preservation, "and they didn't have the intention to add to the small damage."
Nevertheless, before, she had been able to hurt Caesar in the bathroom and to have found his body in a cave.
Defence and State advocate requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular wined 4 sits in the Congress, and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
According to the significant vote and deputy growth in the last regional elections, the PP is already guided to the elections of the Parliament or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has made for these elections is usually doubled as the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalogue Popular Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 Parliamentary elections, while this number was only 316.222 in 2006.
On the last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this increased tendence - the result of the review of the voting share of the PSC and the binding of the election of the PP - the analysers of the PP prognoze that the PPC could grow from 8 to 12 Congress Deputy, while the Ciu four (he now has 10) and would lose at least 9 Members (from 25).
These claims indicate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the Popular Party, the ERC would lose a lawyer - now it has three - while ICV holds her lawyers or could win one of them.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date with the assembly elections in May 2011. The peoplesparty (PP) can also be the tongue in the Waage to prepare the socialist predecessor, although in four provincies and with its majority in the city Council of Barcelona, one of the urban administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
As the nationalists and the peoples party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists cannot gain a majority or return to their traditional associates (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debate, it is not desirable that this party will lose its representation in the United States of Barcelona, in which it must achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP decreased a growth of its voting share in the four provinces and could become a decisionable force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to play the main role in Tarragonas, where they ruled before the present citizen, Joseph Félix Ballesteros, with the PP.
A Lérida is the PP only 500 voices behind the PSC. The citizen master, Angel Ros, has discussed relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election battle they met several times.
Even in other important places, such as in Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus, the peoples party could have a significant growth.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 citizen administrations in Catalonia and stressed the education of lists in many places as possible.
The Catalogue Cell, Al Qaida, concerned thousands of travellers
Besides the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the Secret Services of the Police of Barcelona, Pakistanians and Nigerianians, adopted by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the " movement to free from Tamil Eelam" and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Lat) - last was the author of the Attentate in Bombay, which requested 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Internal Minister shows that these investigations are significant, which is so far to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" of the Al Qaidas falsification apparatus has been "deteriorated" throughout the world and "their activity".
The researchers conclude that in the two years when the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where these age and then to the groups from which the criminal galaxie Al Qaida was combined, so that their "fighters" could not exceed the limits of more and more western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only of the dschhadist network that was active in Europe, but it is why other police units have been involved in the investigations other than the Thailand research bodies; it is not to be excluded that there will be similar attents in the EU area in the next days as the previous month in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pacific Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) was held in Thailand, where Pakistanians were arrested Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thailand Sighelaya Kijbum.
They led from Bangkok from the cells left in Spain and other countries.
The catalyst network - a part of it was destroyed in 2009 - stole tourist passes in accordance with the terms of the "International Islam Front".
This means that the documents on the names of men between 25 and 45 years of age have to be valid, and they have not been able to show a visa stempel.
In the research areas, no connections could be demonstrated in Catalonia and the attachment in Bombay until now, although the author of this Attentats was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipients of the Spanish and then in Thailand.
However, it should be noted that a few days before the attent of Catalonia from a financial transfer undertaking were sent several thousands, which were "invested" in the purchasing of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which later used by the members of the "Commandos", which had been prepared for a final life of 106 people.
The police has taken an amazing documentation.
PP requests by Mas a meeting of the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, was the opportunity to present its conditions to support its office as the President of the Generality, which are not different from those already made during the election battle and are able to meet with the priority of the economic rehabilitation and the submission of regionalist independence agencies, such as a financial balance agreement that the regional leader wants to propose at the extent of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalogue Popular Party, with the security of Artur Mas, which granted you the 18 deputy who had won the last Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to feel inappropriate, because the candidate from the Ciu-Regionist Partie is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties contains the vote at the vote of the vote.
The future covenants that the regionalists want to enter into the coming Parliamentary elections in the Congress depend on a possible entity with the PP. However, the talk that takes the mass of time with the rest of the parties turns to Catalonia.
As regards the PPC's chairman, it requests that, in support of the "all talks relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and a agreement on the financial balance between State and the autonomous region - like in Basqueland - and even the Participant of Ciu would like to submit a referendum.
Both political leaders are common to make the developed political equipment of the regional administration swimming and to deduct the inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the Office of Mass are employed by the PPC Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will be gathered with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Manufacturer confirms that death cases are not to be rejected to "false measures"
The owner of the Olot's owner doesn't exclude that her wedding killed over 11 elderly people
The responsibles of La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference last night, in which they expressed the damage of crime action Joan Vila Dilmés - the penitent who had killed at least 11 old people who were responsible for his work - had granted the establishment.
The leader of the senior officer, Joan Sala, stood in execution of his advocate, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the death cases)," but "the right and our obligation of detaining forces us to make the process and civil detention".
The institution must not only take a social consideration loss because it had not temporarily detected the criminal acts of the person, but now also put a high sum of compensation calculated by the representatives of the family members of the victim.
Joan Vila Dilmé said that the first crime returned to August 2009 and that he had been killed since.
The judge ordained the exhibition of eight body - former patients in the old administration home - because he believed that no Ar^ had personally investigated the disturbances, but the formalities of their age and diseases were phonely developed.
The leader of La Caritat declined this point around and explained that "the remaining measures could never have been the reason for the events."
La Caritat's legal lawyer adds that "in the courts there are no indices for conductable actions of a person other than the accused one."
The Baptized "Death Angel" already stood before the morning eleven murders and explained that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and killed the second old lady one half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in the subsequent of the first crime, where he had taken a mixture of different preparations.
The leader of La Caritat explained that the staff's access to medicines is only difficult to control.
Insulin splits and the cocktail of treatment, the petroleum introduced six of nine crimes in order to deliver the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the lab research will be determined whether Vila l' and for his first victims had actually chosen a less grass death or whether he burned them from inner, by providing them blackly, as he had soundly done in three women that he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat there is no faith in the statement of the prosecutor, not even in the number of killings that could be more. This option is justified by the fact that Vila has made very different statements before the court and that it does not make any sense to change his procedure after eight hours.
They say that they were available for this reason and for the establishment of the government of these cases of justice.
The European Central Bank (BCE)
The investors reacted to the drafting of the ECB President Trichet last night, which warned, "the markets should not underestimate our responsibilities."
The risk impacts of the Euro peripherian countries are dramatic and the actions of the banks are more than 5%.
Yet, we should not underscore the possibility that the ECB can disturb himself and that the euro has lacked up to points that are concerned.
The events of yesterday are typically for an illicit market, which is recovered, however, due to the closement of shorter and high speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose its best longer.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank invited us to reject our liquidity issues, which the ECB must make a backward tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably a few times in the future.
The Bundesbank requested the end of the plan for the purchase of State debts, as they were ineffective, and the derogation of all exceptional liability measures, which should be maintained only a weekly unexpected access.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least to the market" and keep the four-year statements with unlimited access to the quarter end to ensure liquidity until June.
We also expect the program to purchase Oblig's and to make an enhanced signal.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, the exciting reaction of the markets will be restored from yesterday and if it is sustained to the retention of our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Similarly, as at the ECB's session in May, when the Bank confirmed not taking into consideration the buying of State debt papers and joining the markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be reliable and sustainable.
In May, she showed the teeth, and in the middle of the week she said that she had already cooked much, which caused her a new market breakdown.
The auktion of a yearly state titles in Portugal was very weak.
The State capacity management was only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
However, the rates in Portugal fell about 30 base points in the whole curve and thus reflected a change in markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the numbers of the debt of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The amount will be estimated for approximately 10 000 million short-term and more 15 000 more. There is time until February to get a private capital or to be established by these banks.
While Ireland has completely lost his credibility after it has not recognised the problem with the stress test in July, the numbers are acceptable and helped to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the Government must receive the parliamentary approval to a new budget on the next Sunday, since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made its discourse on 14 December on the board of the Government and of the Government moderate. There is a political unit requested to show that we together play the same party.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries are the nine Sinfonie Beethovens.
The Spanish Government President proposed yesterday the action plan to be adopted on Friday by the Ministerial Council.
Reform of pensions, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, the degradation of the State debt, the liberalisation, the employment and the employment measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish bourses have added to 4.5 Pro.
In comparison to February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was quickly and convinced, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a major increase in a three-year state facility that will benefit from the trichet effect, so we put on a strong request that will eliminate all doubts of our ability to acquire.
For Spain, the request for a plan of assistance would be a self-off sacrifice.
We would receive the likvidity we don't need. The tax collection has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in the market. The rates are too closed and the access to the markets would be untimely closed.
Nevertheless, our holdings should respond to the Motto Caesar's wife, "Now is not just the number of his, but also the sight."
Just courage, we can do it!
The President of Eulen, on request of his children, invited the company assembly of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Alvarez, owner of the Company Eulen and El Enebro, does not decline.
David Álvarez, the foundation of the company, will advise the company assembly of El Enebro, which will be found at the request of five of his seven children on 16th place, because he holds them "absolutely unnecessary". His children will try to receive a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - inhaber of the Weinguts Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary José, prepare the legal measures for a new capital of justice in their fight against the control of a part of the company group.
The main main holding of business services does not seem to be ready to monitor the control of the organs of El Enebro.
It was issued from the Governing Council by five of his seven children, which were appointed to the Actionary Assembly of 18 January this year, which has already been invoked to the Commercial Governor as a member of the Administrative Council.
The company assembly of El Enebro, invited by the Court of Commerce No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has issued a new penalty in the family of Alvarez.
The appointment of the Court to appoint the congregation is the only legal way that ensures the integration of the company assembly.
The latest of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz is made by David Alvarez as a "dumped means of the applicant - his five children - to be recognized by legal deficiencies, fraudulent powers and legal misuse of the congregation of 18 January", as official speakers.
This argument is the basis for the assembly's campaign in the nearby to declare it as " absolutely unnecessary".
The same protagonists who are in discrete weaknesses have tried to call a congregation in June in a legal way.
At El Enebro - Company and Inhaber of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, along with other assets - David Álvarez controls seven children 100 Pro of the capital.
However, the reasoning of the Service Group requires family protocols to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the background of the matter that the judges have decided on the treatment of the campaign for which no date has yet been established.
Red Bull sees in the F1 with a secret weapons of Siemens
The cars are improved in real time with a software.
Since Red Bull 2004 is introduced into the world of the form 1, their history has been introduced in this reading universe of speed of surprises and success.
At first, no one gave newly observed and despite his steel growing advances during the last season, all put on the winning of Fernando Alonso Fernando's Ferraris.
Without intending to replace the ability of the German pilot and the World Master Sebastian Vettel or the power force of Renault's engine, it is the " secret weapons", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a victory team, became legend.
It is actually a strong software for the simulation of processes aimed at the 2007 German company that do not have authors on the market.
This PLM information programme was used for the development of mounting chats in manufactures worldwide, energy works and high-accurate tools.
A reliable reproduction or simulation of a product or process will be made before it is actually built to avoid such errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous use vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, leader of the Industrial Department of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in formula 1 - Fabrik Red Bull "in few hours, almost in real time" can create and perform the changes and improvements found on running and tests.
Russwurm concluded that 1992 was a median technology in the Rennes which could introduce at least three or four improvements in a season.
In Red Bulls team, 180 high-qualities young people are employed today. With powerful EDV facilities they conduct analyses and all possible changes to the road car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the components of the Renault cars of Red Bull, except the engine for which Renault is responsible for.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements will be changed.
The changes may be transferred to the reality within less than 24 hours from the reality of the simulator, thanks to progressive production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limits set for this stupid technical perfectionism are the 40 million, which can issue a form 1 - team for his trains in a season.
Red Bull has built his hightech factory for the development and manufacture of his cars in a 50 miles away from London.
It is two buildings in which search - especially journalists - are strongly limited.
Everything happens there is the top secret.
The holding includes 580 persons, of the two pilots, the worldmaster Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls of the real form 1 - Held is uncertainly the newest world master Sebastian Vetell.
Without the great resources that the Energy drinking manufacturer provides in the services of his participation in the ring lines, other protagonists are hidden, whose support is unapprovalable and their knowledge is equal to zero.
The Technology Boss of the Work, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago, you could say that the progress in the F&E area of Renning Cars with 50 Pro^ to win and the pilots were responsible for the responsibility.
Today the share values have changed. Technology is 85% of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15%.
Nevey recognises that Vettels and Webbers can never be replaced by EDV because they are "not predictable Gladiators".
HP is opened with local distributors in twenty years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) last night, in Barcelona, invited his first exclusive loads in collaboration with partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of the 20-year marketing networks with a total of 80-100 square metres, which intends to open the multi in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees with these initiatives with the already existing 16 marketing areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, called for example the converted loads at the Gran Via in Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with the HP for 30 years.
The North American Company Group intends to set up 200 sales in Europe until 2010, from 20 downloads in Spain.
The first weeks were shown in Bukarest (Romany) and ́rad (Serbia). Barcelona is the business.
Mr Herrera didn't want to deliver the future openings, but it did not conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The representative president, who is also leader of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy is always equal to the opening of the laden. She is on a local supplier with experience and breeding knowledge.
The North American Company Group relates to this and takes the exclusive load emission (with interactive products) in Europe.
HP is responsible for the training of the laden staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a Franchising system and highlighted that the exclusive purchasing network was observed, "the customer service and the advice of small and small enterprises when they were purchased and then, even to optimize the packages."
The loading in Barcelona is based on a pillar pilot program that provides the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee l.
A online series builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holand).
"In this way, we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small enterprises, as well as for customers, because the major companies have already been contracting their technical customer service contracts yesterday," said Helena Herroro.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years of a million customers 'know'
The employee member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than another manager. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but it will lead to a new liquidity crisis and prophesy the end of the debt war.
However, it provides a breakdown of rates to try to compare the banks with increased taxes and the prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to start a million seconds in three years - a more existing range.
Sabadell has found the way to expose the next three years, and so to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guide plan 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without taking the public aid from the FROB, but also the market share of a million seconds - 700 000, if you turn away from the customers that will lose the bank -, this is the great challenge that this bank is before, because it has even given more attention to its business offices than their own customers.
In this year, it has reached 250 000 seconds and 50 000 companies.
Their market share is at 3,5 Pro, while the business skills are more than 10 Pro.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the growth of the product, speaking exterity, cost reduction. The challenges that the bank faces will be presented together with the annual final report.
Only a few banks are able to set objectives and to publish in these difficult times, since all the plans of the banks have been made throughout the world.
Sabadell will conclude its leading plan for four years ago, which was initially exposed to three years, but according to the marketing plan he was extended in a business year.
The customers left the sparcase are the main goal of the bank.
On one of the APIE organized breakfasts, Guardiola, 2011, would be a "swak" year "with a great rich west".
The Manager is going to say that Spain's only "slow" out of the crisis.
It would be "very difficult" in two or three years to "create work" - basically for the survival of the banks.
Even if it concludes that the war for passives - which will punish the price margins - will be punished, the risks, banks and sparcases for their emissions for the acquisition of liquidity, as a compensation for accelerating profits will already be worth the price of credits.
"The subjects of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exercise the pressure of the credits."
"We didn't turn the hain, but the rate differences are very high," Guardiola told.
On Thursday, Banesto had already expressed the order on its network to reduce the delivery of long-term loans and to increase the rate differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks now followed the stategies to "crease the taxes," but "inside one of the frameworks imposed by the competition."
Sabadell's leader plan is based on a organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate businesses.
He is not able to make sure that in Spain "the greater companies are needed."
"The next year everything will change," he assured.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "increasing" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be cut off in red numbers.
It is the opinion that FROB can replace the money in capital rates.
After he assured that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he strengthened the argument of some bankers who already prophesied a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be able to run, but in the subsequence of the events in June, you can achieve short-term financing on repeated businesses and thus delay the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion source of sparcase
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed the possibility of bringing to a Fusional Source of Sparcases and stressing the difficulty with which the branch is restructured.
When the Concerning Process of Spanish Sparkassen started, several sparcasses were not shared in the first phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassen Connection (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, would not be paid.
"I think most of the fusions has been completed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Civica group cannot be considered as the second, it was more than adjustments."
"The majority has been completed. It may be that we have in place of seventy-five or four, but all important processes have already been completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, who has supported all the works."
In one of the organized Fridays organized by the business leader and manager of Aragoniens (ADEA), Olavarrieta concluded that the consolidation process was "complete as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the periodic expiration, which in previous times, not now, in the framework of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition of 45 sparcasses with a average of 28,000 million powers to 17 with 75,500 million is a historical incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 per cent and they are now much greater than we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta explained: "There were a number of uncomfortable opinions about the long-term process that opened inseries and insensitiveness," because "Banco de España urges us to end the time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, guaranteed yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems of Europe and the "much" of the world and supplemented that those who doubt this "without deeper knowledge".
The Manager noted that in the current economic communication we must make "no concern" on the situation of the financial institutions and the sparcases, which have passed through a "very significant" concertation process, which will be completed as soon as possible.
He also noted that the Spanish banks had the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time conditions for the entire European Union.
The spending on the markets has made a double response of the Government.
On the other hand, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, starting in tax reductions for small and small enterprises, regulating time-making enterprises or repealing 426 euros for unemployed unemployed, until 49% of AENA, the management of the Airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State lottery.
On the other hand, the Governing Boss Elena Salgado, with the help of the former President of the Government Felipe González, supports the criticism of the officer Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these actions to understand?
It is expected that the label position is not their public work error.
In contrast, it is a new responsibility in the weak process of redefinition of the euro.
In this context, Germany takes a basic new perspective for the creation of our future, which co-lines with the maintenance of the older traditions of a large part of his partner.
As regards Europe's opposition, in Germany it is to speculate three possible outcomes from the crisis.
First: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro.
The second: Recommendation of the German Mark - despite the currently sounds more after Science Fiction - , supported by a majority of the public opinion, approximately 50 Pro · the population.
Third: a restructuring of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means more economic control; strong budget management; punishment of the countries which are under the rules; possible payment sets of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has gone from some time, therefore there are no expressions now.
First of 2009, both the IWF and the European Commission were invited to debietes, and the German Government took a constitutional reform from the army to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign for the exemption between what Germany considered necessary (star fiscal plans and stable public funds) and the practices of his partner, France.
The second character set the Mediterranean country, as a label, the decision to save Greece was painfully exhausted.
At that time, it was criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and public opinion, was absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
It calls for a reform of the Agreements of the European Union to enable a country's salvation and to bind the private loans to a part of the costs.
This position was expressed as an anti-equipment, since it was introduced by the Irish crisis and the following.
However, its proposal was adopted, even though it was proposed, and in the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which will allow these measures since 2013.
Germany has made a red line that doesn't think of it too much.
It tells everyone that, even if the measures need to be taken now, it will no longer be the former function of the euro from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new village, in which the other countries will be severely punished, forced to declare payment incapable and, in this case, the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to put a strong growth course, with high spending and investment rates, meditation of consumption, improvement of the product and competitiveness, as well as positive external sales.
The other alternatives, which are based on debt and buildings with large lakes in the payment bi, as indicated by Spain in trees, will simply not be taken.
The boat is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand it.
It is not only that the State department runs up to the year 2013 to three pro.
The requests are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to hurt ourselves.
I hope the current turbulences are going over in more peace.
And that we will use the possibilities that we will be offered until early 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understanded this, and his double announcement (the pronounced reforms after the meeting with the large companies last week and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) shows that, despite the criticism of labels, the hypothesis, the order in his own house has been prepared.
But the red line held by Germany is there, and it doesn't seem that something would change it.
In view of the possibilities, we should not leave the Eurospace completely stopped with small series of countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and rules
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show finding spirit, but not the desire to handle a sanction.
The exclusion of two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in that many tents were lost about whether it was an unportuous action or not and whether both players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As general, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (your team had already been clearly winning) time and played several fools to show them the second yellow map.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfil the previously written sanction in the next game against the axer and so without cards will enter into the next game phase.
The EUFA's disciplinary committee punished the tree of the Club, José Mourinho, with two games and the shared players with different amounts of money.
The provokation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is often to take place in the world of football.
It is so far spread that it is part of the ethos - the unscriptural, but in this sports type -.
A part of the debate on the present case is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which was punished in his hymne Edelmut and honor and, in other occasions, his players for similar events) played the main role, and the dramatization by Mourinho, which had more a episode to his long history than theatric and operating technicians.
In any case, the debate regards whether this not expressly prohibited behaviour is contrary to the principles of the sport, which means whether these actions represent a regulation; actually, these procedures consider the statues of the sport, but it seems to be aware of it.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the corporate integrity of the opposers, a aspect that was not assigned by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a pure game is to avoid that the players continue to take an unrighteous benefit from the opposite team. This did not even happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand under false games or regulations, because the environment has not been secretly complete to avoid a sanction, but it should be as adequate as possible to be punished by the judge.
The players waited and took the sanction pleasantly.
Another question is what kind of advantage the contractors from the reflective Fouls .
Here should be highlighted that the rival wasn't brought into a more unnecessary situation or benefits for the game played, because the evident result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with less players.
It is also no useful Property for the next game, because the club is then not over these players.
The benefit is obviously that the players start the next game phase of Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation to a future game.
But it's a long-term, up to a certain degree of undesirable benefit, since the team could sometimes separate. Property players receive a sanction with this procedure and go into the second card cycle, where they separate a card with a card less than in the first cycle.
This is not so clear whether it is really a benefit.
Finally, such procedures are not against the sports spirit, which also belong to strategic decisions to take greater benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players didn't want to handle sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rulership), they wanted to choose better when they undertaken it.
They took a strategy decision without being punished or fled from her.
Although the limit between the finding and the regulatory environment is limited, I think it is a clear case of discovery.
I have the impression that the polymetic has occurred due to two of them: because it was about two self-exemptions and because of the type of processed rule transfer.
The damage that has been attributed to the principles of the sport by these actions is less ethical than much more ethical.
Bootofensive to customer starting for groups of dinner dinners in Barcelona
The dictature of the calendar allows this year a lavine of reservations to fall on the day 16 and 17 December.
The holidays paid by employees themselves are spread. They don't want to expire more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like Turron and the Wednesday lottery, there are again group nights in the Previously, which will bring to Barcelona's guest and free time purchase of sugar. However, according to the economic crisis, they solve a price-official in order to include the customer segment that represents the large mass: at least everyone wants to educate between 20 and 30 euros for a midday or evening, visit the requested undertakers and associates.
In order to make the booking a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has allowed all orders to fall in the week of 13 December, with the result of a lawine of reservations of dinners at two hours (16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week ago.
Since 2008, when the bad times started, many enterprises have set the groups out of budgetary funds.
In order not to dismiss this tradition, many employees pay them from their own bag.
Like the conjunction too, it is requested for low prices, the president of the Guest Gremium of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the deck band is not expected to predict how the festival will be seen in this month.
"The people overlook it forty times before they reserve."
"You want to go out, but they look strongly at the prices," he says.
The business will be good for those who " offer the quality to good prices with a good service" and calls us to remember that the customers are safeguarded in crisis times, so prices will be highly requested for 25 euros.
In a question in various central residents, the evening of 17 December leads the provider to Collaps.
The Soteras Group states that the requests for this Friday, with a view to issue less than 30 euros, would be trees. The group has adjusted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the conjuncture.
In another leading group, Andilana, who holds 16 guests in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other), has led the property of the calendar to preserve, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the pre-year prices with menus for each shadow of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
In the group, El Mussol, Attic, Quu and in total 23 locals, you do not lose the optimism, after the second quarter of the second quarter, the income is rebuilding and good, even though in a few days it has been able to see the views of the holiday business.
The sources of the company group show that the 18th day will be an overactive day with friends who preach the nights.
The six group menus have been added to a winter menu for 30 euros or more than preishit. The customers have the impression that they are ready to provide more than 10 per per cent than in the previous year and want more details, for example, Cava.
Even in some companies, you see green sprays, so the employees will be invited again, which gives the impression that the groupnesses are again in exhibition.
On the side of the Dachband Fecasarm (with combinations such as the kneipen, aurant and free time association of Barcelona), the president's enemy president, En ́ Gomaà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are in total "live", although the customers "exhibit a maximum".
But the pleasure of the festival has not gone back, anybody pays.
The Pacific Nuclear Program has great concern in the United States
Islamabad makes atomic weapons "faster than any other country".
Enth’s relations between the Taliban and Pakistan are involved by Wikileaks.
The content of the correspondence between the northern American message in Pakistan and the United States Department enth of the Internetportal Wikileaks, which provides great concerns with the Pakistan atmosphere Washington.
At the border of the cloud and sat details that provide the documents on the contents of the talks and the thoughts of the accredited northern American diplomats in Islamabad, they enthusiast that cooperation between both countries in atomic matters is not strengthened but "absorpted" and that the instable Asian country makes more atomic weapons "for a quicker rytme than any other country".
In addition to the property of the Pakistanian Atomic Programme - that the weapons are not compiled, but are stored their individual parts in order to harm their screening at a possible attack - prepare Washington without sleeping nights.
The following risks are recorded by the advocate in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the former leader of the National Security Council, James Jones, on: "The nearby of some atomic installations to the area attacked by the Taliban, the mutual spread of the nuclear material and the accident of transport of nuclear material."
The large number of persons involved in the nuclear harmony and racket programmes will be considered not only by the United States but also by Russia as exhaustive and reasonable.
"Pakistan needs to set a strictly believed staff to monitor atmosphere; due to the low educational and cultural level, extremist organizations have more opportunities to reclute persons who cooperate with atomic or racket programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Minister in a meeting with his northern American colleagues.
The new documentation by Julian Assanges Internetportal enth is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in nuclear broadcast matters and the increased time in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a Office of the message described as "fruiting" is explained: "There is often no transparency; we don't receive answers or are rejected on help offers."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, is that "in contrast to the economic disastrous Pakistan atmosphere produces atomic weapons as quickly as no other country."
The advocate Patterson requests Washington during a major military leadership, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "claim" the responsibility that "Pakistan's Army has to set his quietness on the execution of terrorist groups."
On the jail to Wikileak's Chief
Obama calls a high responsibility for the anti terrorism fight to prevent new enthries.
Interpol shows a red warning of persecution and discovery of assange.
All that relates to Wikileaks and its reasoner, Juigean Assange, constitutes a complicated labyrinth, where things are only difficult to discover.
In the morning, Interpol showed a "rode warning" to the "affiliation and persecution" of the assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrangement to be adopted.
She's not new, she's coming from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the latest enthing of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual misuse which the most need to be in Sweden.
Moreover, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assured, "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
On 20th, the international police officer with Sitz in Lyon (France) issued the order on request of Switzerland, but it was not given by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receipt of the power.
The 188 interpol countries are ordered to identify and find assange "to keep and deliver it temporarily."
Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of a person concerned with a red warning, many Member States consider the red warning as a free letter for arrest - which the national police must be carried out - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange remains possible.
The action was appealed by Assenge's advocates who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old reasoner of Wikileaks was ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also note that Assange requested the outcome from Sweden and from the State Awaltin, which would be compared with the Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the Safety Chair of Stalin, which received the appropriate authorisation.
"This is like a jail, not as a legal persecution," it is accused of writing.
As the world is looking for him - and his mother is deceived from the innocentness of her son - Assange stands on an unknown place, but it is not difficult.
On Monday, he gave the leader of the magazine Time per Skype from an unusual place from an interview and requested the return of the State Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the order of North America's diplomats to spy the United Nations and thus committed international agreements under the United States," he said.
His opinion was sentenced by the president secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, yesterday, who subjected the request to retreat as "laughing and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he explained to the CNN sender.
Obama himself has assigned a high responsibility for the anti terrorism fight, Russell Travers, to prevent new documents.
The trial of the President Barack Obama's speaker to give less attention is in contrast with the opinions that are reporting conservatives and commentators in these days.
The Congress Deputy Peter King, who will lead to the president in the National Security Committee of the Deputy House since January, has requested the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to take their money and to follow everyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, counselor of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still gone, and he had to revoke his statement, Assange must be killed.
"Obama had to transform him into a target chain and use an unmounted aircraft or something like that."
He who was not excused was Mike Huckabee, baptism minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever has always been who has given information in the Government, he is guilty of the constitution and all that is not fitting is too mild penalty," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós seeks with an eyewitch to Carod Nearby peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the Partie to vote secretly on its holding in the Official Journal.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a receipt to get out of the way for the seventh time of an internal rearranger in the series of 11 lawyers and the help of the electoral voices.
The Chairman of the Parties is aware that his refreshment is not sufficient to the neighbors of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is so weak today as its mentor himself and will not protect the same headbreak as other former streams.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra trys to win the new criticians with an eye-winner, which would ensure its position until the next communal choices.
In the beginning, the over 200 regional Council members of the ERC could express his residence in the Office secretly.
With election notes, not with high-handed hands.
If the carodists wanted to prevent the president's penalty, they would have to do this to protect without repressing.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of splitting as well as the impression of submission under his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel with the help of the votes plus one unemployed, and he would be able to add without indicating proef values, a result of "in Bulgarian style" would not be good.
The Carod Neighbors ask the President more than only the party to provide its office, which is inadequate because Puigcercós controls the top organ of the Congress.
However, since they have no sufficient majority to force retractions, they will agree with the proposal for a procedure plan from now to May.
Therefore, they expect to be able to contribute to the development of the Strategic Reorientation Document that the guidance will be presented to the Council on 18th vote.
Its purpose is to be for Puigcercós. In contrast, this will promise to present the Congress in Herbst 2011, which the party is already considered to be a >.
The President of the ERC is the opinion that the "polyphonia" has damaged the stability and he strives for every time to bring the organization into ability to wash their waves behind the closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official Conseller Josep Huguet in 日 Blog is symptomatic.
In view of the idea that Puigcercos is a ideology, the inherent of innovation believed that the Chairman of Parties would be based on the "switch against different goals".
He numbered five, two of whom two are in front.
First, the "restructuring" of the representative so that this is at least 90% of the party members, which means the integration of new viewers from Carods environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally indicate the full collectionprin.
In this context, he distorted a reform of the statutes to allow the congress with the selected delegates.
From the end of the complete assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercos' team, which has already been in the last two congresss, as it is.
In fact, the Implementation of the Parties in 2008 has been assigned to a congress that should be discussed with the reform of the statutes.
This appointment still states that the income of the internal exhibition of the last years was not rare.
Now, without the critical sectors, the time could have come to take this matter back and end forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce the gas gas reduction
The representative of China explained on the COP16, his country has great efforts to reduce the carbon traces and it would keep its boat to decrease until 2020 40 to 45% of its tree gas.
China holds its boat to reduce the emission of gases from 40 to 45% until 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country on the COP16.
When the first public attack on the 16th world climate of the United Nations (COP16) assured Su Wei, his country would take great effort to shut down the carbon tracks and to transform its industry.
He concluded that in the last four years, his country has invested 245 million in order to reduce the gas emissions.
However, he explained that China would not change its objectives but would work together with the international Community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese area in matters of climate was divided into four aspects: dialogue, development of capacity, creation of institutions and support of pilot programmes.
In all aspects, it has been made progress, explaining the derogation of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives for the reduction of gas emissions.
On the other hand, he highlighted that in China the authorities of the Federal States were associated with those of the Central State and the Communities to achieve the objectives of energy protection, effective energy use and reduction of emissions.
▪ He concluded that some multiannual plans have already been attacked or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those receiving money from other countries.
For example, he took into account the programme for effective energy use, introduced in the last five years and received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the Government and from private hands.
There is also a project on provinces for climate changes, another to exchange traditional luminosity by energy parkings and another to weight and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, Scientific Government Advisor for Climate Changes in this country, assured that China's efforts would be greater than generally adopted.
He showed that the pro-capf emission of gas gases in China amounts six tonnes per person while there are 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine-procent total contribution to environmental pollution.
In the past five years, energy efficiency has been increased by twenty-five years, and it will be more to happen until 2020, he explained.
Legal Exclusion Espines: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former panist party president had the right to return to the National Order Commission and to request what the right was to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former president of the PAN had the right to return to the National Order Commission and to request what the right was to him.
In an interview that was found before the complaint of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as the Governor of the Federal State, he explained that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to return to the Commission de Orden del Council Nacional in the case of a decision from a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not to think at the time of 2012 and that a alliance to the presidential candidates had never been seated at the negotiation stage.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that national action strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December in which his followers were selected.
"This (A Allianz in 2012) is a subject that never was on the negotiation stage, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the assembly election he was and fulfilled his purpose," he performed.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back to the dialogue at 71 years, therefore "not fearing the internal competition; in contrast, "We enjoy them and strengthen us," he commented.
He said that the Council would certainly choose the or the best president that needs the national action for the next three years, and therefore he overlook the staff "to whom the Council would decide."
"I'm very uninquired and open there, I'd be proud to make one of the five over the office of the president."
He prognosed that the surprise of the party will reflect in the next elections, though "is not at the time to think of 2012."
"Now it's why the Governor Gabino Cué's response."
In this context, he highlighted that the three governments, which resulted from allians between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, were observed by the fahne . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón because of his debate course in the framework of his four-year government, Caesar Nava called the Prises to think about the six-year period of the former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the crack," he confirmed.
He believes that the inhaber of the Federal Government expresses such as those he can make in a talk in Auditorio National, because in this country there is no boundary or less a censure.
Obama is involved in Twitter for undocumentated students
"If you are for the destruction of the Dream Act - law, then call your Senators and insist on the violation of this law," said the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilization to support the Dream Act - law on legalization of undocumentated students with a message on personal blog in the social Twitter network.
"If you are for the destruction of the Dream Act - the law, then call your Senators and insist on the violation of this law," twittered Obama.
His short notification contains a Cyberlink to a larger document which requests the public to contact their Senators immediately, since the vote of the law is directly favoured.
"with the voice we expect is the time to listen to you," he states.
The message was broadcast after the 42 Republican Senators refused to block all votes for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from Bush’s days and the financing of the Government.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the spread of atomic weapons.
About the blocks of the Republicans of the Act of Dream Act and other projects, the President Robert Gibbs said, he trusted that, when the tax theme was solved, a time schedule for the other projects could be established.
"I think we've got a lot of time..."
"All of us agree that the fiscal matter must be developed before the end of the year..."
"I think we can take an agreement at any time, and then we can plan the end of the age," he said.
The president of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, said on Thursday, "he would vote on the conclusion of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative for the legitimization of undocumentated students from the next Thursday in the Senate, would be more likely in the next week.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the law of the American Traction would legalize about 800 000 young people who were immigrated into the United States when they were not yet six years old, while they had been held in this country in the last five years and were recorded in a proper educational institution or in the army.
However, the violants of the law need to distort the initiatives of 60 votes, therefore they are noted on the votes of a handful Republican, and at the time, the organizations of the proverbs of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the derogation of the law.
The democrats of which the majority of the dream Act are undertaken have over 58 places.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said, he would vote and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the Defensors of the Dream Act must receive several Republicans on their side, if other democrats should decide to take the initiative back.
The majority of the republicans belong to the exe, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Ha Capulet from Utah and Kay Bailey Hu©inson from Texas, but they explained that it would not be undertaken at another occasion.
Another republican who had spoken to the law, John McCain, has not yet established his attitude until now.
Although the representative house has another version, the analysers agree that the dream Act is in the senate before the greatest obstacles.
With literature put the finger into the wounds
The second part of 'The Lust in the Language' was a passport in which the participants strengthened for the story
"What about the sex in the language I understand, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second part of 'Los placeres de la language', a cycle who celebrated the Spanish literature and used in this occasion the subtitle of her question (in another event the table was given to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "build us in difficulties," the argentinian writer shocked the public, which was mostly composed of young people who were gathered at the International Bookmaster in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this modernized table by Marisol Shultz, in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she did by Gonzalo Celorio, and then recognized the Shultz as a great story. Luisa told in the first person and is the protagonist who is on the search to know what is a "wound" and from Ar日 to Ar, from which she does not receive any answer, but indications for the leaders of her confession.
The infectionologists leave her convince, "Patience is not my strength, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the dream atologists that cut down the spirit in the middle of the street, and who explains that the wound is not a scientific meaning, the psychoanalytic covers the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the narbe."
The main figure of the story makes it easier and closes that it "from the wound only found that it is really open and not existing." But she is convinced that the pleasure in the language and their falls are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramírez also presented an exciting story that he called 'Lob of the find' and where the finger in the wound is not discovered, but is discovered.
With advice to the magic realism, he told a famous dumb who touched the clouds, who returned a far traveling men or restored the lost tugend of a girl. The story made a wheel and reported by America, the Great Roman, who was missing from the beginning to his own cronists, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the overflux of stories spoken by the Jeroboam.
"Cervantes, who included us all (the writers), shocked the predicted witnesses who saw the stories that were shown as true, but in other ways the story of America would never be told - with educational power, which even became the shameful feeling."
However, he highlights, "when there are the foolish and liars who are the best to imagine things," and there are reality and lies close to one another, where you do not know anymore, where the story belongs to where the fixed literature reaches the bullet.
He actually calls that the Tradition Cervantes.
"On him we've been anxious to be what will be told."
When Mayra Montero was in the row, the writer commented and praised the case of the interpret, to which the invitation of the FIl to the chair "The Finger in the wound".
The Kubanerin and Puertoricanin have contributed to the great wounds of social violence that enjoy their country - as the result of the battles in the trade of the Latin America.
"I think that > literature, Poesia, Li ́ contains a silent, not pre-planed commitment," she explained, after she had highlighted that the literature is communication and commitment, which is building between the author and the readers as with a "chemic reaction".
The evening, the Spanish Dichter Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "the finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a quickly living world, the intellectual habits and the control of the knowledge of dogmatisms are also running out, and it will be forgotten, "that behind every activity is a small none and behind every decline a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thinking and reality, we need to advise: And Nuanciers often mean to put the finger into the wounds and becoming those who feel much better if they are in the form of charitations, in black and white, thinking of pre-produced ideas without nuance, and also to rebuild the potents that are supposed to share the world in black and white, he noted and invited them to discover a meaning of the writing.
Romano fights his first title
Ruben Omar Romano looks back to three delays in end games, he learned ups and abs in his car, but three times he played decision-making games.
In the Duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, there are two different styles, which are provided by their respective trainers, and the meeting known by the opposers reflects in the results.
Ruben Omar Romano looks back to three downloads in end games, he has learned ups and offs in his car, but three times he has made decision-making games, and until then he has kept well, why this opportunity is of very special importance for him.
The Argentinan played with the medaille to the second champion, he left a step behind the winners and surprisedly he had performed successful games with the same team.
The sanist strategy reached the first end game in the "Torneo Opentura 2002", when del Morelia had the moves in the hand, with which he experienced a great delay against Toluca with 4-2; later, in the "Clausura 2003" he reached the decided duell that he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Just with Santos Laguna on the 'Toneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Ruben had to repeat a repair, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choquéeros was unexpected after 210 minutes of games, but at the elf meter he went with 3-1 and got two possibilities to cut his title, but then three of his players were deceived the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two end games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, large rivals. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again from the disaster and free from the bad boy to be able first to celebrate a title, although he confirms that the most important game is for him.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, it's for a club, for my pleasure, which I'm giving, and therefore the title will come to me, but what before is the most important thing," commented the taxman when asked him about the lost end games.
The last end game is still strong in his memory, he assured that we have learned much of it: "The only teaching we can get out of it is that until the judge does not finish the end, we can not celebrate, we are ready at the line, for the last time we were prepared with two miles, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is finished, there is no opportunity to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by elfmeter shoots, it does not hurt him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to come at the elephmeter shooting, you want to end in the regular game, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but, despite, the shick Hall prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to the nervousness or the violent effort to keep the title already in the hands that left us something for this end game, and we hope that it will not come to this time."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer a second champion and first to cost the glory that brings the title with it.
The United States amends the rules for the receipt of a visa
The persons must be presented before their consultation at the Visual Services Institute; the costs will be reduced.
Since 10 January 2011, the procedures for application of a visibility in the United States message and in the consulars are changed.
In the new procedure, the majority of the applicants must be presented before their consultation at the Vis-Request Services (ASC, the beginning letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall take the biometric data of the applicant to be checked by the consultant before the consultation.
The new procedure has certain benefits for the aspirants, including:
It is not necessary to pay the termination, the processing of the Visa request and the transport service with which the document is distributed.
The applicant shall only give one single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the teenager to 140 faces for a tourist visa, 150 € for visa with request (a visa for timeworkers) and 390 -- for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa must not be advised in the consulat, they have to imagine only the ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data are obtained in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the consultation are less than before.
Those who bear the visibility in the consulars of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must not pay the service uptake of 26.

NASA announces the external life fund
The North America Room Travel Daying has invited a press conference to present a fund tomorrow which will have effect on the search for lives in all.
The National Air and Room Carrier (NASA) of the United States gives tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery that could be discussed by the theory of the existence of alien life.
The fund will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 p.m. at a press conference at NASA's sitting in Washington by experts of astrobiology. It is an economy that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the Presse Conference was concluded, the NASA assured that it would represent "a careful fund for the search for foreign life", which has solved speculately in experts of other countries.
The discovery could indicate that there could be human creatures in enemy environments that you had to be inhabitable until now. The hypothese was opened that they could transform themselves into intelligent life - as humans - if their live conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemit National Alk Park, California. It is in a environment that has been maintained too too too too too many forms of life, since the sea is strongly arsenal.
In any way, the microbie uses the arsen as a survival resource. In view of this capacity, the chances that there may be on other planets that do not have our sliping atmosphere could have similar life.
When these organs change the arsen, according to the astrobiologists, "is actually a different life, a second life form that distinguishes from us."
Tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference, the real government of their funds gives the roommates tomorrow.
At the conference, the Geobiologist Pamela Conrad shares the possibility of life on March, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the guardians, Titan (the greatest Mond Saturns) studys the question of whether his chemical composition is equal to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patron form a opposition block
With the reform of the Initial Network on the Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they shall be complained.
The 60th legislation period has already started, and a opposition block has already been installed by the lawyers of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, which represented himself as independent. The four questioned: the entry of the 'two-partial system' into the room.
Before the start of the introduction session in the 60th legislation period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and the Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the original network, since they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeat, it would have introduced a 'two parties' system, because now there would be two persons, the same number of parties that controlled the Congress.
These four lawyers, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who agreed against the president stated by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his property as a steward president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties with these reforms had institutionally introduced their political opinion.
He concluded that in the next days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and that they had been out of its political will, and if they had not, they would be subjected again by both parties to the end of the opposition coalition.
"When I come here (the coalition of opposition), this is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that there would therefore be a pluralist group.
It can't be permitted, he continued that the Congress, after he was monopolistic, now should be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that in the Congress a eternal two-party system should be governed."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five lawyers and speaks with other colleagues and colleagues to become more", explained the Convergencia-Mitglied.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT indicated that the Congress has currently been transformed into a "beut" for two.
"Before it was just a party, now they share these too two."
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the lawyers and to give them their place to the negotiations.
"The five, which are currently seen in different groups, have decided to join our place in the negotiation station because of the reform that has been conducted and implemented by the other, have not been agreed with this reform."
200 000 Peso more for "the supplier"
The city management of Mazatlán pays another shock to the constraint property of the company for electric material.
Another shock over more than 200 000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city manager.
This is the amount paid to the ownership of the company for electric material in the second half year, 1.20,000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the town management, this has been issued to a amount of 200.144,56 peso, with No. 9258447 on the past 16 November, with the use "After open accounts".
The teacher Luis Miguel López Moreno had already provided that more money from the community would go to this supplier. It is observed by the Superior del State's auditorium because it has increased prices.
What has not been acquired is the total amount that you are still debt and therefore the number of shocks that will be issued for the benefit of Camacho Palazueless.
"Nothing has been cooked with her, it is just paying the debts, just as the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last shocks "sucked" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October, and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as it is prescribed legally when an ASEA's company is in question to prevent other administrations from carrying out their services, the tax officer assured that their services would not be taken again.
After publishing the newspaper of Northwest on 25 July, the test of the shocks issued by the town administration to its suppliers, it was that before, from March 2008 to July 9 2010 during the three-year official period of the citizen Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the community had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 shacks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam where they entered shocks in the value of more than 3 million peso.
Tourist places must be improved
Tourists undertaken the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist in the entrance of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested to give special attention to the authorities, the areas that are in a bad state and to put a bad picture on the town.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the trade union of the Zona Dorada, noticed that it was required for various opportunities to achieve the traveling goal and to transform the bad conditions that the tourists face to new employment opportunities or rounds.
He said that the bad state of the streets and roads would have been negatively affected, since the tourists would go to the blind and see the injustice, until they would apply to the nearly placed ships.
"The people don't know what it means to close a company on a day, and they do not think about how much money are lost, for otherwise they would not do the building work in this way quietly and unplanned."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's street would have made attention to the violent prevention and remaining maintenance work from the city.
"The assembly must take its responsibility and avoid what happens again. How is it to do so? Now, by a preventive warning instead of to improve everything in the neighborhood," he explained.
"We expect to have a clean city, because not only because it is a foreign area, it must be kept, but also our inhabitants have a right to a clean living room. The town administration must change its ability to get the city in a good state."
"There are other places that also look inappropriate and inadequate," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"We need more than just publicity to lock tourists. It must be offered a product, a city that cleanses its streams and streets, and the tourist attractions continue in shoes," he added.
"There has not been given enough attention and this type of events only makes what is clear for all: a holding is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, secretary of Promotion Turistic, expressed how important it is to save the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be right enough and let a bad image appear.
He designed a number of places that should be brought together with the city to the foreigner. It should be priority to make the city clean, ordinary and attractive for the foreign transport.
"Goodly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural places that have to be cleaned and cleaned once in order to make them attractive to the foreign transport and to bring them to the inventar with which we draw for this trip.
IP requests the results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better sinaloa, which is before many challenges.
The business industry of Mazatlán calls for a worth Parliament to free from Ab­n to the parties and the Government, because Sinaloa has been disappointed and has great problems.
The 60th Parliament was shown yesterday. It is set out of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido New Alianza, two of the PRD, one of PT, one of the Convergence and one of the PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a clean work, feel committed to the society and to the various social groups, which are assigned to a responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and pateralism.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the Coordination Council of the CCE, proposed that the new Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better sinaloa, which is before many challenges.
"We hope that the ladies really exercise their right to act free of derogations between the parties, because it is usually that they take agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming themselves into the Karneval Compars of Governors and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to the building of the needed bridges to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they perform a trustworthy work and use themselves before all things for the society and their groups, because there were the inhabitants of Sinaloa, who had their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Hotel Board Tres Islas, says that one of the great challenges that the 40 people's representatives are opposed is the job and the common work for the economic growth of the State, since today the economies are extremely complicated.
"The most important is that they take economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote the creation of workplaces."
In view of the foreign transport industry, he requested the new ladies that they should grant the necessary local value in the public household in order to promote the Ministry of Foreign Traffic.
"I have understood that the Ministry is with the secondary resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity, which brings devises and investments into the country and is in direct competition for agriculture."
The tourist projects must be allocated to money, the State security must be undergone, and the alcohol legislation which has not been renewed in the previous legislation periods must be set up at the latest.
Searching for the Holy King
Puppens, cars, cars and other games want the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For parents, it will be difficult to comply with this desire on the next Thursday, because the household is not more and not less than 12 persons and a cattle box.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not give them the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the game and clothes that they are so blessing.
The family resides in a wise house in the seat of Salvador Allende. She lives from hand into mouth because the father has no fixed work.
"People hard times have been told because my husband has no job, but we surprised mandarins and cartoffles... on the afternoon I'm going with the gates to buy on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the kids.
The four-year Adelaida would like a puppet or a train road, while her three-year old sister Isabel wanted a barbie puppet.
The year old José Alfredo wants to have a "model car" since sometimes and for its eight months old brothers Jesus offers Cayetana clothing in the size of an anniversary.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster,' but I answered him, 'Let us wait, boy,' because it was very tired," Cayetana remembered triumph.
For the elderly children in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old Mary Guadalupe has the size 12; the eight-year-old Isaiah is the size 10, while the eight-year Miguel size is 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan felt tennis shoes. A couple of the size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to meet the dreams of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can share in the "Heiliger King will be searched" campaign by playing or paying in the receipt Hall of the newspaper Noroeste s.
14 mutilated dealers arrested
In the middle of the middle-week, a Cannabis production and sales network was carried out on the home investigations in the Esteria Administrative Region.
Four persons have been arrested and will be charged with different accusations.
The home searches were played in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in which places were to be served primarily for the manufacture.
"Independently 750 cannabispfeen, four kilo hashish, bars and exhausts that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speakers of the security police of Quebec.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, from which two of the men that are the main treasures of the rubber were taken from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons will have been held in Sherbrooke for hours after their arrest.
They may, inter alia, be accused of the production of cannabis, whose possession is for sale, completion and crime service.
These home investigations were found in the light of a long-term research activity that had been departed over a year.
"The information received from the public hand has enabled us to carry out these decisions," exactly Mr Ruel.
About the 70 policies of the regional investigation unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Service and the police officer Memfrämagog had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be persecuted unfortunately.
The draft legislation of conservators, which, as a result of the Government, is to regulate the problem of the ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be taken into account all precautions after the three opposition parties have given the middle-week that they cannot benefit the proposal.
"I'll be able to get up with pressure against this chart."
"I'm holding with a party who put your feet on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, Chief of Liberals, after the end of the weekly Caucus session before the members collected.
The Liberals claimed to maintain the legal draft which allows each person coming from one of the persons identified for the transport of illegal immigrants until a year, deteriorates as proposed by the Canadian legal and freedom constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, Chef of the Bloc Quebécois, also stated that the law project could not be understood because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are, however, and it seems that all opposition parties are contrary, so we will wait for what the government takes," said Mr Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has pointed to the criticians who requested that their party had not been adequate to the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrates agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we also try to implement another law project, of C-35," chow.
Therefore, we did not expect the draft law of the conservators because he looks for the guilty of the refugees and holds children captive for at least a year,” said Chow.
Imigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with which and ignore the wills of the Canadians.
"The Canadians are increasingly shared by the ladies that they do not tolerate this kind of home immigration, these crimes related to Canada and treat the country as a footsteps."
"You expect Canada to take hard measures," so Minister Kenneys.
"The Government has not announced any trustworthiness in relation to its draft law that could lead to the country to elections that the Government had rejected.
However, a conservative stated to the QMI Agency that the Government would call a vote so that every opposition ladies would immediately claim to his electors.
The new unit does not find any uniformity
Despite the announcement of the potential establishment of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collution, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New Yorker Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The Metropole has passed over a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the middle-week announcement has surprised more than one.
It must be said that this action has not been discussed in the latest, on 29 October, on the basis of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer Police Service, despite the presentation of Robert Dutils.
It was also unexpected that Stéphane Bergeron, Critiker and member of the Partie Quebécois, this announcement in point of public security as "out of the hut cleaned caninchen" and "in a tissue fixed solution" qualities.
Minister Dutil had turned back to those who cared that the political power had too much influence on the questionary, future unit.
"You'll see the result when we'll announce it," he began to confirm himself.
"Man is aware of this problem."
According to Rejean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can be replaced by the implementation of a public investigation.
"When more Mr. Charest insists to prevent the education of this research committee, more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the retreat of Jean Charest," explained Yves Boisvert, Do® for ethics and systems in the ENA (State. High-school for high-administrative training).
In order to get out of this gas, he proposes to the Quebec to introduce a special mandate for the financial checking in order to make such investigations related to corruption and secret discharges.
"You should be able to expand the mandate of test control," so entschied he.
He also believes that the Quebec of the test control could establish the same power as the Commissioners, which would also allow you to commit the people to say.
The education of an existing unit is not the only project in the shadow of the Government of Charest.
The Quebec is also requested by Ottawa to change the penalty law in order to be better set up on this type of crime.
This request is made by the Master State lawyer of Operation Marteau, who informed the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the legal prosecution in this type of criminal persecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, the State Minister for Public Security, was on his side, his colleagues by the Justice, Rob Nicholson, are currently involved with certain newspapers related to this folder.
During the 2001 Operation Printems, the groups of engine railway policies, 131 persons were arrested, although the penalty law was not renewed.
It is therefore that Ottawa has implemented the law against anxiety.
Flowers under strict monitoring
Several fluses remain on the basis of the high downwards that have been held in some regions of the province since Thursday continue to be strictly monitored.
In Shawinigan, in the Maurice Administrative Region, it came to a earthquake on midweek.
Two houses were pre-evacuated.
On the evening, there was another earthrutch in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, the Governing Region Lanaudiere.
A street has been joined together.
From Thursday to Middle East, strong rainfalls from 40 to 70 billion have been reduced to several regions.
between 20 and 40 billion further decreases were expected here in accordance with the regions until Thursday.
The areas northern the floor and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
This is the total of up to 100 millimetres of rain viewers.
Since the snow meal has already been gathered in certain parts, the overcome of several water flows is protected.
At midnight, the Quebecer Security Service warning on the highwater alarm on the Ureau and Achigan flows in the Lanaudiere region was called.
The flussleeps in the north, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentin mountains and Chéne in Lotbinière are here to be the object of the highwater monitoring and continue to be watched.
In the Lanaudière region, the harmful neighborhoods have followed the transition of some sea in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a broadcast was prolonged due to strong rainfalls.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain sea has caused the slidering of several roads, especially in the community of Mansfield and Pontefract.
The security service remains in alarm preparation and monitors the situation most precisely, such as Annik Bouchard.
The Quebecer Landeshochwasser area issued in the middle of its middle-week warning of the strong growth of several flows, especially by machineongé, assomption, Oureau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont adjusted to part
The Quebecer moderator Stéphane Dupont, before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Standards (CCNR), has made a part of his controversial statements on social protection and haitianians, as well as because of his accidental talks about radio.
The CCNR agrees with the opinion, Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinion, but certain expressions had, however, "no information about the social protection and unrequired negative representations of Haitianers, as well as such an unfair reason that is not appropriate to the exposed sentences."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a debate on suicide, which includes the spread of the names of two persons who have committed suicide, would violate the code of transmission.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 issued sentences.
The first available was introduced by a claim of the "Front Common of Persons assisted socials du Quebec".
The activist organisation claimed that the amounts mentioned in the sentence were unnewful.
Moreover, the modernators should be solid as irrelevant outcomes.
As regards the subject of self-mortality, Moderator Stéphane Dupont represented the opinion that the self-mord was a expression of fiction.
The majority of the supervisory Council members had concluded that the sentence was that self-mord could not be considered as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Council takes into account that the implications of the "Dupont le midi" sentence would have involved a familiar and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not charged with any tape against his person.
The last fighting point was regarding the statements that had been discussed in Haiti's landscape.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort have now provided a medium-effective fighting conversation that has made a lot of reactions.
The CHOI Moderator had explained not to have been acquired for Haiti's help because it was not safe to know whether the needs would really receive the money.
The Watch Council believes that these comments have not been misuseful characters, but their cumulative effect represents an unsuccessful negative representation of haitians.
"I have already cut off my three-day suspension penalty in this thing."
"My act has been juvenile for a half years," said the Moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board claims the spread of an uncontinued expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted "without his obligations".
The consequences for the sender who, among other things, had to communicate his decisions only during the main sentence period within a period of three days are low.
A king of the Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacedine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian Urgency, has made a very special course.
The atlet that is held in "Sanda" (Full Contact Kung-Fu), in Kickboxen and Thaiboxen, now grows in search for new challenges to the tatami and to the boxing of the world.
"I have started in Algeria 12 years ago with battle sports like Kung-Fu and Kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been in the Metropol since 2008 to continue developing among the professions.
I personally seek the battle of allerories, because for those who are not able to present him the mixed battle arts, fighting in North America are rare."
Recently, the worker of his character as a security officer, as well as the UPS firm, gave his rivals bad news, in which he recognised between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland, the worldmaster of the Amateurs two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Propertyation (WKA).
"I've won the winning in the category of the full-contact Kickboxen and Thaiboxen," he explained.
"When I'm preparing for the world pocal in San Shou in China."
"The fighters were invited from every category who had placed themselves in the last world mastership among the first four."
"I got babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"2005 I've been after Vietnam."
"2007 I ended the tournament in China on the fifth place while I became the third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is important that I have made progress in every fight."
"In this Rhythmus I will be first this time or in the next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are springing from China, where foots and footscapes are allowed as the grounds.
The two conflicts usually play on a platform, rarely in a boxing.
The most renommate box fighter, which has come out of this kind of battleport, is the American vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is probably in the world of war arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event in his car, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bo ́ of the Kung-Fu.
"This legal battle is the highest and most seen in China," explained the sympathic pound chariot.
"It's a little like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium Thailand)."
"It was a super-experience."
Sometimes in the half final of his category (80kg) he had won his first battle before he lost in the final.
"The one who tried me was a real Profi," he analyzed.
"There are four mixtures per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the half finals take each other at the end of their category."
"These the winners of every category offer the bridge to cross one champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without exemption
Hydro-Quebec has approved project planning for 450 million in mutual agreement contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle project.
In the middle of this lavine, more than 100 contracts are a consortium, consisting of BPR, Dessau, SM group and Axor, which has received the most important part, namely the project leader, of a sum of 295 million.
This consortium, named "Energy gerance", was designed as a result of the decision of Hydro-Quebec, to the sector its responsibility, to transfer this important, hydroelectrical project at a sum of 5 billion.
In early 2005, the Consortium "Energy Gerance" endorsed the lucrative contract without having given a public statement.
For the Parties Quebecois, the return to business consorties is a serious ethical problem that causes the risk of competition pollution and a price increase.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and strengthening competition."
"This means that you're going to carry carded games in place in a secret way and now openly," said Silvain Simard, a lawyer of the PQ, on the press conference last night.
Simard had opened the question before the National Assembly on the early morning, because it seems hard to understand how the interest of the public can be used in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted on the afternoon, considering that it would have been negotiated with this Treaty as a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she warned by strengthening that PQ was "inadvertent" and "leave it to her feet."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ would be excused.
The model of the consortium is a worldwide practice.
It is usually a time-term covenant that allows two or more companies to establish their experts in relation to a command to a claim for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project shows a high level of complexity in relation to its work measure.
The building procedure is in the past and will be established until 2012.
However, the Treaty was forgiven without having been able to find a competitive fight; it had already been negotiated.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself does not constitute any exception for relatively simple projects.
As observed in Le Devoir last week, the model applied in the area of building and consultation of the consortium is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflow of the Quebecer Company Governor allows the name of more than 200 consorties from which some seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of its nuclear competitors, with which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult.
Each link, and there are several decades, leads to one and the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
As regards the "Energy Gerance" consortium, Minister Normandeau stated that "the territory of Baie James has been subjected to a special workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Quebec has taken into account this area in particular since the 70s".
Real Laporte, the large employer of the Société d'energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued an enclosure that has allowed the nose to run over the area to allow the project management contract.
"If you make a statement and there are only few applicants, your prices will be faster."
"You have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this March and say to you: a satisfactory agreement will be made to a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is not determining, but the understanding of persons," confirmed Laport.
This contract authorised by the Consortium "Energy Gerance" is part of a long list of contracts received by the Partie Quebecois.
The contracts were authorised by the Hydro Quebec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle project.
After a review, the Le Devoir numbered more than 100 engineers and advisers contracts, companies or their holdings, including resource labs, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had made 22 contracts, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without calculating their share in "Energy Gerance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They are totally at $449 783 344, including the "Energy Gerance" contract over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had allowed the four companies that constitute the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of "Parti libéral du Quebec" to be.
Minister Normandeau had made claims that the PQ was equally related to the companies they were "financed" before she claimed that it was more important about their leading forces.
Barometer conscious consumption - The "green" label is not confidential
Green, but unfair skeptic.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also less to the known marks or eco characteristics that are to control his choice.
Damage, although it is in a medium-effective universe, where information for a conscious consumption is just so mixed: the barometer conscious of responsibilities has a lack of credible information, an insufficiency that makes it known as a bremse of his commitment, as the first reading showed that it was retained tomorrow.
Although they have provided the consumption of so-called social products in 2010, the Quebecs seem to have a little credit to pay them.
Two thirds of the Quebecer population are indicated, in fact, to give the environmental engagement of companies a little faith like the Green Company Requirement, so that it provides a mechanical instrument for the responsible consumer of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another foundation: the help of consumers doubts the confidence of the official certificates which are used to the most fair products, but also the credibility of the products and marks that are aware of the environment, as the barometer.
According to the same pattern, only 14,6% of the Quebec population will be taken seriously.
The information regarding responsible consumption seems to be important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently in close to one third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, empty and doubtful characters of the information were embarrassed by 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the price of the products.
▪ A third of the Quebecs of the specific performance of the green products and services that you are trying to put on them is mysteriously.
According to another communication, the aid of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the marking of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also prefered to 61% purchases of their town quarter and benefited from the purchasing of food built in their region.
Greener and responsibilities - the environmental consumption index has reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 in this year - the Homo consumption of Quebec lie – is to present himself as King of the Recycling, who is trying to reduce its tracks left in the environment by careing for the protection of animals.
However, the social and environmental science seems to be preserved by car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecs have indicated that they have been able to have adequate use in 2010 or preferred to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The traveling and carrying was also provided by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behaviour of behavior, which provides the clean views.
State facilities for the receipt of eXcentris
The Quebecer Government, which was invited by the Society and the company to share financially in the receipt of the eXcentris eXcentris, agreed with a cooperation, but only in a form of competitive facilities.
The developer society and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a spending of seven million, from the Ministry of Cultural Ministry for the receipt of Daniel Langlois Chinese complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to submit it again to its Chinese function, did not obviously receive what they requested.
Although the government has accepted to involve it in this matter, however, in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected spending, the Quebecer Government offers a contribution to less than the initially expected height that could call an existing solution to beneficial conditions in life, at least according to the sources acceptable from the state of circulation.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec, which has been redirected totally from the bottom to below.
A proposal with a action plan was already sent by the President of the Société de Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, leading the act eXcentris.
A few days ago, he had given her a last issue report.
However, the proposal of the Cabinet was submitted to SODEC at the middle-week.
Parallels and ­uses have the time to answer them until 31 December.
Anyway, it seems that the Priorities of the State spending are actually thrown to the side.
We recall that Quebecer has rejected a direct state investment to support the receipt of eXcentris by providing the argument that the Ministry of Culture has no financial assistance for immobilious projects that he has not allowed other Chinese sales.
However, several other market shareholders in the segment complained to substantial, economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois, after its own financed construction of the Kinos for years, had presented the authorian kino in the spaces of his Chinese complex, which could justifie the exception from the State case.
The lack of Chinese sales showing independent films is more evident in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the stage.
The Society and the company Parallele with Christian Yaccarini at the top, control a private financed campaign from which they hope a sum of $700,000 to cover the acquisition.
Since the early 2009, only one leanway continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future purchasers is to open the three Chinese sales on 27 February next year with the introduction of the very learned film of Xavier Beauvois "The Men and the dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not revoke the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignored what he and his group maintained from the following corrected proposals that have been made to them.
Heavy secret of complexed Canadian
The new, `ananian diplomatic guides broadcast by WikiLeaks claimed the secret of what the United Nations find under the minority complex of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same shape they open the overleading feeling against Canada.
Consequently, the Canadian diplomates were surprised that the Canadian electors did not have the Canadian American relations, and they believe that the President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government to carry out their budget of 2009!
The four new communications between the Ottawa message and Washington, which have been publicly broadcast last night, offer more picant details than the only substantial content that you have to be stuck on.
One of the data connections of 22 September 2008, such as during the period in which the federal election campaign was fully available, reports on which point the United States NÃ no longer shared in the units discussed by their political heads.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the newspaper in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins provides various clarification options for this situation.
"A Canadian nearly resident minority complex may be allowed to speak about the Canadian, political leadership much better than to move the United States to the black Peter at this choice (e.g. in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United States, as he concluded, are therefore "the speaking goliath of this choice: all representative, but too dangerous to talk about him."
The newspaper understands these "hearing silences" at least, since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "is the ability of a candidate, a party and much more than one party officer to lead such a key relationship that the elector has in mind when he walked as a key factor."
The second expression of this feeling of importance is read in the report sent by Terry Breese on 22 January 2009 in Ottawa, which President Barack Obama should prepare for its first wedding in Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continued existence of the Government in the confidence vote on the Federal House on the beginning of February, in which Canada will give its first debt after more than one year, which has occurred on the basis of a relief programme of 30 to 40 billion," describes Breese.
Nothing he knew that the Government had to take the Parliament's meeting before Wednesday to prevent the coalition of the Parliament and would affect the continuous existing of the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed relief programme.
Another, dating from January 2008 and by the advocate Wilkins, has made Washington a more negative picture that the broadcasts through CBC spread dramatic series from the United States.
The messenger is disappointed by sendings such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where we can watch a few subtil invitations to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the transfers for the purposes of the muscle protches of the accommodation.
Another report reports explicitly how Hillary Clinten has asked some prisoners from Guantanamo at their first bilateral meetings at their French colleagues Bernard Kouchner.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, however, on the basis of a individual decision on the case.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he made the State secretary a paper in Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The State Secretary has refused to review the act again."
Let us still note that the guards are in the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an elder and Stephen Harper, a very strong adviser, explained about CBC that the responsibles should be killed for this massive Leck.
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
World Plan for the Renewment of Lighting
The UN proposed a plan in Cancun to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in tree gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly a third of the associated reduction that must be achieved to stabilize the earthly climate until 2020.
This ambitionated plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large projects that hope to implement the UN in Cancun in order to carry out the disability of forced reduction obligations of industrial countries.
According to the yesterday schedule, the main problem in the form of 1,8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKWs delivered on earth would be avoided if the white-lighting birds, which are still representing a monopole of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescing or better by lightdiodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the gases of the worldwide furniture park.
In Copenhagen, the large issuers such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, have been committed to voluntary reduction plans that should underline the global FCKW emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt should be removed from this biology to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent this control.
In the white-lighting birds, 95% of energy grows in the form of warmness, and the rest of 5% produces the light.
With the complicated lighting sources, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED glucose, this energy need is re-reduced by twice.
The compact lighting sources hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED depths, for example those who have made Philip's manufacturer this week on the market - this company has also shared in the United Nations study - have a expectation of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a whitelighting bird, which provides an increase in the possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that it's a completely newly newly dealing with warmth only very little, they can also work with a regular opposition.
And they contain no cocktails.
Several specialists have shown that complicated lighting sources have shown reservations because they contain cocktails and that it is therefore necessary to exclude them as special, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the products provide a place of adoption.
However, the main source of cocktail emissions on the planet does not refer to the complication sources, but also to the coal powers that are essentially more cocktails to produce electricity used by the white-breaking birds.
Only in the United States, these coal plants exhausted 25,000 tonnes of cocktail each year.
The report details the wins that each country would be acquired by this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would cover a billion every year in the arrival of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 carbon powers which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Elf bones expected to recall the results of the election
UN General Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the "independent" publication of the results of the eleven-country election elections immediately after their time-life.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent election committee to receive their work and to provide the provisional results without further suspension," stressed a press speaker of the UN Chairman.
"He requests all parties and institutions of the eleven coasts to prove their responsibility and to include each initiative until the provisional results are published."
Despite the pressure carried out by certain foreign governments, the election Commission had allowed the deadline fixed at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
Circa 40 minutes ago, the Chairman of the CEI had informed in television that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
In the middle of the week, many calls from the world have been sounded, but the CEI can finally call the name of the winner of the second election round under the Leurent Gbagbo and its opposers Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo storage calculates the cancellation of "country" voting taxes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebellion stock of the Forces new (FN) during the failure in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, leader of the presidential campaign of the Eleven Coasts, had confirmed that the United Nations's practical manövers to protect the electors in the north of the country had threatened the president's attachments to the election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the claims imposed by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contractors are now more thinking that the highest court officer of the country is not neutral, since Paul Yao N'Dré is led by a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North, who distracts any connection with the ex-rebells, has evaluated the delay when the election results are "inaccessible" and requested Gbagbo to respect them, even though he has not gone so far to request the vengeance.
His constitutional parties confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and to introduce a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election Commission has prevented the results of public, illegal.
The second election of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crossing of the country's association and reconciliation process, which was split into two parts over years.
In the middle of the middle-week, the United States had warned the elf coasts that they could be kept responsible in the case of any claims for these.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against the 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who took the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first place) as an emergency candidate.
The rate of unemployment in France remains stable in the quarter
The unemployment rates in France in the meaning of the International Working Office (IAA) in the Metropole are strictly 9.3% (including the overseas departments to 9.7%) show the provisional, seizure information published on Thursday by the Statistical Federal Journal of the East.
The labourless number in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The details of the second quarter are 9.3% of the acquisitive population in the Metropole and 9.7% in the oversee departments.
In the year, the unemployment rates increased 0.1 percent points.
Income were considered 3,4 million employees of the French metropolis in the quarter, but they wanted to find a work, including whether they were applied every two weeks or whether they were working or not.
The situation of young people on the work has increased 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percent points within three months, +0.5 percent points over the year) and 25% in the areas of overseas continued to be weak.
In the quarter, 637.000 of the youths between 15 and 24 years were unemployed by IAA.
The elderly have, on the other hand, made an easily increase in the rate of worklessness of 6,4% in the Metropole (+0,2 prospectpoints over three months and over the year), e.g. 482 000 of the over 50-year-old persons, 6,6%, including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 years were able to benefit from the stability of labour unemployment in the quarter; 8.3% in the metropole (-0.1 percent over three months, +0.1 percent over one year) and 8.8% in France in total.
Following a conclusion of its procedures, the Statistical Federal Amministration Insee has not published the monthly discharges since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the statistical official of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Sunday a quota of 9,8% in France for October (included overseers) to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
In contrast to Alexandre Guérini, 53, leader of a consequence and brother of the President of the General Council of the Region Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and was delivered in the course of an investigation procedure on the public and under the debt markets in prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of submission of social powers, devotion of general dignity, herory, meditation in corruption, unlawful acquisition and weapons property, so his advocate.
"Alexandre Guérini is prepared for combating and intended to explain to all the issues that will make him the State Advocate instead of spreading the brain penns."
"It is easy to submit to him a number of punishable points, another thing is to prove this," said his legal advocate Florence Rault of the AFP (Agency France Presse) before hearing his man.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) in the Department, had valuated to allow the judge to make a memory to his justice before his audience through his advocate.
A member of the Guerinian, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and arrested at the middle of the night.
According to the law lawyer Lucien Simon had never done anything else than his depone he had to lead.
With regard to the business competence area or the destination of the fund, he would never have had known, as Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of Ballingsra Aubagne, was also accused of submission and compliance in the middle of the middle-week for submitting and compliance, but then, in the case of the protagonists of these acts, was replaced on free foot.
"My man was able to give statements to the facts that were before him."
"The leader State lawyer has taken into account not to exhaust him of his freedom," said his legal lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were accused and were released from the prison in the midweek night of Thursday, including two of them under legal supervision, such as the representative of the officer Michael Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, representative of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecutively followed due to "unapprovaled influence and employment".
Two State officers of the Balling Room Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Attracting and Reserving of General Gut by an officer of the public service", the other because of "Administration of public money".
In addition, Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of the "healing and submission of society powers".
The persons who were opposed to Guérini belonged to Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested on the basis of a similar case of abusing powers from public hand that had been affected by Corsica.
The fascinators deceive his company to have a pleasure to wash money from "heavy" crime circles.
The survey against X on the deterioration of public tasks, in particular in the relief area, will be conducted in April 2009, according to anonymous writings in the acts of several open investigations.
From close sources of investigation, the investigation is particularly concerned about the conditions of admission and the operation of a depone in La Ciotat, which also refers to residues from the area of Aubagne, as well as from certain cities of the town income region Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palast overcome its middle function for Property
For more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the Clotilde Reiss shick room, a young French researcher, held in Iran because of "spionage", the French public in the spirit, replaced the diplomacy in alarm preparation and accompanied the disruption of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all among the noticed diplomates of the United States.
The documents received by WikiLeaks and from the newspaper "Le Monde" provide some of the bases of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained to the Americans his responsibility to give these advice to their own crisis of "facilities" in Iran (a small group of wagers).
They show how the French responsibles have attempted to convince Washington that the release of young French does not have the release of the Kakavand cacavand, a prisoned in France, and a managed justice due to trade with material for the Iran nuclear programme.
It sets the way the French president tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making the idea believed that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde Roads in a large light.
In fact, he did nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegraph edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 has the title "Iran: French comments on the way of coming with prisoners".
François Richier, Elysée brothers in question, was discussed in the direction of Patrice Paoli, director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Mediterranean East with the Diplomatic Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained her the French method.
They invite Americans to put everything in order to restore their own citizens who would be held violently in Iran.
"Peace bearm," they said, "articulated sound and clearly and without submission" the words "based human rights", "unschuldig", "successful release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into a deceit that looks very sensitive to his image.
"Worship this more, while Irans ask you not to do it."
Because "Stillsweigen l" is nothing" through the discussion trials on inevitable ways, the Irans are "Masters in Education Manufacturers".
Mr Richier f' adds that the establishment of foreigners is a "periodic, iranian tactic": "abolition for political pressure".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reis from prison (which should be able to come on 16 August, on the day she flees into the French message) "requests payment of a large amount of money to the Irans" (230,000 euros).
And he allows the Elysée anti-equipment anti-equipment, a phenomenon that "will be enhanced".
The Irans could "in near future arrest one of the nearly 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison twelve days ago, but continues to be held in Iran.
An information was carried out: the Iraner’s Kakavand, whose delivery to the United States on the basis of illegal trade with a receiving electronic material to Iran, has been released from the prison after a judge in Paris.
The message of the Ananias is as many other observers, questions about this disturbing incident.
For Washington, who follows the illegal iranian networks of the acquisition of the nuclear programme, the release of Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a kitchen market?
The freedom of the Iranian against the French?
In the case of a renewed subdivision with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richter assured that this is not the case.
The Elysée, so he says, was not only "v fully surprised by the judge's decision," but also attempted to reject it.
"It has made a rain exchange between the French Presidency and the French Justice Minister" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Kakavand continues under the "strenger" view of the French secret service.
The Elysée broadcast chooses a phone number, repeats, informs the `anan'an diplomatic, the Iraner, "becoming now in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris".
With the care of Clotilde Reis in Iran, the Elysée does not have its efforts to believe through confidentialities and the media organized "flight trials", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent middle" role.
The Americans do not watch this A > without ironie and notice that the manipulation brings fruit, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of the 25 August 2009 dating telegrams is called "the media bridge of the French authorities".
What is based on so many "the witness" against Mr Assad, the Paris message is asked.
"Pleasing their declarations of lobprise gives the French authorities secretly that they have only a good idea of what they have actually done."
The document is so concerned with the reasons that the Elysée has led to defeat this figure.
The intense communications efforts "determine to act in the opening of Sarkozys", he analyzes.
A 2008 launched, which was then "reserved by many critical votes in France and in the foreign country as a frozen and unworthy."
"The Syrian role building" tries Paris to "leave Syria in front of the eyes, which beauty can be achieved by playing a active role in the region."
The goal is also to "seat divergence between the Iran and the Iran".
The news of the Ananias knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richter trusted her: "We don't know whether the people have done anything."
"But we thanked us, despite all things."
"This should be at least confused with the Irans."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elysée.
In a communication, he thanks to the President of Brazil, the Senegal and its "active role for the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans to middle-western
The South Korean Government will adopt a law named "the aske bread", which will be prohibited to the young people to play at the Middle-Western Online Games by locking their access to such government responsibilities.
A legislative draft which will invite the online players to refuse youths under 16 years after Middle-Western access to these games will be submitted to the Parliament in December, sharing representatives of cultural and family ministers.
"Most children play these games all night and then have difficulties with learning in school and also leading a normal life to day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin said, with this legislative draft, refer to Ministerial Deputy of the French Presse Agency France Presse.
The online games will be accessible again from 6 hours tomorrow.
The producer companies had a long time to prepare for the application of the law for a year.
The Government also makes it possible to ask the manufacturers to subscribe the time limit every day for access to these games to the youths whose parents ask for them to add the responsible.
He will also provide free programs to allow those who want to limit the time passed on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "netted" countries, and the newspapers report regularly of various, intensive use of Internet events.
The country is also an inappropriate champion in worldwide online-communications.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 more N′.
World Mastership 2018-2022: the FIFA calls the Governor country
In addition, on the basis of corruption demand, the Executive Committee of the FIFA on Thursday calls the Governors of the World Masterships 2018 and 2022, a highest political choice, in which the railways and the lobbying are attracting the technical criteria in the background.
One thing, however, is safe: the exhibition of the FIFA of 2018 is located in Europe, their traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands).
The issue 2022 will then be a little exotic; the International Football Bound hopes that after the Premier in the African continent in 2010, new territory (Katar, Âen) can continue to win for themselves, or its delay in the United States or Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Katar, the Belgian and the Netherlands Government Chef, Zidane, Beckham, →yff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a worldwide mastership.
So the powers behind the cows dropped to keep up until the last minute.
In other cases, it is difficult to create a hierarchie of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and the 2022) acts provide better arguments than their competitors.
But these instructions will not be so weighted for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which, with the implementation of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Themerie and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the enthries, could also destroy the opportunities for their own country, the way of the football, which only a single time had taken away the World Mastership, namely 1966.
The BBC had renewed the neighbourhood on Monday, extending a documentary report, which decided by three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
It's enough reason to hurt the FIFA and bring the English responsibles into a divorce, which firstly conducted a intensive lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Governing Boss hopes for a new upload of the shock acquired by former Tony Blair, which had achieved the Olympical Games organized in 2005 for London in 2012.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to revalue the picture of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because Duo Spain Portuguese does not fail to trappe with his already done stadium, his expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympical Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow pages of the two countries may be able to deteriorate their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English, as well as the doubts about Spain and Portugal's solvency, allows Russian chances, which have increased to weighty external sides, despite its layouts in the folder (towns, hotels, transports).
The Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided, however, that the unfair intervention to the attentions of the English press "unfair competition in the preparation of voting" from the members of the Committee.
"You're doing it with a fuck, you're trying to compromise it," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seem to be the logical favorites.
The first economic power of the world, the seat of the FIFA mains, the country seems to show a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea, which have set a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be dismissed for two countries that have joined the legal fight in 2002.
Another threat: the blessed authorisation of WM 2026 for China, which allows the Asian chances to fall on 2022.
The FIFA follows its extension towards new areas, but these two countries make a greater risk because of science.
Similarly, Japan and South Korea could suffer under the weakness of television rights accepted by the countries (from the time trial), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
The Gaulle was really drunk.
The middle border had believed that he was short.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the lowest wheat.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than these.
A mandate in Elysée calls the next one.
The current head of the state will therefore be the candidate in 2012.
But the openness is the side of the mystery, which is arrested by the presidential function, not well in view.
So you have to do as if the doubt exists.
In one, and in another sense.
2006, the attachers of Jacques Chiracs suggested that a mandate is not excluded without themselves to believe it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tongue to make his decision "at any time in the inheritance of 2011".
The fact that he would allow the "two mandates" perspectives in Elysée before the UMP parliamentaries, then had extended a little fiberability.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Wait.
The Chairman only noted that the 2008 constitutional amendment was the number of five-year Office periods of only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It's not the first time that he's recognizing the presidential election of such meetings in a humorous tongue.
"You're still worse than seven and half years with me, or best," he explained them in July 2009.
A new in May 2010: "Do not believe I don't think of the phase after."
His words from the previous morning do not make him to the candidate anymore than on the last day; but not less.
If they should make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the run around the candidate with the PS on a side.
But it is not the record of the competition with Segolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy has to make manifest.
In contrast, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which encourages many members of the PS more early than accepted to fighting.
The bad questions on the other side.
For the first time, the rights electors would provide a candidate from François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about," the Prime Minister responded directly and carefully.
"If he had a download as possible, he wouldn't be candidate," Jean-Pierre shared Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," Alain Juppé corrects, who has found himself with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain their purchase of State papers
The last assembly of the ECB's central bankkrate in the past year should provide opportunities to show how the crisis comes out, or at least announce a large number of unconventional measures of money policy to end the year.
The crisis of the State debt is committed to the Central Bank in Frankfurt, of course, cannot be allowed, even to affect the present, more than the stressed situation on the aircraft in order to prevent their deterioration.
Political costs would be too high.
The French Ministry of Finance Christine Lagarde has welcomed a press conference last night to the ECB's active role for the solution to the state-holding debt of Europe.
She has not expected to say if she thinks that the Central Bank can do more, for example, by encouraging her programme for the purchase of State assets.
"I will keep my advice for my trade partners...."
Jean-Claude Trichet, the President of the ECB, had shown it not very much about its presence in Brussels on the last day by the Economic and Election Committee of the European Parliament, but also to show that the programme of purchase of State papers on the secondary and that we will be "seen how the decisions occur in the congregation on Thursday".
Single science: The ECB will not change its leadership at 1%, the historical lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the BCE's obligation sales were doubled last week to approximately 1,35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of some traders, they have made new buyes last night on Irish and Portuguese State papers.
Generally, the Eurosystem central banks have made buying 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Under the vendors, the anti-equipment of a purchase course is not doubted (see page 29).
The people are not expecting any significant change.
If the investment businesses have already been dismissed from the ECB's arsenal for over three months, the latest will be made to the unlimited money reserves in freedom, even within a period of a week to three months.
The people are already concerned today that this action will be extended in a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a significant way."
"In other cases, she would have the risk of providing new spending in short view," says Michael Schubert, the people of the trade bank.
"A progressive progressive exhibition me seems likely more likely for the history of the first quarter of 2011," anticipates Norbert Brams, peopleswirt in Sal.
Uppenheim.
In the field of their interventions on the State debt market, the ECB "retained such a purchasing volume in Oblig's markets" (Fr. Norbert Brams).
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of the banks on the state debt markets in the Eurozone, the Central Bank has no choice other than to maintain their presence on the market.
"They must come on the market at every price to the staff of the deficiencies of investors and act in order to prevent the prejudice of the refunds paid to the Swive States," said a major obliginhaver last night.
Because if the rates are applied to the height flight, the States would be still more prevented from reducing their debt or stabilising their debt.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Government of Berlusconi goes to Italy in Deckung
After a weekly starting for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed with the decrease of the equations to 10 years.
A back to the thirsty silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Ministry of Economics, the Presidents of the region Tremonti have qualified the situation as "unnumberable" and have heard him with an "unpredictable" weekend, but they have soon dementated.
On Saturday, the rate with the German rates would have reached its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts on the covering of the competition risk would have increased at 263 points, which had indicated a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi indicated at the Ministerial Council that Spain's discrepance is at 400 basic points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "hearly concerned" by the "market turbulences" and a possible airport from Ireland.
"The message is that Italy, the population economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, Popswert at Hudson Institutes.
In the meaning of this, his problem is the absent of economic growth and the incoming, rapid, tax income that brings the State into covering its financing needs.
The last brossel prognoses were a cold dust for the government.
In future, a Italian growth of 1,1% in 2011 and 1,4% in 2012 will be expected... although the preliminary budget is estimated by 1,3% at the senate for the exam.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget debt will be more than 4,3% of the PIB in the next year (only 3,9%) and 3,5% in 2012 (see 2.7%).
Therefore, the resort to a new budgetary collective, which could be applied to a sum of 7 billion euros after the feasts.
"If necessary, new sphere measures must be taken," says economic investigator O日 Rehn.
Italy will receive the support of international institutions at an hour.
"The basic festivals of the Italian economy are fine and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeated since a long time," Arrigo Sadun assured the Italian wheat of the International Value Fund, which has been applied in IWF with Italy.
"In the present there are no problems, no short-term or long-term views, since Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of the PIB in 2011, A. R.), requires less stability progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD leader.
Remember the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face an incredibly request from the Deputy Chamber, which would have already been organized by the previous elections end of March.
It is therefore a little pleasant period for a decision on a serious crisis before.
Europeans think about the development of anticrisis measures:
Christine Lagarde had expressly highlighted it last night in a press conference in Paris: "I think it was still shown on Sunday Monday, as well as at evening: the Europeans are clearly together, ready and engaged in defending their elections and their election area."
Although perfectly relative - the decline to the rates of the State obligations last night was water on the mixture of governments and the ECB.
However, from the beginning of normalization it may not be the talk yet.
The Rating Agency Standard & Poor's had announced that they could replace Portugal's debt, which is the most effective destination of the speculators today.
"When there is a real lack of clarity and political property in May, which is particularly on banking systems," the opinion of the peoples of the Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, in particular, "the political time goes much lateer than the markets".
The countries that are conscious of both this bullet and the rubber that are involved in it intensify the debates to strengthen existing anticrisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly involved financial ministers and further with their opposers of the G20 are well-forwarded.
And this is also regarding the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan, the loss of unconventional measures to reinforce the euro zone countries in the field of markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started its Asia Tour on Sunday in Singapore to inform investors in Fernost about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his owner is not a explicit funding, he will certainly prepare it for this.
The first expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is intended for the next month.
A official representative of the Agency Reʹs has trusted that the United States supported a potential increase in the fund mobilised by the social, direct engagement of the IWF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first range, are sent to take structural reforms, especially in the field of the organization of work.
Reforms to be reached to the sphere measures, however, should show effects in the nearest future.
Lisboa and Madrid have defined another way than Greece and Ireland.
As the one and the other is to avoid any price, it is necessary to offer international assistance before they have set up their own budget correctives and have decided on inappropriate structural reforms that continue to put their confidence back.
The capital providers continue to discuss the options available to facilitate the normalization process of State awards markets.
Axel Weber, who was on the travel in Paris on 24 November, had first shown that if the 750 euros were not enough to be mobilised by Europe and the International Value Fund, the Union would not take back into its own bag.
The peoples of Barclays Capital, regarding the market of the State debt of the current actor, judge the prolongation of approximately 100 billion euros, "forward" in the form of a direct liquidity price.
This fund exists: the mechanism of donated financial stability, currently 60 billion euros.
A advice that has all opportunities to be studied carefully in the main towns.
In particular, when the market conditions are adjusted.
Snow and glass: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes still take up disorders, especially in the secondary networks of the Bretagne, and try to affect various economies.
Forty-four departments are now located in the alarm level of oranges due to the suspicious risk of snow and glass.
The regions of You, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have already reached 20 departments in the alarm level of Orange; 18 departments from mid-week and two, Dordogne and Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Meteo France, the intensive snowlighters touch the north of the Gironde and the charentes, it sneaks easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snows are expected from 2 to 5 cm, mostly from 7 to 10 cm, as well as from 1 to 3 cm, even to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The areas of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are involved.
The cases of snow are carefully enough to deal with deficiencies and to affect certain economic sales, says Meteo France.
In the region Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads are locked over 7,5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brie-Loudéac.
The situation of the secondary transaction networks in the Bretagne is very difficult as the foreign policists who were able to use the vehicle only in the case of need, and the use of some TER travel buses has been driven over the whole day.
In Picardie, school traffic was rejected for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the middle of the middle-group.
The prefecture "requests the vehicle to the highest precaution on the streets and to the appropriate adjustment of their conduct."
The General Direction for Civile Airport (DGAC) invited the flight companies to suspend 25% of their airports from Paris Roissy and 10% of the flights that Orly started due to the expected strong snow accidents.
The DGAB recommends the flight passenger to contact their flight company.
The Gatwick Airports in South London and the aircraft in Edinburgh, Scotland, have been locked until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skizzen
Since the debate on modernization of the economies in the Ile-de-France is fully, it is billion.
At least in discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris are called in memory to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To lead the start of the SGP in the ways, the State has called 4 billion euro capital rates.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would so allow to provide a part of the financial sums on the markets to their doubles.
Today it has come to the first high.
The additional budget of 2010, as regards the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures provided for for in 2010 to bring the first part of the money.
This is two measures: the creation of a special tax for the exemption and an enormous taxation of the offices in the Ile-de France.
First, as the article 15 of the Law project is adopted, "the benefits of the public-local Anstalt Société du Grand Paris".
"The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
Second, it is a reorder of the already existing company taxation: "to modernize them to increase the product from its produced product and to transfer this increase of the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
A race.
This sum is not affected in the text.
From the four billion, you're far away.
"The tax resources are to be refunded to the 4 billion euros of the capitalallocation, which will be established by the State and the Société du Grand Paris after and after the project," is to be accepted by the declaration.
In the SGP, this system is not supported.
"From the moment in which receipts (the two taxes, R.), you can cover the projection for three years and then create only from the four billion," it is explained.
"This is noted in the budget and after and after."
The SGP suggests that 2013 will be started to note 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This action, which will be able to search for four billion still long, is to make a rightly moved and parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be found on 7 December City.
Reconstitutive hacker and embarrassed spion
The WikiLeaks Affairs has a double importance.
On one hand, she has become an obvious scandal, a scandal, which is only a scandal in the Sinner scene, which rules the relationship between the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at international level, and gives a prejudice to the future dominated by regression.
But we're going to go through the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the activation of the fact that each act created by a secret service (a x-belious nation) is combined from journalizing exhibitions.
The "external" enths about the sexual habits of Berlusconis reject nothing more than what we have been reading for months, as well as in each x-belious magazine (except those whose owner is Berlusconi) and the terrible careful profile Gaddafis, Kabaret artists, has already been able to read from a long time for their sketch.
The rule that the secret folders can be consistent only from already existing news is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, not only in this century.
When you enter into a library that is distributed asthetic public, you will recognize that every work (over the Gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-chateau, the Templer or the Rosen Cruzler) is exactly repeated what has been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of Okcult texts does not want to publish research (including that he did not know where news about the non-existent) but because those who share the occultism do not believe anything other than what they already know and learn what they already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Like the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and the faul (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the secret service (only he could be anything, for example, the editor in Libération), who only considers true what he recognises.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the newsweek message in Rome to the State Dezernate, was the same as those who had already been the newsweek before.
So why was such an exhibition made about the enth processes of these folders?
On the one hand, these, what every person already knows, and although the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since the Governing Boss can call each other or take a flight to meet the dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have changed to Spain, except some small representative tasks.
Every person who observes research films knows this very precisely, and it doesn't happen from evidence that you do so to ignore this.
Yet, the fact to repeat it publicly lost the task of the clearness and serves to put the diplomatie into a bad light.
Second: The idea that a x-beliable hacker can cross the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world is the great fight against the Prestige of the State Dezern night.
Moreover, the scandale brings less of the victims than most of the "scanners" in trouble.
But let us deal with the deep-based nature of what is done.
Earlier, in Orwell's times, all powers were able to be bound as a big brother who controlled every geste of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy would have been able to express it as perfectly correct since every movement can be controlled by the phone, every active transaction, the visited hotel, the selected car and so further; the citizen would be to the total sacrifice of the power's eyes.
However, if you see what happens today that even the secret cryps of power can't get out of the control of a hacker, the control will stop to be aligned and become circle-formed.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as a citizen's refuge - can bring experience to the secrets of the power.
But how can a power be maintained that is not able to keep their own secrets anymore?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret can never be entheuted); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or labels is in fact a secret free from secrets, because it is the public spire pricegi; but in the style of WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to exalt them from every power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any Sarkozy or a mark wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this restriction that have been given to such a powerful power?
It is obvious that the States will not make any more information available in the future - that would be equal to one extent attached to the road neck.
But it is also evident that it is forgiven with the current technology to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and where a State boss moved in a flight and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and only for certain ears be involved in the future?
I know very well that my preview at the moment of Science Fiction and Romans sounds, but I see I need to imagine the government agents in a secret way that moves themselves into uncontrolled marchways, distorting their communications in no way other than in the memory only, and further the few written information they have received in the shadow.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed shooting: in fact, the spying trial of Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is going forward today as a cancer, namely rejected.
One centurie after the untrusted telegraph had revolutionated the communication, the Internet rebuilds a telegraph with (telephone) draft.
The (analogs) video cassettes had allowed the film researchers to discover a band film band by split from behind to forward and all the secrets of the mounting, while the (numeric) CDs today did not allow anything other than running from chapters to chapters, so in macroportions.
With the high-speed vehicles, Rome is moved to Mayland within three hours, while this is required by a flight of three and half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional that and communication technology return on cars and horses.
A last observation.
In ancient times, the press was trying to understand what has been prevented from secrets between the messages.
Currently, it is the message that requires confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France has its financial promises beautifully spoken
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the rapidly solved financing promises (a.k.a. "Fast Start" or "Fast Start" financing) which were fulfilled by the developing countries.
And the Great French beauty are already discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed 30 billion euros between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has spent 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (e.g. 420 million per year).
On the basis of COP16's exercise, the EU has made all rulers to convince their partners in the fact of their commitment in relation to the financing of fixed starts: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, large adverse events, brochure distribution.
The transparency of the operation is noteworthy and appreciated for its value: the developing countries and the civil society are pleased to see it if all developed countries did the same level of precision.
The EU announced that in 2010 2,2 billion euros have been released, which brings on the right way to comply with its commitment of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at detail, the things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and adequate" in order to ensure that the Copenhagen Treaty has been introduced an additional use without providing public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consciousness about what "new and social" means.
Since the Commission proposed a harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the right value that he is considered best.
For example, the EU Commission has expressed it as a direct value for those in 2009: the international funding will be maintained, and it provides more than 150 million for three years under the financing of "Fast Start".
Other countries have chosen similar orientation values, either for year or for conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France was the opinion that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and adequate".
Otherwise: There are no guidelines in the issues of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specificly, the total amount of French support in developing countries may remain stable (or also deduct) - France suggests to carry out its commitment in relation to "new and social funding".
Another, decided element is the decryption in S ́ and loans.
There is no rule on it yet, and everyone chooses his accounting mode.
Some, for example, France, are 1 € equal to € 1 spent.
Obviously, this is only hardly confused: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain rentable investments (oven times related to the emission involving projects based on more effective technologies), it is crucial to present the euro that is equivalent to an equivalent for a rented euro, and only the costs of the loan for the capital country should be calculated as an engagement (e.g. the equivalent of a rate).
However, France has nothing different in the meaning of the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, taking 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and spending 8,5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only EU country that loans are largely involved.
Germany requests 46% while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including otherwise) follow their commitments to 100% with S.
Otherwise, if the major majority of the European Union exposes 1€ to the inheritance of their commitments, France just gives 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Nice hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fixed start finance with a double wheat: a part with a further development of the action on the time and another part with the reality of the financial use.
France is able to believe that 420 million "new and social" millions have been issued in accordance with its promise and spending 36.1 million euros.
The Manipulation of the Financial Ministry (as it seems to have been Bercy who has done the work) could have a double negative effect; once in the EU (why do the other Member States continue with the Supplement, if it is?) and then in the negotiations that developing countries are not completely disturbing...
The chapter of the frauded financing is only a small question of relatively short time in comparison to all the debates on climate.
But it could be too much of the troops in the vast machinery of UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Like anyway, it is unnecessary to learn his lesson from this first year's financing.
In the first line, France could announce an amendment in its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of the respect for its commitments and the balanced justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could lead to the debates on the conflict of long-term funding (there is another, decision-making and currently discussed issue): it is not acceptable to the question of the "compensability" or the type of refunding of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be also progressive in relation to conflict issues, as it is in other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Ministry of Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, which will take place the next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement of France's fixed start and its vision of "recoverability" and the use of loans would be highlighted from the international confidence base that is necessary for further discussions.
Warning - Pesticide taken by Children
A child of 10 years takes different chemical substances over the day 81, such as a middle-week published by the Generation of Futures (executed movement for the protection of the rights and respect of the coming Genre).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of analysed tests not play statistically significant values, but illustration characters of the treated problems" were usually covered within four, of an approximately-year child to the food consumed and a cross-border time in the supermarchs in Oise and Paris.
These typical feed - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water per day - were examined as laboratories' naseries in the search for chemical substances, pesticides, sword metals and other damage substances.
The Tellerbie is low-measuring: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as potentially or probably cancer, and five as safe carcigen class, as well as 37 substances with endocrin-S-factor, include multiple institutions such as the International Cancer Research.
"If in the closer total of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually accepted substance are not exceeded, this exhibition is, however, very well, that the reality in which the consumption may be excluded of cancer substances or substances with endocrin S factor is adequately anxious concern," the union notes.
Only the butter and the tee with milk contains already more than the possible cancer residues and three sure as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormon system.
The appeal imported from Brazil, as a meantime for the eye, shows tracks of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green bones of Kenya, including in the mid-day where the tracks of an extremely prohibited insecticide have been detected in the EU.
Moreover, the hacksteak, the tunfish from the books, even the baguette and the cowgummi of pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water management, the analysis made the presence of nitrates and chloroforms light.
At the dinner, the lachstock was discovered with 34 chemical residues in the "the most rich" and even the plasticians used to cover the feed in the microwave was not unusual.
The conclusionary risk of this "shacking cocktail" for consumers is probably "undervalued", as it is.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) proposed, on its behalf, "a view of the difficulty of the situation" to introduce a moralism on the use of pesticides to stop the "adoption of civilization diseases".
In July, a series of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had identified the presence of 365 different residues identified in fruit and vegetable pesticides consumed in Europe, including 76 in feed.
