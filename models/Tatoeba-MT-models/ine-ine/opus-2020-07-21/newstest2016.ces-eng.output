When the Professor was calling, he admitted that he had shot his girlfriend
During calling on a narrow line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted the police that he shot his girlfriend and needed to come home to them.
Lamb suggested that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably disappointed, and that contacts for a dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a manually written message on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I want to get it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who loved me," was in a letter that signed Lamb according to the offices.
There was no doubt that Lamb, who made two online shoes for Delta State in Cleveland, Mississippi, would eat 300 miles to school campus where the police thinks he had shot the favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
The police officer in Delta State, Lynn Buford, said that university officers heard shooting at 10:18 last.
Lamb's made a court phone on the neck line soon after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for.
The day after shooting in the school, students and college offered to hide behind the closed doors, trusted authorities are still trying to handle what Lambova's motivation was.
The details published by researchers on the side of the state, students, and employees who knew it together created a talented picture, but probably a problem factor.
Students have confirmed that they were rejoiced in his lessons.
The police in G日er, where Printiss died, confirmed that he had no record in the criminal register or the violent past.
Schmidt himself included the Laba into the book he wrote, in thanking "beauty people" with which he shared a academic life.
Both of them acted on the college of social aids and history together with the other 17th college members and many students walked on the roofs at both sides.
Equally, inclination has occurred in the case of problems.
The student who highlighted Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed aggressive and disrupted, "as something wouldn't be wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, noted that Lamb told him that he was looking at stress at the end of the 2014-15 Academic year.
The Lamb already asked Delta State for free from health care, when he indicated that he had a problem.
And this year he was only two online cows.
Recent changes regarding the university workers were that the doctor on which Lamb was strongly working would not cause him automatically to become a professor assistant.
President of the University William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba was obviously suffering."
Lamb's not going to answer these questions.
After he went out of the campus, the police arrested his trail when he crossed the border of the Arkansas state back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself by the only shooter of the gun in the court of the house, sometimes had from his parents in Greenville in Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of Washington, Methel Johnson.
The car left starting on the street.
It wasn't soon why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew people who lived here.
The lamb grows in this country.
Lamb began to work at the university with 3500 students in the town, reading about 12000 people in 2009, and affected the landscape and hours of education.
He got a doctor in education on the yard.
One of the years old friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic, and funny man.
Carla Hairston noticed that she was 15 and Lambovi 20 when they met joint friends.
She was with her friends in the middle school, and he was the great elder boy who taught her to play a kytary for a few years.
It was a very hot heart-laugher at that time.
The heart of all girls has found as soon as it appears," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson.
Lamb and Printiss went along with information about the time.
During the new phone Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a circle house that was sitting with the ram of the river G.E.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Printiss, Shawn O `Steen, said they were dismissed 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"He was completely wounded," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was the best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he thought Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Printiss when they met Abigail and Abigail on the annual festival three years ago.
After all, they played random gigis together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and songs his own music.
Printiss was a health sister who worked for different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, barman and the opportunity coordinator of fun at The Julep Room, a light bar near Gezzaer, said that afterwards he saw Lamba and Prentiss on September 5, the road that Lamb entered on the kytar and the harmonic for an unreadful damage.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," said he.
We've been weakening and playing each other on a shot.
I mean, they both had a good sense for humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialised himself in the American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor in school.
He was married and had three little kids.
He studied at Emporia State in Kansas and was the president of the boy student club and the Government of students.
In Delta State campus in Cleveland at night, about 900 people, including college members, employees, students and members of the community, participated in the activity with swimming.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and Jeff Schnidt also participated in vigilia, during which the University assembly bought "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
In the middle, the school started again.
"We're trying to return our students," LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The writers for Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police now claimed that Lamb had made a phone on a narrow line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that it was a conviction.
Toys R Us plans to have less seasonal jobs
Toys R Us declares that they will not collect so many session works as last year, but the producers of children's games and products claim that it gives current employees and session workers the opportunity to work more hours.
The company also stated that it was planning at least 40,000 employees in business and distribution centres throughout the country, which would be reduced by 45,000 minutes.
The majority of the workplaces will be partly working.
The company declares that it will begin with the collection of residents this month, and the employee will be gathered during October to the employee.
While the purchases are far about themselves months, the purchases are closer and companies are prepared to take timely advantage of employees for trade and sales, for the transport and trade of goods.
Michael J. Fox's commenting on his 'randa' with Princess Diana
The "Return to the Future" Prime Minister was a great professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was careful even from personal debts.
"We were sitting in the district and waiting for the arrival of the king's family when I realized that the seat near me was empty and I found that princess Diana would sit there," he said in the trailer for the survey document, "Return in time."
The movie begins and I'm thinking I'm on the stage of something that could be called false rande with the princess of Wales.
"Return in time," is the document on "Return to the Future," which refers to conversations with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the register of Robert Zemeckis and the executive producer Steven Playberg.
The "Return for the Future" Prime Minister was 30 years ago.
Playberg said, "It's an unfortunately the best way for me, the document that was ever filmed."
"Return in time" will get to VOD, DVD and selected cinema in October.
Boss of the United Nations says there is no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "no military solution" is the conflict of at least five years of conflict and more weapons only deteriorate violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN Chairman again invited all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support the inclusive negotiation on the finding of a political solution.
Ban said at the Mediterranean pressure that he was planning to meet the Minister for Five Constant Countries - USA, Russia, China, British and France - in the field of the Valid Conference Ministerial Meeting at the end of this month for negotiation in Syria.
He planned that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers were "insolvable."
Ban invited five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and the unit shown in the reach of Iranian nuclear agreements in the crisis in Syria.
8 optional numbers showing that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to mark him as a person who often changes the views.
Others over their hands like an unexpected whisper.
And some are prepared for the implosion.
But if some of the republicans are trying to download Donald Trump from the top of the elections, they will not be able to do it.
10 of the last 11 national investigations show that Donald Trump is in the lead of a two-digital number, and some people begin to ask seriously what this means for the nomination of this magnate's possibility to deal with impossibleity.
Of course it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
It doesn't say that Trump probably wins the Republican nomination.
Experts indicate that Rick Perry's road to Herman Cain in this period of 2011 did, finally, did not one of them win the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why it could be in general options.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bushe and economic conservation -- Club for Growth knows the Trump for maintaining and starting to put their dollars on a station with the purpose of allowing it.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that the realistic magnitude is not only a mixing phase:
Trump's dignity evaluation turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the middle of June, Monmouth's vote showed that only two of the 10 republicans had a view of this real magnitude.
In the half July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six of the 10 republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three of the 10 say they have a negative view.
And these numbers are holding in the beginning phases.
After voting at the University of Quinnipiac, which was last week, 60 percent of the Republicans had a view to Trumpa.
Two thirds of the GOP electors would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the republicans indicated that they would be either "rejoice" or "rejoice" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 mentioned that they would be "founded" from his candidatures.
Only Ben Carson creates the same level of survival as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "forwarded" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next nearest level of surgery?
Marco Rubio was only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican electors claim that they would be "inconfortable" or "resoluted", if the favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Most of the Republicans don't see Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his injury and injury, 52 per cent of the Republican electors were completely claimed to think that the reality has a proper temperament for the president's post, according to the Monday vote of ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Senator Club of Iowa, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of the republicans believe that he has a personality of the leader, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
However, 44 percent believe that it does not have a personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 of 10 independents say that his temperature does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republican electors are getting to this point.
When they set up their students, the Republican electors think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question who wins the GOP nomination with the greatest probability, four of the 10 said Trump would be the best option, according to the CNN/ORC review last week.
It's a change from the late July when four of the ten met their money on Jeb Bushe.
Full publication: The GOP electors haven't had in the past the most clear Christian cow in the past.
This time in the past cycle, 4 of the 10 republicans chose Rick Perry as candidate officer against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitta Romney.
However, it is shown that a certain number of GOP electors seems the Trumpa campaign as an accidental.
Though the republicans were conceived around another candidate, Trump also hurts at least everyone.
Some teachers highlight that the classified field probably contributes to Trump is a lead, while the anti-Trumpow support is difused between more than twenty other candidates.
However, Monmouth's research at the beginning of September shows that in the hypothetic direct conflict between the Trump and the rest of the Republican candidates, Trump will be able to provide support.
It takes Carly Fiorina at 13 points, March Rubim at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jebem Bush at 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasiche, Chris Christ at 33 points at everyone.
He's in the dead bathroom with Ted's.
The only candidate that hurts him?
Ben Carson would lead over the business officer with 19 points in the hypothetic warrant of one against one.
The majority of Donald Trump's staff claims that they have already done their opinion.
The new CBS/NYT outcome shows that only over half of the walkers supporting Trump claims that its opinion is not changed.
It is obvious that it can change things, and no one can really say that he would never change his view.
46 per cent indicates that it leaves an open backward for change between candidates.
Though Trump's currently strongest against his outside colleague neurochirurg Ben Carson, the electors who consider their opinion finally would go two times more likely to call for Trup.
6 of the 10 Republics are officially agreed with the Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico in the announcement of his campaign, the immigration continues to be the main and central theme of conversion for 2016.
Some are afraid that Trump's nabubrilost distracts the keys of the Spanish electors from the Republic and the damage of rebranding.
But according to the new Monday review of the public change ABC/Post, six of the 10 Republicans claim that they agree with Trump in the issues of promotion.
It seems that until the immigration theme remains in the seven reflectors, Donald Trump will also remain.
The government's frustration reaches new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently reaching half support from the Republican electors, especially because of their status of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday vote ABC/Post state that they want a political outside than someone with government experiences.
And they're also very distressed in Washington.
The Vote of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iow a few weeks ago discovered that three of the four people in Iowa were frustrated in Congress, 54 per cent are "inconscious" and 21 percent "injured."
The Summit supported the largest part of the state of carbon payments.
Czechland gets more than 400 million.
In the first read, the sentence recording supported the Government's new above law, which adjusts the extent of the expenditure from the surface of the coal rate from the weighting company.
Minister Jan Mladek (CSSD) promised the deputy that, in addition, the budgets of the community were also obtained.
Previously, the opposition lawyers who feared that heavy companies wanted to sponsor strangers as soon as they would pay higher payments directly to the State budget.The first read supported the Government's new top law, which, otherwise, means that the State should achieve the greatest part of the expenditure of the expenditure from the overall weight of the coal from the weight of the weight of the weight of the weights of the company.
The State share increases to 67 per cent while the share is reduced from 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proposal also changes the way of calculating the refund for the increasing injuries that the companies have.
Amendment in neurosity payments must be brought to the State station of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
For the revenue of the budgets of the community, it must have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the payment must be higher.
In the preliminary year, foreigners received a total of 450 million crowns and 150 million crown budgets.
From the weight of the cold, there were about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns of the state.
Novela also calculates the increase of the replacement of the residual room with an allowed weight of 1000 corners per hectare per year.
The receipt of these corners will continue to belong to the strangers in full range.
The Ministry of the Jan Mladek Industrie (ChSSD) said to the sentences that the foreigners would receive a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The highest weight payments already determine the law, but the Government shall establish it by its regulation.
The replacement shall be calculated as a component of the quantity of the injury and rate for individual types of nervousness.
According to the Government, the change is, notwithstanding the possibility of a significant reaction to the current economy.
However, the ODS sentence Marek Benda warned that the establishment of the payment by the Government Regulation should not be in accordance with the establishment.
However, according to the Minister of Youth, there is no tax in this case, because the State is a deficiency that is a national property.
Payments shall be obtained only by the strangers whose territories are difficult to be affected.
In the case of the deep weights of carbon, three quarters of the foreign and the quarter of the state will be obtained.
The same condition will also be in the case of weight of radioactive hornins.
The part of the money that he chooses on payments from the burden will be binding.
For example, 28 per cent will have to be able to fix damage after weight or to ensure the backup service.
A preliminary criticism of the opposition lawyers, which claimed, in particular, that they would damage foreigners with difficulties and countries.
For example, Michal Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starosts) warned that heavy companies already want to sponsor foreign as so far as they will pay higher payments directly to the State budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the worst regions only so that the Minister of Finance improves the budget," said David Cadner (Show) selected in the Osteck country.
Before the growth of unemployment on Mosteck, she warned the lawyer KSČM Han Aulicka.
Cadner and Aulic were unable to refuse the new one, Cuchera wanted to return the law to the government to process.
The D report states that, according to the weight fires, the increase in coal prices will not be reduced because the prices are more than 90 per cent per period.
Therefore, those who are conceived as electrical or heatings should not feel the increase of prices.
"Now, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that weak organizations will compense the increase in the refund of efforts to reduce their operational expenditure, which would, in particular, mean the reduction of the number of employees," the Government recommends.
However, it believes that the increase in employment taxes are eligible.
According to the rapporteur to Milan Urban (CSSD) the keys to know the Members the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, mainly, the decision of the Government on the weight limits of carbon.
If the cartridge is weakening outside the limits, then it will have effects on the expenditures for the state and foreign, it will be highlighted.
Urban does not agree with the Youth that the decision on the cross-border limit on the Czech Army should be fallen until 2020.
The limits under the CSA should be extended, accordingly, from social, national, and from the external energy stability.
Happy will lead the Czech as a single, the seat of the weather.
All four Czech tenists will appear in the quarter release of the Davis bar in India on the table and this time each of them will most likely enter into the game.
Captain Jaroslav back plans that, due to difficult submissions, the whole quarter will be deployed.
In Dilly, there is a heavy and high wheel of air, therefore it is expected of the emergencies that can be extended to five hundreds.
We've got to take it into the road.
I'd like to expand it according to the time.
And according to how it will look, he said back at the train of the Czech election today in the Centre of Kumara Khanny.
With one team and the world's fourteenth Jirram's Great counts to Friday and Sunday two games.
At the position of the two probably run Luka Rosol and Radek Stepánek.
I'd like to be involved by almost everyone.
I've got it in my head, but I don't know, he said.
Another certainty in the Czech Republic should be held in the Saturday fourth.
It's just a question who's going to stand next to the experienced debrist, which has in Davis' hole in four bilingues 18:4.
Happy isn't it.
There will remain the possibilities with Rosol, or Adam of Paul.
"I really don't know who and how it will look," he returned.
It's decided according to two developments.
The variant may be Palaska, with the Great, surprised in the 1st round in the debt over Australia.
"He's in the debt," he said back.
In contrast to Australia, I'd say it, and if I'm playing, I'd never have the same effect that I've shown there since the second section.
"I am for those experiences and I would have brought a point," said the Palace.
The home seat is in two Yuki Bhambri (125. in the ATP December), who wined last week a challenger in Shanghai, where he struck the third and fours of the shoes.
Two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both are players of challengers and our own experience from ATP Tour, but many times we've convinced that the pockets in Davis' hole are not decided.
"He decides the current form, the time," he returned.
Wednesday-in-law two start at 6:30 SELČ and can be attached to time.
According to the suggestion, he's got a cup and the bullet's not under the cup.
However, it can be played in case of artificial lighting.
They've already blessed it, and it's just two thousand luxes, that's enough.
"There should be given to play under the light," he returned.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Ministers
From your choice, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very surprised
The new work, leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debat in Prime Minister's ́s'ons, and he will first have to cooperate with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will put the first of his six added questions shortly after the south, while its performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the lawyers.
In the weekly exhibition, he asked "minder divisions and more facts."
He also pointed out that he could scatter a few sessions that he would leave his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which comes after his name in the stain-cabinet and his emergency talks to the TUC annual convention.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the State in silence during the singing of the national hymn in the service of the 75th year of battle in Britain occurred a criticism of conservation of the missions and is the central attention of some stories on the title pages of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyna's decision not to sing a national hymne has reached attention
Mr. Corbyna's tongue said he would be "continue in respectful silence" and recognize "the King's airport in the battle for British."
However, a member of Mr. Corbyn's staff cabinet, Owenitenith, reported BBC Two's Newsnight that the leader would recommend the national hymn to sing "without a view" to his conviction that monarchie should be cancelled.
Almost twelve staff ministers refused to serve at the top of Mr Corbyn team, cited differences in economic, defence and occupational affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties supported him as leader.
The political co-ordinator BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "building" after Mr. Corbyn's name through its position in the European Union and the Governing Tax Limit.
Mr. Corbyl stated on TUC that the Participant Party had proposed changed advice to eliminate the whole idea of the dosage limit.
About a few hours later, Mr. Girl introduced the secretary of the stone work and debt that the "very" party had repeated the government plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 per £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Partial Party, to whom David Cameron has sent down for the last decades from his election as the leader of conservators.
The leader of the workshop, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has the ideas "z dava" to Mr Cameron's questions and has received more than 30 000 people.
The MP Islington North states that PMQ is too confronted and that it is too sustained as "prepared answers", so disturbed trade, and instead it promises that they are faced with important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges that young people face.
Mr. Corbyn states that Angela Eagle, a stone business secret, will represent him to the PMQ when he is not involved — for example, when Mr Cameron goes to the carrier.
He also left the idea that he would leave the final colleagues to go out for a long time, because he had been allowed to hear that the whole matter was still discussed with John Bercow speaker.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to remove from the "Punch and Judy" policy, which was often connected to PMQ, but for a few years later, he admitted that he failed.
Since their first sentence in 1990, PMQ was seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership and their position between the final MPs, although critics argued that they became a carrier and needed a long-term reforce.

Burberry's action was 0.9% above after the encouraged reports from the Rival Group of Luxus goods Richemont.

Controversial building got a trail.
Investor Praga Projecti e Investimenti considers the derogation of the decision as an anti-legal and will be revoked against it.
In contrast with the building that is to come near the Anesian coast in the center of Prague, they protested before the office of Prague 1 hundred people, also arose five.
In the decision, the Magistrat concluded that the construction law had been violated because it was not subject to all the matters of the territory decision.
"The present territory decision does not contain, for example, a species of lands, a distance from neighborhood buildings, sufficiently and comprehensively described by the building, the limitation of the territory of the construction affected," it is written in its decision.
It also considers that some funds for decisions have been issued for the processed documentation that has been changed.
It is, for example, the designation of the life’s organs.
Part of buildings must occur on the Territory of National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid agreement.
The written material indicates, however, that by the owner of the landscape, the project documentation for the border management was only agreed, not agreed with the position of building on its territory, writes the building order committee.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta from the investor company, the Board of the Constructional Rule did not adopt the decision of the overseer authority - the Ministerial for Local Development, for which the period for the start of the investigation has already expired.
Everyone's a scandal procedure.
"We've already prepared this project for seventy years, we have respected all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Revetto said in the printing report.
The project for which people have a strong emotion in Prague because of the fascist colours of fascists, calls for a strong emotion in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people have occurred in the past to protest against building.
By association and neighbors of nearby homes, some authorisations have been issued for a house that would look different for many years ago.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the building for the historical center of Prague and without the neighborhood of the English Castle.
The house proposed Zdenik Frank, the project changed sometimes.
The 2008-based spectacle of the project, which was calculated with a manifest fasad, refused on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NPU) of the Cultural Ministry and refused the authorisation of puzzle memories in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows to faces but the NPU and the Master memorandums were approved and a building authorisation was granted on this basis.
The author rejects the results of resistance, never counting with a fasad in a red color that gave a draft survival after a white sugar.
The Czech policies have been binding.
The magicians brought him to the base with them.
Berg delivered to Hungary with the aim of bringing humanitarian assistance to the rebels.
On the road, he took three Syrian springs in the car, which were likely wanting a half of the miles of the pools.
Then, according to this, it was not criminal in Hungary yet, he told people's newspapers.
We knew the law guards did not follow such acts.
But when the police stopped us, we were arrested to our surprise and brought us to the investigation connection in Zeged, he described the letter.

Metcash starts a campaign foreign to fight with Aldi's invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trades from Aldi's support in South and West Australia.
Metcash starts a campaign foreign to fight with Aldi's invasion
While Aldi is prepared to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 trades in South and West Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarketes strengthen the relationships with local food suppliers and build a IGA mark using marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA operators and suppliers are added with labels such as the Simmo's supplier for sales in the IGA trades and trade owners of the Australian Baltic Life to local clients.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the sales of eating, alcohol and hardware will celebrate its annual investor strategic day.
It is a lot in the ship because South and West Australia represents approximately 30 percent of Metcash IGA trade steps and generates higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the East States.
The clients in South and West Australia are nottoric provinces and IGA trades use much more market share than NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WW compared to about 14 per cent in East States.
Each analyzing, like Morgan Stanley, is that Aldi calculates 5 percent of the food market in these two countries during 12th months since the opening of the first trades, which have taken the markets from all existing players, but mainly independent minor operators.
This week in his report analytic Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, believed that IGA small business could lose 360 million USD on annual sales and Metcash 250 million USD at the end of 2016.
This predict is based on the presence that Aldi will open 25 trades in South Australia and 30 in the west during the next year, and will generate 500 and 600 million USD sales on individual markets.
The loss of food sales and the amounts in a strong price based by Metcash would be able to have it about 13 million USD on expenditure before the conviction, confirmed Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loss of markets in the East States, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the last review of Roy Morgan proved that the purchasers in IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sales of food metcash will decrease by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share is decreased from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the Hamish Douglass fund manager, the founder of Magellan's financial group, said that business dinners in Melbourne could "be very probably disappeared during decades.
Metcash refused publicly to respond to Douglass' comment.
But it is known that the member of the representation of Metcash contacted Douglasse last week.
The IGA market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent from 2010 and the food trade products of Metcash added approximately 1200 IGA markets have fallen by 43 per cent from 2012, which reflects the operational development of speculating changes because the sales and expenditure are under pressure.
However, big trade passed to the anti-appeal and invested more than 150 million USD annually in order to equippe the growth prices in Coles and WoolPropertys for hundreds of products every week and thus helps the IGA small trades to restore trades by adding and growing food and news from private people.
The Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, claims that the programmes for the comparison of prices and trades will take sleep and hope that the majority will return to the basic research growth in 2017 first in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis'a Stevem Healym
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behaviour more than critical.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a closer loss at a recent visit around his friend Nick Kyrgiose and served for his behavior more than critical, President Tennis, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest member of the talented dua often called "Special Ks", took an unwilling attention to himself by the afer with an ungodly known Kirgis and Stan Wawrika on Montreal Masters.
Soon, in the disturbing trial in Ciıinnati, they had to be Kokkinakis and his cousin Ryan Harrison two times separated, Harrison then said, "Wawrink had one to touch Cyrgios and I had to take him too."
In the past, he was seen how they broke the racket after that the clue saw him the possibility of Richard Gasquet to the US Open, Cockinakise unrepentantly deceived Healy.
The young man is currently located in Glasgow, where he will support Sam Groth on the location in the second two places behind Bernard Romanice in the semi-final Davis Cupu against British.
"I was very intensely thinking that Thanasi, according to my opinion, was a little thrown into the whole problem," Healy said.
He destroyed the racket when he was playing for the cry in the United States, but it is not the first player who would choose an input on his rakete. I know Thanasi quite well and I can say that this event will be horrible.
But he was very well controlled because he was made in the United States a very operational circumstances for Harrison and so further, so, according to my opinion, he deserves great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around herself, and he's got a great family around herself, and I think he's been arrested with him sometimes.
It's a very adult 19-year-old man, works very strong and in the team it's going to be great, and so further, he's never had a problem with the final players, he's very respected, he's trained strongly, he's in an increasing condition, it's a very stable and growing young boy, and I think soon he's deserving to be judged according to his own services.
Healy also supported the decision to review Kyrgiose for the important stock that begins on Thursday, and states that the "mutual decision" is a correct solution for all, but supports the parent from Canberry to return to the team as a stationary period.
"Now of everything we want our team to be completely focused on the ship and not on all the contrast that arose around him [Kyrgios]," Healy says.
And I think that Nick stood very hard as Federer, Murray and other people show, in the public growth, did also a few terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the results of his actions and the time outside the explanation when he will be able to think about it is, according to my opinion, the best solution for the team and for the same one.
European Crisis: Hungary is the status of the nutrition, closes the border and holds it
After announcement of the status of threats, Hungary closed its south border with Serbia and stopped those who tried to overcome its illegal transition so that the migrants would stop the impact of the migrants.
There was a chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants were replaced in the country, and the Serbian authorities reacted rebelly.
Those who have won for an unknown period of land feeding between two countries deserve those who flee from violence in the lands of families, build their dwellings and live their lives.
But there's a feeling of frustration.
When the helicopter is over them, they call together "Open the border!" and continues the classic unit of the Hungarian police.
Some people refuse food and water to protest.
The Serbian Prime Minister declares that it was "inadmissible" to be sent back from Hungary, while they are still more coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbs) He wants to be part of the solution, not just the right to take.
In the next days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic states in Prague.
Insurance at the Hungarian and Serbian border came on the day after the block of 28 States did not come with a single immigration policy at continued meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40 000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and talked about the achievement of an eventual agreement next month or the end of the year, which the EU's people would adopt more than 120 000 other imprisoners, in general Hungary.
The German Federal Officer Angela Merkel and the Russian Federal Office invited a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continental uprchlic crisis.
However, Hungary did not turn her back to Brussels or his neighbors.
The internal conditions of threatening in two Southern regions gave the authorities a greater authority to resolve the crisis and allowed them to close the road and to deal with the cases of azyl negotiation.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian Officer Peter Ssiejarto said that his country also plans to build a stream from the outbreaked road for the border with Romania to stop the springs that try to pass through their country when the board is now completed in Serbia's border.
CBS News co-respondent Charlie D’Agata announced that even those who have helped to reach the worst road between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past months, Hungary became a major weak and entry point to the European Union for appeals from which many have fled from the Middle East and other countries.
However, the President of the Government of Viktor Orban continued to say that most of them are economic operators who follow the better life and not war rebels who seek protection, which is a view that is different from the rest of the EU, mostly Germany.
The new laws that have entered into force on the north of Hungary now criminalize the destruction of the 4-metric border that the Government has allowed to put on the southern border with Serbia, and also sets a longer time in processing for those who are illegally translating the aircraft.
"Thanks of the caused massive mass of the Hungarian government declares the status of threat," reporters of the Zoltan Kovacs government in the southern town of Szeged said.
In this, we have completely: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technicals must still be authorised by Parliament to set up armies expected in the next week, but reporters have observed a hardly armed army with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's adviser for home defence, said that the authorities have captured 45 people who have tried to cross the border and 15 have already been captured in the country territory.
They have occurred through the damage of the plate, and they are now accused of rebuilding crimes under new laws.
Agencies have allowed the board to fix it.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven wooden transitions with Serbia in the cave after the use of a covered car.
On the main cross-border cross-border cross-border, the hazards opened a small office in the cow-container for processing and pressures of people.
There were about 20 inside, but thousands remained out of here.
Another group of appeals blocked the main districts associating Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Options 2016: Hillary Clinton's shock before Bernie Sanders reduced half in national voting
The former ministerial office keeps Hillary Clinton still holding a double-digital shot in the Democracy Division on the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders will get her shopping.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of democratic primary electors (increasing from 58 per cent), while Sanders is on the other hand with 27 per cent (17 per cent growth).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has to announce whether he wants to be the President, has a support from 15 per cent of the democratic primary electors.
More than five months before the beginning of the major competition, the most democratic electors claim that it is too soon to say that they are the decisions that the candidate will support.
But Clinton sponsors are more sure by their choice than those who support other candidates.
From the CBS News review last month, Clinton's ground was lost under the feet of some demographic groups, while Sanders got a few.
Clinton's keeps a big shot between women and smiles, but her leading is devoted.
Her support between men was very decreased and Sanders lost only five points.
Clinton's adventure with democratic electors under 50 years, and now they are with Sanders ro.
Clinton still has a big leader thanks to the elderly electors.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digital shot before Sanders between the liberals, but now Sanders lost it in this group only 5 points.
Approximately half of the democratic primary electors in all States says that she would overwhelmly support Clinton if she became a candidate.
The fourth would support it with certain refunds and the other 15 per cent would only support it to be candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's not surprising that Clinton's current injuries are particularly devastated.
The views are mixed between those who do not support Clinton at the present - just a quarter would help it overwhelmed.
While 48 percent of democratic primary electors say that it would support Clinton, less Republican electors say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's recipients are asked in the open question why they want it as a candidate, the most frequent answer is that he has the right experience (16 per cent), it follows that the time has come to be the President of a woman (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate for this work (10 per cent).
Clintons also mention their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Thereafter, a great choice and coincidence of problems has been cited.
While the Vice-President considers the potential candidate to the President, 57 per cent of the democratic primary electors would wish that the third would think that he would not be candidate.
When the primary democratic electors were asked to choose as a second option for the nomination of the party, the most common option is Biden.
Clinton's recipients introduced more than half Biden as their second choice, far before Sanders.
Biden will decide to ignore the nomination of Democrates, Hillary Clinton's leadership will be extended from 20 points when Biden will candidate to 30 points without his candidature.
Fifty-five percent of democratic electors see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunity to gain in general elections, but this number has fallen from 78 per cent of the last month.
Poor in this measure is far a second, but the percentage of people who see him as the most probably electoral is growing up.
However, when the candidate's greater importance has occurred, the democratic electoral gives the priority to solve problems before the first chance of choice.
Similarly, as last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate appears as an inadmissible candidate for these primary electors.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics between primary electors of their side.
Most of them see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as sincere and reliable and think they have strong leader quality.
The poor of all three is in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary electors don't think Clinton's honest and reliable, so two times more than those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent does not have this view.
Primary democratic electors also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in accordance with their ideological view.
As regards all these measurements, the quarter of democratic elections has no view of Sanders.
As the issues regarding Hillary Clinton's decision to use its personal email and server as State secrets continue, the majority of primary democratic electors are satisfied with its interpretation of this matter and say that their general view on it has not been affected.
But between the US public is a total different story.
The half of the Americans is now uncomfortable with her explaining, while only the third is satisfied.
The public opinions on this subject were divided in March, soon after this problem was found.
Most Americans claim that this email counterpart has no effect on their total view of Clinton, while 36 per cent of their opinion on Clinton was harmful.
It's mainly about the Republic, where more than 6 of the 10 claims that their opinion on Clinton has been harmful.
Although Clinton is expressed as honest and reliable among the electors of her side, this question is still a problem between the generally registered electors: only 32 per cent sees it as an honest and reliable, which is reduced by eight points from the last month, and 15 points from May.
Seventy-two percent of registered electors don't think it's honest and reliable.
On the contrary, 55 percent of the walkers registered throughout the country do not see Trup as honest and reliable.
But Clinton and Trump have good signs for leadership.
From six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush were best conducted in honesty.
Sanders see more people as honest than unclean, but, as with Carson, the electors did not think about it.
The dissemination of errors in the model 351 primary democratic electors is 6 percent points.
Ben Carson ended after Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest review of CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest research and the finals allow support to be granted.
The electors from a series of publics throughout the country continue to support the Trump Drive’s, and they have developed from 23% support in the last review of the CBS conducted before the Fox News debate last month, for 27% in the deterioration.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The investigation also made sure that Carson was able to carry out the demographic groups, and that it was designed by Trumpa between university-schooled Republican electors.
The residue of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorin and the State of Ohio John Kasiche, has fallen to the current 2% behind by Scott Walker Wisconsinian.
Ancient Floridy Jeb Bush, ex-Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florid Senator Marco Rubio are all together at the third place with 6%.
The broadcast of errors in the model 376 of the Republican electors in the latest investigation is plus minus 6% and was held in September.
The latest review of the CNN/ORC published last week showed that Carson had been asked and reached 19% of the support between the Republic of Tromp by 32%.
The latest review from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was clearly before Carson.
During Carson’s early trend, Trump decided to shoot the neurochirurgian in the service, and Carson even apologize for the votes of the faith of Tromp.
"We need energy," Trump declared last Sabbath during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood were accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during the overcoming brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder for five people was accused.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chun "Michaela" Denga during the start of the court in September 2013, and they took him into the hospital, which contributed to his death, announced the police.
The police indicate that he had a lifted eyes, had a full sand on the bathroom of a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly charged when he tried to reach the goal through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally tricked his head pain and then fell into unconsciousness.
The members of Pi Delta Psi Brothership didn't call 911 immediately after Deng was stuck, and they were expecting an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police forced.
However, they found time for Dengo's clothes to overcome, to evacuate his symptoms and to contact Andy Menga, the general president of the brotherhood, and to ask him at the advice, introduced the police leader Chris Vagner to the printing rubber.
"In this moment the members began to hide the equipment and, in principle, gave the benefit of brotherhood before the lives of Michael Denga," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't survive and die on the second day.
According to ask you, Deng was repeatedly shot by the dumb subject in the head, and stood.
"Too many families have been deceived in the investigation of brotherhoods and at least one student dies every year for the trip since 1970," wrote Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo's family, in the statement.
Brothership and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The major report of Monroe County recommended a third degree of murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be accused of the attack of disturbance and crime association.
"We want to keep not only the involved persons, but if there is a organization that has approved it, whether or not officially or unufficially, we will also receive them to responsibilities," Wagner said to the pressure pressure.
Baruch College prohibited brotherhood and national brotherhood rejected their relationship with local villages.
This will happen when Fed increases the rates
The growth of the rate will come and the market will be cut off, the rate of debt will be cut down and the economic will make it clear to the recess.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take it and how long it's gonna take.
For economy, it offers specifically the story of a small hole of time.
Recese came after 11 months after the first increase of the rate and was 86 months.
The agressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in increased rates is often, although not, which defines how economic and financial activity will respond.
This is why the American Central Bank officers have so highlighted so strong that investors should not be focused on the start of the increase of rates, but more trajectories, how normalization will take place.
There's more variables in the game.
However, the members of the market may finally ensure that all references to increased kvalitet may be overcome.
"For the increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will be unexpectedly interpreted to some as the end of the era 'life money'," said in a note for the clients Julian Jessop, leader of the global economy of Capital Economics.
In contrast, we do not expect that the progressive return of American rates to the current, but still lower, create a seismic shock that many could be afraid.
That means that it's going to come to the unprecedented.
Here is a view of how some economic reactions will be made on the basis of historical trends:
In view of what the market has mentioned in the last month, the expected increase in the rate of air can affect a little inconsistent.
But as soon as the increase occurs, it's so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend for the restart of action after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the prolongation in monetary policy again," the Deutsche Bank analyze in a recent study of what happens after the increase of the Fed.
Exactly said, the market in the last 35 years of the most often - approximately 14 per cent - takes to increase the rate in relatively areas in 250 days (medium increase of 2,6 per cent), and then returns to the normal status after 500 days, with a meaning of the last six cycles 14,4 per cent, according to the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main action strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published to Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the action has the tendency to be with a more significant rate in the cycle of increased rate and the return begins to be decreased.
Recese is a real economic life, but the increase of the costs often helps them.
At the current time, Fed is held to some of the subjects that haven't yet existed and who could adjust recessions.
The most attentionful is that a gross home product near his lowest point in the history by increaseing the fat of Fedu.
According to Deutsche Bank, the increase of rate from 1950 was only two times the nominal cross-border growth of HDP under 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3,6 per cent, there was little waiting for its destruction, when the third quarter was only 1,5 per cent, Atlanta Fed states.
Increasing rates in this complex economic background could be riskant and could be found a question: "If this time is different," said Deutsche.
Market participants were preparing for the growth of the Fed for the whole year and all eyes turned to the Federal Committee for the Free Market, which was held this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategy and economics believe that FOMC could approve growth at this meeting, the future trade indicates only the probability of 25%.
"In our study since 1950, all increase cycles have been in the super cycle of increasing the packaging effect with the HDP covering top of the beginning of the recess after the starting derogation," it is written in the report.
Instead, this was a significantly late survival from the worst recess during the sample collection period.
The current cycle is far the longest of those when Fed waited from the end of the last recess; the record was 35 months, now we are in 74 months and we continue.
The strong result was also voluntary, because the market expects increase in rates and the pattern is sometimes similar to what the action is used.
The difference is that the impact is more evident in debt than in action when Fed changes the policy.
The debt seems to change the direction immediately after the first arrival of the cycle of increase/reduction.
At the end of the cycle, the increase in debt results fall immediately," said Deutsche.
The Charles Swaba Strategy believes that increased rate causes increased rates between short-date debts, which equipped with a currency.
Debt with high results often work better in this climate, although "We are still careful about the exchange of outcome," she introduced in its analysis of Kathy Jones, a strong analysis of the fixed income in the Swab company.
It's interesting that Jones thinks that the markets are already adapted to the expectation of the Fed policy.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the reduction of inflation expectations, there are a few signs that the market has been adapted to the views of a closer monetary policy," she wrote.
The short rates are upward, the rental currency is more flexible, the credit expansion has increased and the vote has increased - all the market characteristics when Fed is focusing on the policy.
Generally, companies who perform their business in the United States win after the growth of rate rates and local products become more attractive.
The international company with many debts will be given worse because the growing dollar will make their products more lower in the World Market Area and their debt will also be more profitable.
"History shows that the "quality" of actions has the trend to convince themselves during three months after the initial increase of rate," reported Goldman Sachsve's analysis in the client report.
Companys with strong balances have achieved a weak development company in each increase in rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 in average of 5 percent points.
Communities with high expenditures, as well as with low voice resources, have also convinced their prospects of lower quality by 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become a big problem.
Goldman said that the community with a high percentage of the moveable rates will lose the most,
Despite pure action games, the needs also are difficult for the growing dollars.
Companions can also see their benefits through higher results, but experts have different views of how it will be.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, a strong lawyer Andrew Bingham
Conservate—Lord Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "deepuping"
He thinks who is more unrecognable than his business support
He also focused on BBC Music Awards and said he's just double British.
Sending college Damien Collins attacked the voice and he even says he's not a original idea
BBC Radio 3 "changing" in the Classic FM, confirming the primary lawyer and slow pressure to show that they do something they don't do.
Mr Andrew Bingham also said to the boss BBC that the audience station of the public service seems to be "deprecated" and is more unrecognisable than its business support.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "opuped" - but it seems to change to Classic FM," said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, started in the latest year.
BBC Music Awards, which started in the latest year, seems to be Brity with a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- that's two examples that attack me when you actually just imitate what we already have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director-General BBC rejected the accusation with a derogation that BBC Radio 3 is far from his business partner in relation to life music and public education.
What I learned about classical music at the 3th Council I wouldn't learn any other thing.
And their commitment to live music and creation of music is in a spectacular level.
"I think that the obligation of Radia 3 to find a new music and to introduce to new works in the operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, regulator BBC Radia 3 Alan Davey argumented that it is now necessary to work firms to join the public as before, because the British are less educational about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, which was obtained under a bottle for the shopping of business competitors during the sentence of Culture, Media and Sport and heard the Commission.
The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Netherlands Talpa Media producer for the estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is discussed as non-original, especially different?
Lord Hall held that the show BBC1 - in which the stars of Paloma Faith andBoy George as judges - were made by "type for BBC".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "found hit from his own stage" when he's next starting a fun series.
However, he refused to deal with more future series of the Order The Voice or the payment of the payers of license payments in other forms of divertance.
Internet sales grows at the latest temperature from August and on wine may be Black Friday
Private three months in 2015 7% growth online sales
The last month has been mentioned the latest growth since the year 2000 the records were started alone
Internet sales have been granted three years ago thanks to mobile purchase
Experts will say the Black Wednesday may be a deadly loss
More than the decades, the spring purchasing was a decade, and it has become a city of spirits from many British main streets.
However, experts claim that the marks of online sales are shown, and the new data show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for sulphine represented a lowest increase from the beginning of 2000, with a growth of only 5 per cent in comparison to the last year.
The experts claim that the marks of online sales are shown, and the new data show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth in the past years and go back to 2000, the status has been rationalised," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, the Index editor of the IMRG market index.
It explains that Internet sales were enhanced three years ago when the clients started using their mobile phones to purchase purchase.
It means that people were able to purchase online and that they were able to purchase purchase in different contexts, for example on the conferences.
Now, though, the growth is somewhere, so it seems to be dismissed.
The phenomenon of the Black Friday, which was taken from America, is quoted as one of the debts of the sale reduction.
The experts shall ensure that the applicants may maintain purchases before this event, which is last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times more than the middle of the purchasers returned to his computers to arrange the purchases and match several sellers' websites.
Professors shall ensure that Black Friday, thanks to which the purchasing re-compenses, can keep the applicants from other purchases
The version published by the British Retail Association Consortium proved that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For certain products such as television and sticks, more than the third of the sales are carried out through web trades.
More than fourth people buy clothes and bottles online, instead of buying in stone modal sales.
The Muslims buried the victims of the jail falling in Mekca, and the Bin Ladina family was sanctified
The body of 29 dead was transferred by the streets of museums in the first sepulchre in Mekca
Saudi-Arabian is partly deceiving wine for the Coups' magnitude of Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health noted that 394 people were also hurt after the rain was born
Hundreds of Muslims were conceived to be buried by 29 victims of burning in Grand Mosque in Mekca. The body of victims took on the street.
Being clothed in a certain measure in white, the triggers chose their way and gave up a victim when the first of the fallers arrived on his last journey on the bursts in Al-Moaissen.
The lowly message came around the sanctuary place, where a few days before the building was spread by the stroke of the mixture and switched up on the square.
The body was released for the funeral and the King of Saudi sanctioned the building group of the Ben Ladina family over the disaster, which also left 394 hurt.
The body of 29 dead after the jail falling in Grand Central Mosque in Mekca was born by streets
Among the dead was the father of four children of Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first road when the jail was risen.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of a yearly whisper.
The Saudi officers have already promised that the midst to Mekka would be a place, and thousands of people continue to come to the city.
King Salman stated today that Binadin Group shouldn't leave the brain of the jail up when he was not in the operation.
The Arabic version of the state of the Saudi pressing agency, states that Binladin Group is partly wounded for fall.
The public service of the agency did not report this detail, but noticed that the company's heads were prohibited to travel to the carrier.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what caused the wheat to fall into the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims cover before Hadge's road.
Binladin Group did not have any declaration on the collapses of the rail and were not provided to his representatives for a comment.
The king's statements have also committed a group not to use the latest security measures, and the lack of coordination with the officials.
Decades of Yerbabs are obscured by Grand Mosque in Mekca, which is part of the massive building effort in front of Binladin Group.

The company produces a new sesamâi and uses an exclusively unborn seed of the white seam.
We'll be able to pull our lis for an hour.
Mechanical lising is covered by sugar to maximum 40 degrees, and therefore the product complies with the criteria for extra female labelling.
In higher temperatures, the loss of survival substances would be achieved.
The sun’s songs in the heart and blood diseases.
The Czech favorite between oil is solar.
From the Jarmily Hamerské research, leading to the Masaric University, it showed that it prefers 43% of respondents in the warm kitchen.
However, it is not suitable for smiling, but at 180 °C it is started to be burned.
It is better to use it, for example, for although the salads are increasingly in the diet that helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It also contains a high part of the limit of 6 non-saturated fat acids, which mostly decreases the colesterol heat of all fat acids.
In heart problems, you must take attention to the quantity of totally accepted tube and calories.
For example, in one lie of solar oil, there are 62 calories, and in the liver of raw oil is 99 calories.
As regards the energy values of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with survivors are much more appropriate than those called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
That's why it's appropriate to go through extra girl oil.
This sunset will keep the same as the sesam and the conople nine months.
Storage in yellow is still longer.
The elderly people will know, in particular, according to the hot bullet.
On the contrary, he wasn't in the dark.

According to the most important people of American grills.
One household looks like 1,4 grills.
Then, throughout the world, there are various competitions in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
They're not even the Czech.
On the basis of Czech market investigations, we find that only 4% of people haven't gone into life.
Then the simplicity grills sometimes to the year.
In order to succeed, we can't undervalue preparation - it's ideal to modify the meat by marining a few hours before heat adjustment.
Which is the most appropriate, and the same is to avoid the health of prosperous substances when grilling?
Normally, when the grilling process is alone, it should be watched by a tuke.
The experts agree that a large part of the salaries begins to lose their pleasure at high temperatures.
The health of extra female oil is then also related to the body of a prosperous substance, which is otherwise obtained in consumption of food adapted at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra girl oil will not find their application.
Great for grilling, health and beautifulness.
When the meat is told, the Bohemia Olej's experts from Kraslic to Sokolovsk will immediately be made a terrible.
It's fairly worth complementing the milk of fish and fish.
In the kitchen, it is indicated that the unique property is to increase the natural hot food.
It is also suitable for smiling and grilling because it has a high degree of burning up to 216 °C.
Even in such a high temperature, as one of the small ones keeps the health of the well-being substance, described the benefits of the fearful oil Daniel Vlček from the Bohemia Olej company, which belongs to some of the Czech producers of this oil from the rave.
Professors agree that the threatening is 50 times more than vitamin E and 20 times more than vitamin C.
Thereafter, it contains a high quantity of oxygen liquor, so it is possible in combating cholesterol overleading.
In the gross oil, our body also accepts the importance of unused fat acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial volume of these substances, it helps to reduce the high blood pressure, increases the metabolism and has a positive effect on the renal.
The consumption of horrible oil also helps to increase our external beauty - improves the elasticity of the skin, uses it in the treatment of ace and helps to care for sucked and lame hair.
Boss, use of horrible oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for preparation of coated food, for example in the degree of salads, but also for warm food adjustment.
So when grilling, it can be used immediately in two ways, in marining and single grilling.
Maining meat and fish will keep their hazardousness.
In the preparation of marinades, there must be three folders: →, oxygen and root.
We add oxygen, for example, to the jabble octame, and we target the mixing of the flesh.
The roots add the mass of thickness and reserves and adds the right range, Daniel Vlček advises.
It also adds that the horror is directly ideal for marine, because as one of the small ones, it will be able to pull through the dark flesh.
So marin meat or fish are ready to grill, how to proceed?
Extra female oils are indicated by preparing food only a few coppers.
That's the same thing for grilling.
Some oils are for this way to prepare a perfect tab.
It seems, in particular, of lin, conople and rubber oil, which shouldn't be covered.
Before a single grilling, you'll be cut off with oil, you'll break the burning of eating.
The needed part of grilling is also the preparation of the Annex.
To the grilled mass and fish are practically practically practiced - grilled greenine, coated bread, easily green salat and many other.
Bohemia Olye, for example, recommends the Horke Salat Year.
To him: • 1 xs brochure • 1 hands • 1 hole of covered box • 1 box of salat sheets • 3 lying of horrible oil
In the salat month, add to the mixing of salat sheets with a thrown handhouse, covered wheels and on the big bones of a broadcast.
According to the bullet, you can also investigate the milk chi and the sodium.
Finally, take some of the capsules of horrible oil.
For the exceptional fun, then you can have a salat with a swimming middle.
Disappointed glasses: not only depends on leaks, but even on the cause of a patient.
Increased glass is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis cares about a number of professionals: neurology, physiotherapeuth, ergotherapeuth, urologist, oftalmology, psychology, psychiatrists and many other specialists.
However, it is not only for medical care, such as women with disturbed glasses of ≥ ≥ and coated, if they decide to have a child, to take care of these diseases, including social law advice, recommendations for the adjustment of appeal.
However, all of this fails: the development of the disease may affect the patient in principle.
How much more he will fight the disease actively, he can work longer, and he does not need to change his life in principle.
As physicians advise, the patient’s pasivity allows the diagnosis of the disease activity.
For example, it is shown that regular movement is significantly removing the time when the disease of the compensational help, for example, a hole.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not obey different myths, for example that the disease is automatically leading to the end of the vehicle.
This is why the page Give you Chanci (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the current media campaign Give you chance.
The most important person in the care of sickness with disorder skleroze is neurology.
In discontinued glasses, it applies twice to what the disease begins to be treated before, the doctor may also affect something.
It's because we have medicines on a disordered glass at a stage when the neurogeneration process is not yet so strong.
What we're going to do before, the more is that we're able to stop and deal with the invalidization, explains MUDr. Eva Med from Neurological Clinics The General Faculty Infirmity in Prague.
It is very important for people with disturbed glass of rehabilitation care, which most often resolves the weakness of lower ends or equality disorders.
It works with sick ones in accordance with their individual needs: to deal with the construction, improvement of the behaviour, strengthening the dominant day, mixing the poverty of poverty or improvement of coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the particular patient's trends," MUDr. Martin Kövari, Primary Clinky Rehabilitation and Physical Medicinal Facultate in Motole.
Although people with disrupted glasses suffer the same illness, they show themselves a little differently.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can mix its symptoms.
However, movement activity also strengthens the immunity status of the body, which is in the case of a disrupted glass of demand.
Another positive of regular habits is that sickness is to verify what they will do, and it strengthens their selfishness.
"In practice, endorfines are also exploded and a man feels well after it," advises PhDr. Kamila Rosa from the Clinics of Rehabilitation Medicinal Facultate of the King's Vinohrad.
By affecting the physical page, we act on a limbian system responsible for emotion.
That's what we include in mental and immune processes, and we stabilize disease, it adds.
"Before these patients were so-called, we know today that they have a target of harm," says Professor PaedDr. Pavel Collar, the Priority of Clinics Rehabilitation and Physical Medicinal Facultate in Motole.
The objective of physiotherapy is that man can stay as long as self-sufficiency, especially working.
Thus, the physiotherapeutics cooperate with the ergotherapeutes so that everyone gets a competitive help with the oath of him in peace.
Many patients also care for psychology or psychiater.
They're in hard life.
When a serious illness comes to your life, most people will get it out.
It's a shock, a panic, a fear.
He needs to respond to a big challenge - the loss of health.
With such a painful soul, we have to follow some of us, not trying to put everything on our own threats.
"I work with them so that they finally get to the conclusion that even with a handicap can live a full-valuable life and that a disturbed glass doesn't mean the end of life," says Renata Malin's psychotherapy - Schubert from Neurological Clinics General Faculty disease in Praza.
Without the Latecoere manufacturer, the airbuss were not flying.
The air production is a synonym of accuracy and progressive rubber.
New aircrafts are full of titan or easy and solid composite materials that nobody can soon produce and process.
Nevertheless, it is given to super-speaking machines computers, by cars to make composers to make something as usual as the mercury pecks.
In the bubble, which makes a bowl on the sugar wallet, the cockpit is cut off the feeding parts that just came out of the fresh machine.
"No one has yet come to nothing better," Ivan Dubski, the general manager of the airports of Latecoere, the Czech Republic.
In the street in the Prague Airways, Airbus A320 will produce a full door in the Airbus A320.
As the only world adds the door for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors whose part is in Prague are also traveling to the first and higher class on the top of the largest airport airbus A380 world.
There are also the doors of full composite for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
The precision is the main moto here.
Maybe the current keys allow the company to assemble two times a year.
In the pressure of the airbus or Boeing auditors, which run regularly to discover whether the doors are produced in accordance with the agreed rules.
People's senses, but the continuing technology hasn't replaced completely.
On one door to A320, there's 1500 news.
You have to screw the nitrates manually.
They take it two days.
Even according to the sound of the incoming card, they will know if it is already newly distracted.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The aircraft may exit from zero to 0.13 milimetres over the top of the airport.
It's a duplicate of the human hair's dual.
When checking, it's gonna come to a series of clouds.
When the controller goes over the finger after a number of news, he knows if there's some other tolerants.
Then we're taking the exact corner in the hand.
Airports lived before 1989 a program of the ordinary military airport L-39.
But in 1991, no one has been produced.
The company had to find new prohibitions.
At that time, the European Airbus Airbus Airbus was income.
He wined the selection procedure for the supplier of the neck doors for the A32 model
The negotiations with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were a small company that had not enough money for investment and that Boeing could guarantee stabilised supplies," says Dubski.
The doors of the American producer would remain inquired if the Latecoere Group of Latecoere would not have been involved in the Prague International Aviation Association in 1999.
I talked about our partnership with Airbus there.
The second day, there was negotiations with France, says Dubski.
In the year, Latecoere bought a Czech company and with a strong company came new prohibitions.
Soon in 2000, the assembly of the door parts for A320 was spread.
Three years later, the bottle doors came for A380.
In 2006, the company established a new hall for processing composite for supplies for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, they didn't get to those big prohibitions.
Perhaps they did parts or small parts.
Partners want to provide a guarantee for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubski.
Loni Czech Latecoere reached a turnover over 2,9 billion and a profit from 147 million crowns.
Exclusion of the position between the suppliers of airport producers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague since 2000 has invested 1.5 billion crowns.
The company shall have quality certificates, 170 special production processes and key employees certificates.
Without them, the business would not carry any door into the airport.
To obtain certificates that the production processes correspond to the requests of the clients and to maintain them in repeated checks according to the Dub million crown.
Certificate processes change each year.
They're more accurate and cool.
We need to train employees, make equipment and certifie the whole process again, adds Dubski.
The company now ends the preparation of the process for the treatment of wine and nine which will replace adequately for human health damage cadmium.
The tasks were obtained from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt to equipment or chemicals they used in Praza.
People from Boeing will come, check the concepts of the whole line.
Then we'll bring them the production.
They're checking our laboratory too.
One kind of patterns test themselves in their laborers and then the results compare with ours, approaches the Dubish way they are controlling.
The payments are the Prague Company's exclusions of contracts.
It's now with a praising bathroom, and it's falling in the production of embraces.
For A320 it shall produce half of the total volume of the door.
To replace the Czech Latecoere is impossible or very complicated for the Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, it doesn't mean that he could say any price at the door.
The part of the contract is a price currency.
This shows how much one door will stand after ten, fifty, the same cuts made.
The price for the curve remains to a certain limit value.
We have to go into this price pattern.
If not, we're going to buy, he says Dubski.
Half of the hail where electric boxes are completed for the Airbus A400 M military airport are then empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Here is a new semi-robotical line for the nutrition and mount door for the innovated A320 Neo model.
The nutrition gets out and swimming.
"This is the trend to mount in the airport," adds Dubski.
It's a future line assuranced.
Airbus reports that aircraft companies have currently negotiated 3278 cases of the new A320 model.
Only a few meters along, a line for the full-monting door for the top A380 bottle.
It's a strategic decision of our mother's company.
The goal is to reduce the production time and reduce costs.
The full mount could start within two years, says Dubski.
However, before, the company must carry out tests for the montage of some electric and electronic equipment to the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also makes further development of production from composite materials.
Besides Boeing should participate in the new Airbus A350, which will comply with the American Dreamliner.
"For the company it's a great credit when it can be processed outside the metal materials and the composite," he's proudly declared Dubski.
However, Latecoere is given to the food of production capacity in Czechland.
There's no other place in the airport where he sits.
Before the French mother's entrance, the company had 180 employees.
Now she has 800 and to three years, they could be more than a hundred.
As long as Airbus and Boeing will be predicted, how many hundreds of new airlines each year have been acquired, they must not be afraid of the work.
Although he has prohibitions for a few years ago, the mother's company of Latecoere's Latecoere's banquet threat.
The French group didn't have enough money for the money payment.
Finally, Latecoere was able to agree with the main truster.
At the end of August, part of their money changed for action.
The believers in the company gained an increase in EUR 57.4 million by 37.4 percent.
The company's debt falled at two thirds, so 180 million euros.
The second part of financial health came at the beginning of September.
The company requested a new action between existing actors for 222,9 million euros.
In total, the basic range of EUR 280 million was based.
Instead, the whole group is weak from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which share 85 per cent on the markets.
The average growth of the prohibition is expected of four per cent annually until 2017.
The prohibition book has negotiations for 2,6 billion euros, which corresponds to the four-year production.
The French media claims that Latecoere can finally get back on the cabs after years.
The Czech Conference in Prague Latvian is important for groups.
The group's markets contributes to 16 percent.
According to the number of employees, the largest workshop is.
The lawyers supported the most part of the state of carbon payments.
Amendment in neurosity payments must be brought to the State station of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
For the revenue of the budgets of the community, it must have a neutral impact, according to the government, because the payment must be higher.
In the preliminary year, foreigners received a total of 450 million crowns and 150 million crown budgets.
From the weight of the cold, there were about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns of the state.
Novela also calculates the increase of the replacement of the residual room with a permissible weight of thousands of roots per one hectare per year.
The receipt of these corners will continue to belong to the strangers in full range.
The Ministry of the Jan Mladek Industrie (ChSSD) said to the sentences that the foreigners would receive a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The highest weight payments already determine the law, but the Government shall establish it by its regulation.
The replacement shall be calculated as a component of the quantity of the injury and rate for individual types of nervousness.
According to the Government, the change is, notwithstanding the possibility of a significant reaction to the current economy.
However, the ODS sentence Marek Benda warned that the establishment of the payment by the Government Regulation should not be in accordance with the establishment.
However, according to the Minister of Youth, there is no tax in this case, because the State is a deficiency that is a national property.
Payments shall be obtained only by the strangers whose territories are difficult to be affected.
In the case of the deep weights of carbon, three quarters of the foreign and the quarter of the state will be obtained.
The same condition will also be in the case of weight of radioactive hornins.
The part of the money that he chooses on payments from the burden will be binding.
For example, 28 per cent will have to be able to fix damage after weight or to ensure the backup service.
Today, the opposite lawyers have criticized, in particular, that they damage foreigners with difficulties and countries.
For example, Michal Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starosts) warned that heavy companies already want to sponsor foreign as so far as they will pay higher payments directly to the State budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the worst regions only so that the Minister of Finance improves the budget," said David Cadner (Show) selected in the Osteck country.
Before the growth of unemployment on Mosteck, she warned the lawyer KSČM Han Aulicka.
Cadner and Aulic were unable to refuse the new one, Cuchera wanted to return the law to the government to process.
The D report states that, according to the weight fires, the increase in coal prices will not be reduced because the prices are more than 90 per cent per period.
Therefore, those who are conceived as electrical or heatings should not feel the increase of prices.
"Now, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that weak organizations will compense the increase in the refund of efforts to reduce their operational expenditure, which would, in particular, mean the reduction of the number of employees," the Government recommends.
However, it believes that the increase in employment taxes are eligible.
According to the rapporteur to Milan Urban (CSSD) the keys to know the Members the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, mainly, the decision of the Government on the weight limits of carbon.
If the cartridge is weakening outside the limits, then it will have effects on the expenditures for the state and foreign, it will be highlighted.
Urban does not agree with the Youth that the decision on the cross-border limit on the Czech Army should be fallen until 2020.
The limits under the CSA should be extended, accordingly, from social, national, and from the external energy stability.
Time for decisions on rates for the United States Federal Reserve
The whole world follows how the American Federal Reserve is going to meet within two days in the middle and Thursday in order to achieve the principle decision on whether the rates should be increased first after the decades.
A review of 80 economys held by the Agency Re©s has made sure more than half of those who believed that the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for a period of time and leave the rates within 0-0.25 per cent.
It's a historical event because it's been sitting a year from the moment when Fed's decreased the rate to zero.
First, we draw close to the approach when the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero late and start the normalization process of rates," says Angel Ubide, the leader of Peterson's International Economy Institute.
The American economy has been very well, it has achieved a reduction in the form of adding a billion dollars to the state and creating only a low level of inflation.
Yet, Fed can't ignore less raw global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared to increase, but the circumstances convince that they also see great opportunities against this step.
The decision shall be notified at Thursday 20:00 TEC.
Shoot at the State University of Delta left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and after the same day and her colleague - wrote a message that he claimed that he was the first murder and that he wanted to take it back, they were found in a devastated government office.
The Police in Göer in Mississippi stated that Lamb, a landscape and social artist at Delta's State University, called the police on Monday about ten hours
And he said he shot someone.
The lamb asked the lamb to send the police to his house.
He said, "I have shot my wife tonight" and he also changed that there is a "smoking dog" in the house, which "no one will be scattered," but is disappointed.
The police asked the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't represent.
The lamb also didn't explain why it was shot in the house.
When the police arrived in the place of the work, Amy Prentiss’s 41 - year body and manually written message from Laba was found: “I am so sorry and I want to get it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After left the message, Lamb delivered 300 miles to the Delta University, where he killed the factors of the history of Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Thanks for the University of William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "in Mr. Lamba's head was obviously played."
Despite the Monday statement that Lamb was evidently believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prentiss with Schmidt, the Governing Body stated that the "friendly triangle" does not exist "no evidence".
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married with the Printis's wife over seven years, stated that she was a "good person".
Divorce was 15 years ago, but they both remained friends.
The 19-year daughter of O'Steena and Prentiss was all the case "attracted".
O'Steen said that Printiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, nearby friendship of Printiss, as Sun Herald introduced, the Printiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that the Printiss, who had a lobby dog named Blesk, walked with Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help the last," she let Knowles hear.
The police noted that Lamb spoke to his family on Monday and said, "it will not be done."
When the cops reached him to the hall near Greenville even night, Lamb stopped and fled into the forest where he was shot.
According to the bicycle that published on the school sites, Lamb got a doctor in the training campaign at Delta University in June 2015.
Stars who lost their bottle
Herec (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right) has a few stressing years behind him.
In 2001 he struck with leukemia and in 2009 lost his age partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer.
Heric also had a particular drug problem and was arrested for drugs in 2008.
All of these things will certainly choose their tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months from the game for a double breakfast.
Luke Shaw suffered a double breakfast of the right feet during the destruction of Manchester United in Lisa Mysteries against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left round left this hurt in the ladies and set it out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The damage caused an unconscious step of Hector Moren in 15 minutes when the twenty-year-old Shaw went to the PSV room.
Nine minutes were treated on the throat and was also needed a oxygen mask before it was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double breaking of the feet and now he's in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's a terrible -- the guy who comes to Manchester in 18 years is very hard, but plays fantastics and then happens this.
When he was in the woods, he also had a designed oxygen mask.
Placal.
I'm not a doctor, but a double broken feet requires six months of treatment and can play in a group phase.
I believe this season is still playing.
Moreno had great happiness that he didn't get a red card and a penalty head.
Mexican Nicola Rizzoli decided not.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian decision was missing.
You can judge whether it was the penalty and the red card.
It was a very worrying step on both feet.
Tweet of Shawa says, "Thank everyone for their news, the words can't say how devastated I am, my way to delay begins now and I'm going back even stronger."
Relative: Manchaster UnitedMenually Luke Shawa hurt against PSV
The transparency will have an additional motivation to delay in the form of Europe's mystery in France in the next July.
Phillip Cocu, Dr. PSV, said, "It was a very painful hurt."
When any player goes out of the game with such a hurt, everyone is very comfortable with it.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the opposers.
Moreno suffered the breaking of the feet at the Mexico department against Van Gaalu Netherlands for the mistership of the world in 2014.
"It's very hard for-- because his intention is not to hurt the player, and when you hear about the seriousness of such a hurt, it's not good," said Cocu.
I wasn't able to watch this moment.
I just saw the meat that looked on another direction, so it seemed to have touched him [Moreno], but I didn't see Luke's step.
In the conversation for SBS6 Moreno said, "I know how he feels, I know how difficult that can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm sorry.
PSV player Andrés Savedo was also transferred to hospital after Chrise Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: When the child loves the book, he does not take it before he learns to remember it almost.
But you shouldn't be David Cameron.
On the question of the suppliers of the children's schemes to name a favorite child book, he chose the president of the Government of Lorax, a battle from Dr. Seusse of 1971.
It was difficult to choose, writes Cameron in the news published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Soft, famous, creative and strong content, I read it to my child because it was a picture or message that I hadn't seen before."
Well, then, in the following paragraph, Cameron described the books according to the exhibition from the film from 2012, which added additional positions and details to fill out the structural original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville the wall, where all nature has stopped existing, and even the air is a comodide, the boy named Ted hopes that he gets the heart of your dreams, Audrey, fulfilling his desire to see a tree," is a structural content of the book that refers to the object of love that is not known by Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Theodor Seuss Geissel, who died in 1991.
Jacoby was not alone, the text added to Cameron was read as a comprehensive exhibition of the Lorax film, located on the Internet Movie Database, and started the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville the wall of the wall, where all nature has stopped existing, and even the air is comodious, the boy named Ted hopes that he gets the heart of your dreams, Audrey."
Because he was open to a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron wouldn't have met with the book where a young man named is learning that local nature devastats the cowboy, the coaching woods of Once-ler, which, even through the protests of the title Loraxe, the deceased, the primary face, who "speaks out of the trees."
With the greatest probability of that relatively small PR task, the assistant who never had read Lorax to the child 20 times in the kid.
The Downing Street stated that the text was probably coming from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without another comment.
Adam Lyth was in the threat of England's reminder, but he still keeps
To support Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after the team that England has chosen on this tour, I think it will be not too probably too probably.
I wouldn't be able to exclude the exhaustion of guests.
Page Alastaira Cooka can be less experienced than these three years ago, but there is a good spin player in this packaging building and also a collective thinking is strong; they will not bring the juveniles from 2012, only the youngest positive.
Moeen Ali is developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although it is unknown at the level of the experimental series, represents an attractive option.
Absolutely: Adam Lyth went out of the team of England in a series experiment and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lytha is a strong trial for me to analyze because his main trainer is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests standed against two good attacks in a simple submission, but the reality is that they are the crickets players based on the execution.
For example, the name of Joe Root was no questionnaires, which led to an announcement, because — and this I already said before — players are their best electors.
A few more half years later, and Lyth could continue his series, but he had control over his own judgment.
Let's hope that if he gets more running for Yorkshire, another opportunity will be opened.
Vola’s trainer England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performance were not completely gradual, and it doesn't surprise me; it was a team player.
A question of how much temptation time a pair will get to be shown is a strong orchard.
Lith received seven chess — just as Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance home and outside.
The only thing you could pay is that England gave Jonathan Trott the first chance in Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this disgusting opportunity is the past.
Alex Hales comes and it's a cart that I'm worth very positive.
It's a x-factor cricket player we've seen here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he got 236 on the Trent Bri, which did so little.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this will, of course, depend on the total composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts on the side of Cooka, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was overtaken and I have no winning against it.
I don't understand why the strikemaker can't burn, and this left man already showed that he's a famous cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them, and the large share is not in it.
My former team colleague Justin Langer first played 38 tests before his exhibition in 2001.
The three centuries he was once and he didn't even look at him.
The team comes to Zafar Ansari as a basic spinner, and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he took me as a very powerful young man.
People can look at his bursts — a middle of 31 with a sword and 35 with a sword — and I see it as a sword, but it is not with spinners who would lift up their hands, and the electors decided for young people.
It's a lot to learn about this tour.
Despite the team, it seems that England has made a few changes and wise completion of their training staff.
The name of Mahela Jayawardenea, Mr. Lanka's pilgrim, as a conquest for experimental stocks can be a mysterious tach.
He is one of the most beautiful guys who will bring rich experiences by having experience with all submines and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the white-ball tour and brings into the team as energy, so unfriendly ice.
I always felt that he was born directly in the world of international crickets, either as a player or a trainer, and like Mahela has a intellect to be used.
The new voices in the swimming, although these are the voices that say consistent things that have been spoken before, sometimes can delay and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham Ben Stokes' co-operator has received a single day freedom, just as Root has received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many of them are wrong, trainers and electors do not create a harmonogram.
And you need to remember, as players, their work is based on outcomes.
Such decisions can never be able to take a easy weight.
The campaign Brexit could win if the economy continues to stagnate until 2017.
The undetermined strategy for the renewal of David Cameron for British breaking in the EU is in other problems with each next day and without the choice of the genial Jeremy "Is this Yes or No?" Corbyn will come to the head of the Partial Party, or the TUC will take the whole rate around Europe.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
The close friend of the European diplomate has recently explained how Europe is attacked in various crisiss - from which not all are their wine - some Member States have already enough British egocentric agendas, shared concessions and rush changes with which they did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they wouldn't want it even if they had a social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's self-agenda.
The Prime Minister and Officer go to summits or bilateral meetings in the metropolis, make a place before a celebrated local monument, with or without local evaluators, and then return home with the words that he wins a community for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants British unexpectedly in Europe - "Do not hold us alone with France," says Berlin - indicates that some short-term ministers and officers in some major cities have reached the point where they do not care about our department.
Angela Merkel, a German carefully balanced officer, is a associated officer, but she was at the power of 10 years and wanted to leave her post before it becomes bad, as it was in the way of that that was too far from thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohla (16).
Francouz François Holland shall be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
His power is also falling.
Poland may have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to look at how the feet of the Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to defeat Scotland in the UK department - which is something they don't want because they have similar separatist trends.
So some of these ministers can plan significantly unusual notes of the SNP during the campaign before the Reference 2017 in the United Kingdom to accelerate the Brexit process, a strong friend.
"Repeat negotiations have resolved a problem" and "Brittanny has nothing worth the negotiation."
Europeans for their own understanding how the Fleet Street can be and how skeptics in the EU are printing oligarch baronies because they have not been under the reference to Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in proportion 2:
They can remember motherly the name of Boris Johnson, an extraordinary Euro-portunist, who made his name coby the Brussels reporter "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the ninety-years.
Although Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
Included the salaries of unpaid taxes, foreigners of hacking phones and pseudo-free departments that owned the size of large news.
Tony Blair thought about them the same thing, but he realized that when you're in the hole with a gorilla, you've got to cut the bananas to not get you to the evening and then to the tea.
In the event, Miliband was more like Blair than the single Blair, when he opposed Cameron's reference routine since the time that Blair authorised the principle of the EU's constitution, which was devastated by French and the Netherlands electors in 2005 and received a card of exhaustion.
The print never forgave him.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who made me a friendly pleasure in Westminster on Monday - I told him that I shouldn't lose time for me anymore - it seems to be in the danger of readmissing the strategy of the poverty of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake at that time and now.
It may be a long time, but it is to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but of course with Andrew Marre, whose steel was left by BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official position towards Europe, I'll say it, it's going to develop.
It claims that he wants to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, a lot of people outside Ukip's disappeared trend and the birds of Tory's small Englander's beasts are certainly able to reach it.
The same she said Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn in the TV and this week when his internal shadow could not decide to admit Corby's name of the Abrasive McDonell as a stain office was a bad decision.
I remembered that in the 70 ’ s when his old father was fighting in television for his loyalty, without going too far and lost his job.
Hillary's attack was much more attractive.
But fighting for it, and they remained "in all circumstances" - Bennina phrase - according to all, it wasn't what McDon said or what JC said to colleagues and missionaries on their private meeting on Monday evening,
Whatever background it is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to communicate - Don't forget, touched me too - the discipline of messages remains important in the entire day TV transfer and, especially in the faith, the paranoia and the forrads that are social media
It is fair to not give Cameron free access to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Partial Parties in the reference campaign, of course, as McDon.
Simon Jenkins thinks that.
But McDonnellov and Corby's basic dealing about membership in the EU - in accordance with their Bennite's sustaining economic, anti-capitalistic past - no longer is the only question of the exhaust debate between the left disidents for which the narcism is the central base of dogmatic hazards.
Like with his handling about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign wants to end - the diplomatic will try to understand the meaning of all of this for their home ladies.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose a political position - also have suspicious elections - because of the concess of British, when it seems to be uncomfortable?
The United States have already been completely dismissed from the British "swak military execution in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in decreasing the costs of conserving the government at the power, as I was noted on the Monday start of something that was called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticize reviews on the public health agency
The statement to the Government financed by the agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safeer than raw, has occurred from meetings of 12 people from whom some have a relationship with the tobacco industry, refers to researchers.
The British Medical Journal experts (BMJ) joined Lancet the criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health England Agency (PHE).
The PHE Agency published the "green" message last month and described it as "complete evidence review".
However, some researchers doubted the data content and warned about the connections between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
The leader in the Professional magazine Lancet last month attacked the "mustly chatting base" on which the PHE agency founded its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ have doubted the statement that was indicated "scaleed on a scale or a fish."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London High School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of integrity."
It indicates that the public could expect that the PHE Agency's statement, which sounds "the current best estimation is that e-cigaretes are about 95% less damage than raw" are based on detailed evidence and modeling.
This conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 persons authorised to process an analysis of decision multicriteria (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on damage associated with different products containing nikotin; the results of negotiation were included in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose general manager has already received financial rate from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also authorised the approval of the public health of the BAT in the sustainability report.
One of the 12 meetings admitted the financing from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the financing that was dataly received from the Philip Morris International tobacco company.
D· for the selection of members of the panel is not available but contains a number of known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also reports about industrial financing in the news.
Some other presents on the meeting are not known for their professional knowledge in the fight against the raw.
The meetings in the PHE also participated in the tobacco leadership.
The report appeared in this group "recommended promptly," which missed "fortunate evidence of the damage of products for the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, no of these links or restrictions is described in the PHE message.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE statement that "not yet there is any evidence that the e-cigaretes would act as a way to rain for children or infections," it was preliminary.
Professor Kevin Fenton, manager of health and well-being in PHE, stated that the BMJ statement was already answered before.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less damage than smoking."
One of the two livelihood boys will die for his dependence.
All evidence indicates that the health risks represented by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we need to continue to examine.
PHE has the obligation to inform the public of what evidence shows and what they do not show, especially when there was so many public payments about relative dangers in comparison with the tabac.
Approximately 80,000 people will die annually with a disease relating to raw and smoking costs NHS £2 billion per year.
The clear evidence of the present evidence - even though e-cigaretes are not without risk, only the fraction of damage caused by raw - we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, the former manager Channel 4
Ancient director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his business rivals would "give the right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license payment should be used only for programs that are not created by other British television transmissions.
The BBC criticized that she had set up public services programs that would probably follow only the harsh people, to the complicated sentence of time, to deliver his rivals "the largest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the general director of Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was unfortunately trying to connect to BBC for six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I am thinking that BBC provides and sends programmes that would certainly be sent to rivals without the State's contributions," Johnson said in the Communication Committee in the Upper Commission as part of the BBC's future negotiations.
If you keep license payments which I am not sure whether they are in the Mediterranean or in the Horizon of Good Things, the creation should be reduced at least as regards programmes that other people do not produce or do not determine.
They send the Voice in the main sending time because they want to get the widest of my support to the future.
The idea that nobody else would send him is a funny shit, and it's probably insensitive.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why the tax returns should support programmes that can be financed without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and comprehensively produced on the home ground.
Early other channels would give them the right hand quietly.
I can't understand how these public sending services are.
I don't think that BBC would be weak at least.
Johnson, a businessman in the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC feels guilty of the rattings "for the ambitions of people who worked here, and because he believed that it was the best way to ensure support."
His comment on the most famous show BBC repeats those who were the former executive director of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart Lection in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest BBC sell show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the closer BBC public service programmes "come to BBC4, where they can't often be able to distort the community, but they are able to comply with their rights and are able to argue if they want their secret mission to justify £4bn income from license payments, "But, of course, we do all these obscure programmes on which no one looks."
They're sending them in the time when no one looks at them.
As regards the license payment, Johnson said to the Commission, "I call you to find the more regressive system about who will get the best value.
We all think that 150 British frees per year are a great amount, but for people who are 150 litres a lot, I would wonder if they pay so much because they don't say so much to BBC.
The former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who came before the committee, said that BBC should revise his Reitox mission in the meaning of "informing, education and bathroom."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now classified as educational - it was 1% of the TV production and 0.1% in the day - and it should be taken as a pattern of public transmission in Australia and Canada and changed to "inform, explain and enjoy".
To the theme of the partnership Elstein said BBC should do more in the areas such as Proms, which were sent in the television, and connect to commercial journalists, and everyone could see them online.
‘Son’tics’ or the control of brain cells using sound walls
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction to which glacists move.
Scientists grew up with geneticly modified nervous systems that can control sound wings.
The rare glasses change the direction at the moment when sound impulsions are inconsistent for human ears.
The pulses work so that they change genetic cells of modified motoric neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound wings.
Relative: Scientists can read and record the brain activity using light
Scientists have noticed that these reds are a great demonstration of the new sound methodology called, which uses ultrasound for the activation of brain, heart and swallow cells and is active outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, stated for the Guardian journal that one day this method could replace the deep brain stimulation - invasion and procedure in which the patient’s brain is driving electricity that stimulate the brain. The method is used for the treatment of Parkinson’s symptoms of disease.
The glucose normally doesn't react to ultrasound, but Chalasani assured that the reactions would be made when it was placed in the liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, the bubbles strengthen the ultrasound wings that then pass through the body of red.
Silent ultrasound wings are active in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of some red cells.
The sound wheel opens and actives the cells with which they are connected, in the report of Nature Communications.
In order to control glasses using ultrasound walls, Chalasani geneticly modified reds so some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
Then when he used such modified blue ultrasounds, the sound wings were mic bubbles and were transferred into reds where the modified motoric neurons were enabled.
The new method is in many ways like optogenetic, prognostic tool that allows the doctors to switch and disable neurons with light.
But Chalasani was allowed to hear that songics could have much benefit from this technology.
In the section of the light that must be sent by optical flash to the requested place in the brain, ultrasound wings can cause a fluid without restriction and be directly sent to the brain.
"We believe that when we use genotherapy and therapeutic virus, we can enhance human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that its application would also be found in the treatment of sval cells and cells producing inpoetins.
Illegal mucking equipment - right on your dust!

See the video on the anti-weapon market from Amnesty International.
It's a dangerous murderer drone!
Eye on the feet that the knifes are laughing!

And electrical turning wheels that cause inconsistent pain, but doesn't recognize any tracks!
The joyful voice and the carrier of metafor does not allow anyone to doubt that this public on the largest world leaders of weapons is a hard parodie created for Amnesty International in order to highlight the will of the British Government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defence and security of the International Veselice Centre in the London quarter of Docklands.

In the printing report, Saab discovered a statement from the American Army to "on the AT4CS RS burning frame".
This includes "uniquely creative heading, which provides possible effects outside the burning inside the goal."
Whatever it is, it's nice.
Eight gold rules for life for students
11 years ago, I moved to a student's train as an incredible ninety-year-old boy, still in barth and moral relative, but now I make up the smiles of those whom I had led - and the fair, long-term complaints to the other.
All I learned can be destilled in eight simple rules.
Running on the rail can be moved from quietly to the nerve that goes to completely disturbable.
It's a healthy blubolit: tell people from where you are, if you've taken a year of pause, how you're thinking about Corbyna, and why "You don't really love Marmite, nor do you just hate Marmite, because people, it's just an outcome from the hahaha, I'll be at myself in the room."
Get the depth up.
And help the last ones to get up - ask and show interest.
They'll help you find the people you have, and those with whom you wouldn't have fun if your rows were in one fire, and they would have issued the hazardous devices.
Let's get the room.
The rooms of people are often changed to drinking receipts, film evenings and public places, but they are also rooms in which people are clothing and adjusting their beach.
Relative: Don't even think you'd start walking highly and be in relation
Introvery will come quickly.
Your room should be an attachment, though, with the series of trips, it is changed to a non-satisfactory progress culture that is friendly, social and contributes to a whole lifetime friendship.
It can be a peak for someone who's going to buy.
No culture allows you to say, "I have you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you go to get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when the companion is deceived from socialization - and maybe you write him a place of claim.
When it's a word of clothing: cry.
One boy in my race was in the habit that if the door is not closed, he's invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make your friends grateful to you.
Because you've started walking to the university at the top of the cups of a manna, sliping on the foreign door and presentation with the payment of the throats seems inevitably less strange than "Welcome in the neighborhood, something I've reaped you, now laugh as I'm gonna ask for personal questions."
It's a good way to find friends.
Your partners will feel aware of talking to you, and maybe everything will end so that your face will add to a deep surprise.
Of course, it's the subject that you're a decent pearl.
Bad condensed cuts of muck, sugar and tumor will probably prevent the ends of sleeping when you're trying to shoot them at the door.
She eat is on students' courses with a running crime.
The steel of the whole cow is, of course, a crime, but is the cow of milk in your tea clothes?
Twice check it with the owner of milk.
There's a chance that the milk will offer you, even if they're inside.
Someone's gonna steal you something, it's angry and you have my sympathy - but you try to make a little more adult with that than my companions who have changed their milk for a feet on the mixture of the middle of the mistake, so that the evil may be destroyed.
He's in service now.
You shouldn't do sounds that break people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also public people in the wooden houses.
The girl from my neighbors asked her neighborhood if they could get a little tired and bass because they were three nights and had a letter.
Their answer was the strengthening of music.
When they finally fled in five hours, she left them quietly sleeping two hours and then left her own music, shut the door and went to her three-hour letter.
It wouldn't be romantic if your future would walk to the same trip as you?
Yet, wouldn't it be cruel if you'd put your partners on your future, sleep together, go and have to see each day, and maybe you'd take control of your common friends?
Of course, you don't manage your hearts - but if your partner's sex is not gradually your future although, at least try to talk to your weaknesses.
In a remarkable moment when you realize that someone left the keys in his unlocked room, it's just a tiny border between leather and chicken.
It's good, but it's easily.
Learn them a precious and funny lesson about their security by hiding something to them - never destroy any room with the teeth and the champion.
Close the door to them and give them the keys into the ship with water that you then slip into the wheel -- but never let their things be on the street more than two times.
Eve enjoyed the doubles, even because of the incredible views of the future.
Eva has experienced a cruel moment in pregnancy with the seven - year - old Witness today.
His father went with her and was alone for preparation and training.
I was compared to a constantly- - I was very pleased with the child and looked for a positive.
It's not true and I'm alone with my child, I'm not trying to hurt.
And I was sure that we would not stay alone, he takes Eva to her first pregnancy today.
She already met on the Internet at the chat of the elder Vaska, who began to talk about favorite films.
Your Eve and Vietnam even brought home from the birthday, but she didn't have too much in the role of an unfair daddy.
"In the time he left up from the program," described Eva in the documentary series of four in that 3.
The motive of the third series of the Czech TV is just looking for happiness for the second trial.
As regards the Viet and the financial security of the family, worked partly and big help of the mother and the teth's tea.
Even views of responsibility for the foreign child, finally, did not show Vasca's dedication to Eve.
Finally, they were given inheritance around the Witch's other birthdays and this now understands Vaska as their father and also celebrates him.
Although you already have two adult daughters, the fathership in sixty is enjoyed by your words, and the children are more.
Besides the Witness came to them two-year Leontine and finally two-year-old.
"The crowd in our family has been so naturally, maybe even because my mother has never spoken much to me in relations," she thinks smiles Eve.
A few places?
At least we're near.
Ema and Ela were born by the Caesarian river after Eve was in the end of pregnancy.
This is the deterioration of the production and activity of yellow acids, which, then, in excessive quantities, are weak in blood and are manifested in particular by witnessing.
The disease is dangerous for the unfruitful fruit that threatens the preliminary birth and death, in the mother’s birth itself will take away.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evina and Vasca, even though they were just in the 36th week.
Emergency placed in the incubator in a intermediate division where Vaskov netherer works, which came to overtake and stay.
Elinka was greater and immediately after I had to be transported from JIP to room, she describes a detailed period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the family until the doctors were invited to leave a minute that could reach the border of two kilos.
Waiting for children in the family of Eve’s joy, but it did not.
"I was a foolish stuff for my husband and children," she took up a hard châây at the sixth division of a fourth mother.
She also considered a reverse signature with her husband, otherwise because of an inevitable access to one of the doctors.
But, finally, the doctors left Eve and the two in the home care.
The events of four pregnancy and births sent TT1 in the dinner dinner at 21:45 hours.
The whole majority of the family is able to make it possible.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eve had to get up with a electro-duplicate and severe submine.
Although the house hasn't increased, you have made Eve the joy by installing a gas chain to be prepared to eat for six persons more convenient.
If it's the most heavy, we'll take care of the taxi.
Eve is convinced that children take care of family events and a pleasant atmosphere, not of size or deterioration of the house.
In the meantime, we got too nice, better than we waited.
Although the disagreement is worse hiding in the small space, and we sometimes crossing the kidnapping, but at least we are all near, Eva smiles, which will be able to find a position of the page.
Your work of lighting in the movie is not the assurance of a regular income.
That's why it's sometimes going out to the streets of praise as a taximan.
In his sixty years, according to his words, the financial care of the family and the children of physically controls how it will be?
"I realize that, in view of our difference, I will be one time, who will live this family," Eve admits at the point of questioning the future.
She'd like to return to the job, but it's still more likely to hide her own business.
With four kids, I'm not just a tree for employees.
And when it's the worst, we'll get a taxi with our husband. He's a sympathic blonde.
Apple put his effect.
For everything they can display.
Increasing processer, a camera with a higher solution, a stronger chase or a display of recognising the strength of touching, these are in the shorter of recently presented iPhons of the nine generation.
The last two have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhons 6s and 6s Plus.
The experienced Applu trend was that every new generation of iPhonu is easier than the previous.
Only the third and the fourth generation of which the weight of the previous iPhons was quite increasing.
The two-gram division of the news was at the same time insufficient.
However, this is not far paid for new iPhons.
In contrast to the low iPhon 6 and 6 Plus the same weight increased in the 14-gram model, and the more than 20 grams.
On one side, it can't be surprised, the lower affair in the Apple capsules was greatly deceived.
The news chase is so far from the 7000 higher cycle, which also was weighted.
But a lot more powerful effect on her has a display.
Apple also used 3D Touch in the newspaper, using the display of the power of touch.
It was necessary to monitor further levels of capability sensors.
The weight of displays of new iPhons in the past generations has increased more than double.
In a smaller iPhonu of p'ep 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of 19 to 40 grams.
The iPhonu 6s is so difficult to display the most useful component.
The weight of only 143 grams has then been achieved in this news, and thanks to the deduction of the skin, which touched the size of the remaining components.
The highest model is then the most difficult element of the battery used, but its weight has never changed.
Even in this case, the biggest growth is clearly at the screen.
The weight 5.5" iPhonu 6s Plus is 192 grams.
As the new display will be practical, it will be shown until the use.
The people will be able to test it on Friday 25 September when the sale of iPhons 6s and 6s Plus will be started in the selected countries.
Are the bottles of champion's feet for ten thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Pagli, archaeologists have found that opens interesting opportunities.
They discovered the tracks of seating by a modern man from different times, including seeds, and the rest of tools, and so far, and so similar.
In the level 23A, which has been given in accordance with the tools for a period of 30 thousand years ago, but they have discovered something that is very important for the rest of the dinner buffet.
Instead, there were rates of ovens, which, in view of the process of production, appeared to be processed today.
It's the first thing that she's doing today, then she's sucking, saved the pack, it's the pull, then she's spraying and spraying the rock.
In the Pagli sticks, it was able to discover the zear that was embraced or spawned according to all, and then, obviously dissolved between two molecular rocks - at least this convinces the feet of use on two rocks in the stick.
Therefore, scientists could not conclude in their PNAS magazine that the full process of the production of the wheel would be performed in the wheel, but the likeness is very fair.
We don't have any evidence of how people could eat, but thinking that it was with a fucking fluctuation and a pretty heavy, of course it offers completely logic.
It is also a very interesting evidence of how intensely humans used plants for a long time before landing.
It is the same interpretation that the oldest bottles have predicted agriculture for 20 thousand years.
New report of stations in the City Brn Leader Company.
So I listened again to the name of the troleabus: Hâkkava, Pruzrak, Fraz, Spratecka.
Of course, the trolleibus was somewhat more sounder, so the reporting to a man's voice was somewhat less comprehensible than before when the delays were reported with a woman's voice.
Women's voice is higher, so in the deepest sound of transport movement is better recognizable than the deepest man's voice.
Although DPMB arguments that this voter has chosen travelers themselves - I don't know who, though, did not ask me anybody, but they have chosen this from the studio records set out in the full silence, which, of course, had been very different than in the bus engine.
I have lived in Brň for a few beautiful decades, so the right names of all these intentions I can remember, so I don't do this report, but foreigners who don't recognize in the Birne, and for which these reports are particularly designed, may be killed and can be finally reported at the end of where they came, but to say that the delay that they had to go out was not totally reported.
Maybe the choice of a voter - but better the voters - make it again, and this time the colored with a running vehicle sound and the engine's rock, in which the player's cup in the bus is just losing.
And they didn't have to keep listening to the names of the Water Herschpice, Smirova, or then Ponorna in the rocking village where I stopped in Komaru.
I guess my old listener didn't hurt so much once during the day when the voter changed.
Before that day, I understanded those reports very well.
Good open, Court of Chief.
From the records of the trailer.
Today, there are few people who know what the biggest and smartest of the governments were, as well as complex tests.
I've allowed me to take it.
The bus was late.
I came to the dinner office at the moment when the wedding realized that it was just seven hours.
"You're lucky that you didn't hurt the companion, came a minute before you, and it seems that it's not just a chance," noted the district, while I was recorded into the book of income.
Well, I'll get a bitch.
You write me that I'm going after the surroundings to review detailed mechanisms.
It's not going to happen, it's a test today.
Everyone's fucking scared.
What's really going on?
"But you're gonna see," he cried out.
You're going to be the next one.
I went out to the bathroom.
Then the doors opened the headquarters, and the chief opened himself.
Beat, with stone face, in perfectly falling the same krone.
"Good thing, Mr. Chief," I welcomed honestly, and he locked two sack buttons of the same.
"Good," she replied, and I've gone into the second patrol, unless I realized the cool, cruel tone to which the old man answered.
"You're playing," she welcomed me, Eve's engineer, the older lady I've appreciated very much.
She even was the leader before the companions met her.
They're tests, and you'll get a taxi.
I asked a few times what these complex tests are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
It seems to be one time in three years, all of them must be, and it's pretty inappropriate.
At least for some.
I'll see it.
I went out of the puzzle fascicle with periodic reports and the phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me right now," the chief voice answered.
What's wrong?
Now we've met and nothing..." I've murmured, but no one answered me, everyone just with his thoughts.
"Good day, companion of the chief, I came to your order," I was deceived, I went into the headquarters.
The chief was sitting behind the board and watching the box.
"The Cousin of Mechanism," he said after a minute, without lifting up his head and still looking carefully on it, "Your behavior doesn't like me."
He dropped the lift on the table, thrown into the board, and stuck up on me with a dressing, inappropriate, bad, pickle view.
I'm disappointed.
What's going on?
I was glad that I worked very well in those few months in the provinces, and he was happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he dropped me out of the hall on the remote.
What about this now?
Make sure you're a trace distant technic, and you've got to keep it.
The good news you used today is simply unacceptable.
I loved that I used such a salutation from childhood, that I was so grown up and that I didn't see anything wrong on him.
The chief was like a red hair on the crocane.
"You're on the socialist railway and the only acceptable salutation is the honour of the work," he bought a conscious chief.
Moreover, you're still playing the celebration of the overseers.
One time you're gonna say "lady" and "master" again.
But I'm not a chief for you, but a judge.
The residents are the judges of the residents, the top travellers are the judges of the top travellers!
Remember that!
Excuse me, sir, the coach of the chief, but... I welcomed you with a running civil salute.
But there's nothing wrong... and it's the honour of work, or a companion... you know ... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your privilege that you're not on the side," the brilliant broke the chief who's a little calm in the middle of the time.
But it's gonna be talking about it.
Remember everyone that you don't have a place in the income.
It wasn't good.
When the leader said to someone that something was not his advantage, it didn't look good with the person concerned.
I had a little bit of a stuck, pickle view, and I was looking for the words I would answer.
I was also worried about his increased shot.
He was just a few years older and played on the Lord, actually a judge god.
Wood, foolish, autoritative, arrogant how it happened at the moment.
He's all.
Come on, he's a chief.
In fact, not all of them, the President of the partnership organized him as all sides, but also the non-sideds.
But the leader was running to many, especially those who could apply his supernaturality.
He's just shot me for the full cow.
I thought something about the fuck, and it's been too much to help me not shoot it into his kiss.
But I wouldn't go back to the crowd, so I'd continue to do a travel officer.
What would I enjoy two kids?
And that's a disgusting bar!
I've been crazy, but I've controlled myself.
I won't make him this joy.
"It's all, you can go," the audience ended the chief and started again fully watching the layer that he had before in his hand.
They've been calling me at half twelve.
All of the offices were already there, and they asked what and how, they answered that it would be good.
Only Jodžin's cousin was his habit that they couldn't get us all out of here because the work had to make the judge of the head himself with his own ancestors, and that it would not be threatened.
The word "sudruh" thus highlighted, as if he imagined what the old man shot for me.
The mainly was a nice collection.
Judge the chief behind his written table and at the long advisory table, other companions who had to decide about my official apartment or not.
A car, President ROH, a recorder from the personal, a reporter for specials, something on the way of combating the war, and the officer, my boss.
And the most important person, the President of the Partnership Organization.
I knew him out of the shot.
A normal trace worker, he was able to spend a beach or a looking bowl.
But also an ex-beacher.
It was heard that that time there was no shit with him, like a beautiful beast.
The bad languages claimed that the school went out in the seventh class, I didn't learn anything, he didn't know anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended at the cover.
But the judgment, yes, the court was cut!
The chief commanded me to sit down.
She was a little bitch in me, an inappropriate weakness in my cup.
The carrier has read a sentence from the Civil Committee from the residence.
I'm coming from the work family, I'm married, two kids and so far and so far.
It's good yet, I thought, and I got a little better spirit.
Then a trial from the street organization of the party.
He copied the case from the civil committee, maybe both wrote the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of the members of the Party, refused to be delivered before the examination committee and followed by the parties, in particular from health care.
The chief looked at me.
The boy observed it and stopped reading.
The chief commanded to continue.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the City Committee of SSM, and there I was obtained for the candidate of the party.
Notwithstanding parents who went out from the side, the party gave me confidence.
But I married, and I had a wedding outside the National Committee, too.
I've been disappointed by the worst way of trust in the party.
That's why I was thrown out of the number of her candidates.
But it disappeared!
I left both kids get baptized, and even Mom, when she died, I made the church a funeral, although it was an ancient member of the party.
All of this I give a negative position to the leader role of the party.
When the cow was reading, only the ticking of the heads of the tickets in the table stopped the pressed silence.
Everyone looked up to me, and I wanted to be a lot far.
Then I continued to say, "Comunists - superlide, communists - overlide." What did I do?
Why didn't I ray stay at the bathroom?
I could correct the outputs, even without a shared tests.
But now?
The carrier of the travel officer took her before she started.
Return to the chat?
It's not going to go. The leader's gonna make me out for a hour.
"Cousin, how did you check the judge here?" He cancelled the silent chief with the question of the coach.
Well, according to a trial from the previous job.
Do you have him here?
It wasn't obviously too many times.
On the road, he was nervous, as if he was tested.
He hurtfully touched and gave a paper to the headman.
"Yeah," said the chief with the sign of the magic, which often was the prejudice of the rain.
For the first view, the same praise, learned by the designation, studied the industrial, worked in the workshop as a coach, was in the meaning of a hundred and twenty percent.
It's just a basic degree.
From where did you take the trial, my companion?" He returned to a cadraw who felt that it would begin to turn against him and that he couldn't have been very soon or shouldn't be a cadraw.
Here's the judge who gave it to me, at the time of the trip.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the cow into the coat," the cockpit blew.
And there's no trial. He's been any more, so I put him into the folder.
"So when you put this chart in the technology, you've got this chart of the paper," sucked the chief.
The cartridge was nervous and no one had a response.
"It doesn't matter, we're negotiating," he concluded the business of the chief, and the coachs were obviously excited.
I'm going to get it.
"What about you, companion?" The chief returned to me again.
It's once to me, so that's the end!
I was dark in my eyes, I was hot.
He followed the accusation and accusation, and I felt that I was the most contrary creature in the world that doesn't deserve self-being.
That in the middle of an incomplete test, I put it in the middle of the coach of the coach, and I didn't understand why the trial was incomplete when I got it from the coach in the manufacture.
I am also an anti-socialistic life that supports religious darkness races during the creation of real socialism, ba, even with them.
That it was what I had burned, or maybe I'm still sleeping, and I prayed quietly to finish it.
I was all one.
I was one to fly out of the mechanizer's place.
I was the one that I was going to take the crap.
This is a job for honest and obedient people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the leader.
"That would be enough, companion of the chief," the president of the party immediately answered and rejected the leaders of the Levites.
Here the court made a mistake, a terrible error.
What a mistake, he did just foolish!
But he's already getting his sin!
Don't worry about it, Court of Justice!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side for time!
To open it again, he'll have to prove that he has changed that it's our trust again.
An unfair bachar spoke as a book.
Where did that go in?
Is he so counted or papered the phrases from the schools and meetings?
Therefore, this young judge must also have a chance from us!
The chance to prove that he has changed.
And who's going to give it to him, if not just you, Court of Chief?
It's your obligation to support this young man, truly, somewhat a deceived companion, to support his efforts to rectify!
It's your page obligation that no one will deliver you!
In fact, it's a side obligation to all of us.
The court must see that the one has not forgotten his side.
That as a lovely mother, she is not just a criminal, but also loved.
When the president ended, no one heard it.
No one expected such a turnover.
At least me.
"I'm totally agreeing with you, companion of the President," the leader's ironly attempted to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me agree, you'd hear that I'd just look forward to such a conclusion.
Everyone was stuck with his heads, but it was on them to see that he didn't believe him or his word.
"So I was confirmed for the self-related reporter's care about the basic cup," I locked me back to the office, and backwards I dismissed.
Besides Eve's engineers were all at the dinner.
The silver listened to my unexpected number of fresh defects, and I was calm in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I could get a coffee.
Without waiting for a response, she put water on the wheel and cut the wheel.
In the meantime, she talked about coadrovac practices.
As one trial, often full of praise, they give the man into their hands, and the other where there is a cup, they send to the new employer.
But I didn't finish where I had, but on the fourth side of the crowd, so the companions of the fabric didn't know where to send it.
What about our cowboy?
He's old, where he's gonna eat or drink, and then it's finally done what happened.
"There's from the old shit," she's noticed crimely.
I'm sure he's gonna get to him today.
Take care of him, he's quite funny.
What about the partner president?
In principle, the worst leader, no human being.
Zero from a crowd with great power.
The water on the coffee started to swallow and the Office was filled with the coffee just a salted coffee.
I dropped into the cocktail of sugar and the milk mixed a bitter leather.
I hope I'm out of the worst outside.
Now I'm not out of the way, and other tests are three years old.
Everyone, the judge will not forget me this day.
Anthology of LITERATI IN TRAIT II. in EPIKA
The symbol of the foreign was alive.
It's about a crowd over Chlum, and it's going back after years.
It's looking far away because it's located at 15 meters high stone.
People in the wide range call him a wind on Chlum.
For the property of 150 inhabitants, even one of the elements of the general sign that had been obtained to the possibility of the parental confusion in 2010.
"We asked for a sign then, and we wanted to have a sign, of course, knowing him around everyone," said the elder Jiří Mashek.
Clumic cow is a local technic memory.
It's so little as the mement of modernity: at the same time when people now fought about the quality of drinking water.
This in Chlum in the past centuries was a frequency.
By 1910, the Colombian representatives decided to resolve, which then had been made up to the half of the eighty years.
In the neighborhood of Chichov's departments, they allowed a seven meters of deep foot.
Three years later, the football was added to the cow with a swimming hole that was thrown into the reserve at the highest point of the foreign, near the coast.
"Antonin Kunc has performed an Antoine Kunc from Granic to Morava with a cost of 2,400 corn," says the memory signature on the landscape of the holder.
Some of the works and the falls of the road served in 1971.
On 7 May 1973, it began to write new water fighting: that day in Chlum began to serve a new water.
The wind wheel has already remained only a non-general symbol and a rarit.
Dominant was carried out in the aeroplane of parents.
By 2008, Chlumski decided that the round would be replaced and bring it back into the way.
They let the p's replicate of the hill reduced by a half meter.
Along with the stone, however, it had to be moved down the same year.
The replica manufacturer did not allow the appropriate material and the round was not supposed to disturb the injuries.
Then the cloud dominant was spending a few years under the shore.
However, from the aerodrome of June, the round on the high stage is again.
At the occasion of the confusion of the parents, she left the road replica and replaced it on the top of the railway.
But around the red is a useful water from the fountain just to a cross-blind brain.
And in the year, we've completely disconnected him because there was a little water in the bottle.
It was at least empty.
"Therefore, on the top of the wheel's wheel from the wheel in the cockpit, we'll reconnect again," explained the mask mask.
Chlum is not the only community in Czechland, where the round has been reached in the general character, but is the only part of this type in the whole Highness.
Similar element in the character has the honor of local technical memories, for example, in Cvalkoviën and Green Mountains in Bishop, in Kugel in Hodoninsk, Partuavia in Transovalska or in the Police in Vsetinsk.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafat, admitted Tripolis Goian opposition.
"Appeal against Slovenia I remember very well, and my →, as all in my career," the 34-year Goian dreamed on the pre-case printing.
That time, George Hagi trained us, it was worth we lost.
I hope I'm gonna give Sparty now.
Only with the difference that we don't lose this time," Goian continued.
Just this guy, who expressed 60 reactions for Romanian representation, is the key opposition of the Greek team.
As a stepper, he's going to take back to Spanish officials.
There will come thousands of people, no peculiar, talking about the Greek Society of Hybsch.
And partly thinks what he can wait on Thursday evening.
I know Fataie, who played in the Roman Aster with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their backs.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta too, said Goian.
Other Balalists of the Prague Club did not mention, so the direct question was whether she knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with easy calculating view, he measured the Czech journalist.
"Why do you ask me about it?"
He was quiet for a minute.
We saw a video and I noticed Sparta plays a lot of team.
He's got a good player.
And Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone other than Fataie.
It's very well about Goiano.
"My experience from the most experienced clubs, it is to say that it holds a defense of Asteras, it's their organizer of games," a Spanish assistant Stanislav Haykal warned.
Goian has the best years behind him, but he can be encouraging with a very interesting balancing life.
At its time, Burussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both manchester generals of the United and City, but moved to the Italian Palerma, playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggression and an unusual, says the trainer.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European coaches, pere on winning in Czech Lisa.
It's a favorite for me in this department, but we're playing home and we want to start a group with a good outcome.
Like Sparta, we'll try to win, he brought Goian.
I'm in the room with the Slovenian Officer Tomas Kossian, who's very happy in the contemporary of Czechland.
I too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight strongly.
Kofola moves from Poland to Czechland, considers the entrance of the puzzle.
The new seat should have Kofol in the island.
Cool S.A. was registered in Poland from the trade of the company in the Varsovian bourgeois.
Our primary goal is to have a group's seat in the Czech Republic.
The steps that we have undertaken in the project are very legal and administrative and have no real impact on actions in the company, says Daniel Burish, the financial director of the Kofol group.
"In relation to the movement of seats of the group of actors, they consider the location of action on the puzzle.
For the income to Burza, Praha has completed the prospect of a valuable paper, which will present at the nearest time of the Czech Nationality to approve.
The movement of holding seats and related transfers of action will be successful in the form of non-governmental transactions by participating in it only existing actors.
Therefore, in the exercise of this operation, no action will be offered to register the public or new investors.
"The proposal for action to new investors would succeed - if the company and its shareholders will decide - it will, either on 4 February 2015 or on 1 February 2016," said the company.
In the past, the company has already stated that the eventual offer of action could be consistent of new actions or sales of existing actions.
This offer could be made from the proposal for action in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the location of action and the Varsovian Burge.
Testing the objectivity of the Czech TV in information on migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and the reporting of the main Czech media on uprchlic crisis.
This time, sending the Chair reporting session of the Czech TV.
How'd she stay?
When journalists learn about how media can manipulate reality, they can leave today the Czech TV.
Migrant crisis was approximately 80% of reporting.
On the first minute, when the CAT reported about the inquiry in Serbia and Hungary border and the attacks of migrants on the police called Euphemisticks to them patience - they cut stones and attacked the rocks, it was now a migration propaganda - see the names of individual reporters.
The criticism of non-governmental organizations is a large space for non-requisite organizations that criticize wrong construction.
Syrian children in the Czech School - the history of the integrated Syrians in CR.
It's not just like a threat, but also a chance.
Traveling refugees - CHT uses the terms of a running or a refuge and not a migrant.
Increasingly, it is that the CT in the illustration boxes uses only and only boxes for small children and women.
In the same sentence, she concluded that the migrants held in Czech are 80% of men.
Summary: The largest part of the propaganda, which does not have a period of communists.
I have to say I'm going to be like a former journalist for colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I ever got to the panel apartment, soon I stopped to be the only people.
My fishers were moved to the square town.
Fisheries homes, wheat with a change of non-perfect, that is, which doesn't produce that translation from the households to the bridge and the youth looks like a adult unit, just a small and gradually growth.
They were oppressive, and I didn't lose them.
First in hand and after chemicals.
Socialist drugs on their liquidation offered some blue cristals.
I think it was Cyklon B.
Or else?
However, it was successful.
I've done it with Pharaoh like that.
A box with a juvenalizer, which the marvelers brought into the nest, and then he did not allow the king to generate a new semen.
But I rejected it.
As the time came, it was a mixed object of my wonder, and yet more I've been joined to think that he has the same right to life as we people.
Moreover, I have taken from my life experience that the input into the ecosystem doesn't lead to success, and one can replace one another.
I wouldn't like to get the truth in the bullets and the bottles to hurt my carm by killing them.
In the new apartment, we agreed with the partner that if we have a fisherman for a crock, let them eat quietly the bullets of the falling wheat, even those invisible rows and similarly.
Their quiet existence has been cut off the bullet after time.
It was a running species of a cockpit who was at times sitting on the street.
We had to live from sometimes men and friends, which just increased comfort.
Because he lived for a few years with us, we found that he was primarily fishing and that their group was obviously maintained in a crucial state of counterfeit.
The trusted regular contact at every need we have proved that it was a single one.
We were witnesses of romantic conferences with a partner about some third of the less, as he carefully hangs on the flames, so that he would not be burned before the exhausted copulation reaches.
It was about three days when they didn't move and did not respond to our controls.
Under the west moon, where gracious games were played, we found the rest of the wounded shot near the same side.
Then the powder wasn't missing for a long week.
When we thought it had been behind it, we were surprised by a number of small pools, higher differences in her area.
They disappeared soon.
Part of them were burned by Mom, and they were disappointed by others.
Even the socket has disappeared somewhere after a week.
If she's gone or sleeping, we don't know, but after a month, two, she's opened again on the street.
True, something less, probably the daughter of the shipbuilder.
Sometimes from the street, she watched carefully our behavior and moved under the West Mouse to evaluate our injury as a friendship.
The initial status of some designed fisheries again was decreased and the powder was quietly seen his running activities to ensure food.
The whole year our eco wasn't changed.
Our daughter has grown up to the time the night's use was a disappointment.
Soon we've tolerated it, but we've already been asking about the relief of his range.
We invited her to use the bathroom.
Yet, her daughter found a excuse in the bathroom that she was very well seen when she was kidding.
Our stories about that she didn't have happiness in the house.
I'm crying, and wearing, she's kidding her nightmare.
It wasn't enough.
There was a moment when a powder, in the interest of a daughter's development movement, had to be commanded.
It left me.
He was rejected into the woods and embraced through the Ballon somewhere in the garden.
I was talking about him as a friend, but I felt so long age as if I was getting out of my family.
We assumed that fishing will be more frequent and they will begin to multiply with a geometric range.
You know, a week, two, there's no one revealed to us.
I started speculating about the cause.
I felt that the bowl was there, after the pattern of the morvings, didn't know that the west of the west wasn't so favorably for their existence as we thought.
But then the first cups of the middle size appeared, and they were rehearted.
I had to imagine another theory about their disappearance, and I came to see that their liaison on a powder had to have a reason to see him hidden at any other place and that they would be dangerous in anywhere.
Or, they may have had any telepathy connections with their predator and his equivalent disappearance in them have been called by an appealing reaction.
Besides, I'm not doing any illusion about their air.
They showed some flashing light, but they would respond to holding hands or moves, not.
The daughter's going to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot the night.
It's just going to join a rebound.
I'm sending my desire to the eter, and I hope they've not taken me after the execution.
Otherwise, they had to use the cyclon B.
The decade of Albert Einstein's statement, which has rejoiced in the world.
The genius of the past centuries, obviously, will never stop fascinating mankind.
He was able to be so deeply deceived that the outbreak was a significant discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important members of all the time.
In the responsibilities of people, he has introduced its special and general theory of relativeity, which then best describes the universe in its gigantic situation.
It can also not be mentioned by its exposure to the photoeffect or the concept of electrical electromagnetic field quantification.
There is no doubt that the same description and the system of recognition of the annual relativeity theory is so interested for many that for closer notification of raâi, it is easy to choose examples.
But it's not easy.
Of course, it would not be Albert Einstein, if even on this he found a geniusly simplified form of explaining: The hour near your loving one seems to look for a minute; a minute in a hour in the hour seems to be - and it is relative.
I allowed me to choose the ten of his famous citizens from all his famous pools, which have been captured by me.
Intelligent people are trying to resolve problems, genial trying to do it.
Only two things are unnecessary.
Wisdom and human depth.
I wasn't so bad at the first one.
No number of trials can never prove that I had the right.
However, the only one can ever prove that I was wrong.
But it's a mild period when it's easier to break atomic than to destroy prejudices.
If an accident on the table is a disorder in the mind, what will the empty table then reflect?
I don't know who's going to fight in the Third World War, but in the fourth, it'll be clocks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing is a little dangerous and to do much too.
If I had an hour for the problem that my life depends on, I would have 40 minutes on his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and 5 minutes with his solution.
The most difficult thing in the world to understand the tax of the income.
Finally, I can't forsake Einstein's formula for the definition of success: If we take A for success, it applies the pattern: A=X+Y+Z where X is work, Y rest, and Z is to keep the language for teeth.
New and modern.
The hospitals in the Zilly country expect changes to 1.5 billion.
"It's success when we consider that this year all four are holding in black numbers," he replied pleasantly the leader Stanislav Mishak.
The total winning of national equipment is about 32 million crowns at this time.
The share in this holds mainly higher refunds than the insurance, which are equally beneficial for the year.
The fact also shows that after poor years, sickness can finally allow more investment.
In Croatia, Vsentina, Uheran Hradišti and Zlina, it is the result of buildings that are about 1,5 billion crowns.
The long time we bought the main devices ended.
Now we have to start building a new building, because without them there is no medical health to do, the national health plans for Lubomir Nevertime have been planned.
It's glad for changes in all diseases.
The facilities will come to the hospital next year.
In Vestine, they now choose a new internal pavilion suppliers for about 300 million crowns.
In Croatia, there is a planned dialysis.
Uheran Hradische wants to build a new internal for 200 million for the year opened to the central pavilion.
And the illness of Bathi’s hospital waits for a new central income and internal building that will need three quarter billion.
In all cases, it is the main and often the major changes in the last years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors is an extremely important step," she declared for example to build a entertainmental internal Manager of the illness of Vera Prousk.
Five-patrol buildings must be ready for two years and offer comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and unit care.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that mostly are known by patients will be touched by all regions.
The new buildings will, for example, replace those in which many sick in one room, on the watch of only one toilet, beds are incompatible, unfortunate windows, and healthy people have no relevant subminans for work.
"For example, our internal was built for fifty years ago and now it is at the border of his life," showed the leader of the evil disease of Paul Calábek.
In some years, it will be replaced by the seven-level modern building associated with urgent receipt.
Doctors and patients will have all acute divisions in one place, including in the new rooms.
The same model is already in the half of the Uher Hradische.
The central income is already standing, and it's going to get to it within three years.
"We'll pay the building from the credit and part of the own ships," explained the director Peter Sladek.
Just this disease can allow its own financing as only in the country.
The win is still the highest and the loss has been missing two years ago when a lying hospital has been killed with at least two million losses.
"We have a good relationship with assurances, excellent performance, income and effectively conduct the costs in the whole hospital," Vlastimil Vajdak, who has an economic care.
Enhancements are also expected by patients in the chronic disease.
During ten to fifty years, new devices and restructuring will go to half billion crowns.
There will be a famous station ready for years, and then the dialysis will begin, if possible, building a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained me how I should keep the land-friends accepted if they don't want to live in Czech.
The Minister Milan Chovanec (CSSD) is inside, after negotiating with its European colleagues, claims that the remaining States of Czechland press to accept the quota for the re-distribution of appeal, but any discussion refuses.
It also points out that no one has explained to him how to maintain the assigned springs in Czech when they do not want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec said to the journalists.
Can you describe the position you've come to the Deputy Ministers' negotiations inside and invoke the European Union?
We do not agree with obligation quotas as a system that can't work.
We can't talk about the birds of salt or smoke.
It's a living habitat that has a vision, where they're going, having a family.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we are able to maintain Member States' territory if they were re-distributed.
We can't imagine that.
We did not get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With the final conclusions - the harmful, so registered places, the protection of borders, the camps outside Europe, the confidence fund for African countries and other things, we do not have any problem with it.
We've been talking about this for a year and we've said this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
Recently, we've solved forty thousand, now it's hundred twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do these people keep on the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of people who cross through us want to go to Germany.
No one wants to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have ambitions to walk with other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamites and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, get to us asiles, but the interests of people from this pool, so from Syria and other countries is limitedly close to zero.
You mentioned that we're not going to want to go, but 15 hundred people we've already been committed to accept.
Wouldn't it be possible for them to take this way more?
We have committed us to accept 1500 people, but with a submin.
We said, "Casts, border protection, military operations."
And in those 1500, it's about 1100 people with whom we are putting the asylum procedure.
They're coming to our team, and we're going to be with them as well as with those we got.
It is a great question, and we will discuss this with Europe if we can keep people registered in Italy and Greece, where appropriate, in Hungary.
Because Europe does not have a record, if they have a registration, they can't be arrested.
This means, they will come to our registering territory, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, we can not even keep on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany after they arrive.
We'll be able to keep them after the azyl process, and we'll arrange azyl procedure with them.
If the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, so 98 per cent, according to Europeans, will receive international protection.
Then they will get evidence that will allow them to travel to Europe.
And I think these people will end again in target countries.
Then there's four hundred people who're going to move.
It's the second project that has been developing, and we've only continued there to discuss with the churches about the possibility that they could help them get employment, housing and so further.
But that's the run on a lot of trace.
You said that the final states were not willing to discuss for the negotiations of the Ministers with us.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic only refuses the quota, but doesn't it offer any solidarity step that would dislock the debate?
And what exactly must be a solidarity step?
The Social Republic of Germany will invite all Syrians to join them, so the report will be spread in a number of hours after all camps after Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's going to make another spring wheel that moves to Germany because they just don't want to us.
We believe that the road is protected from the external borders - just to deal with the eggs, to help those needed, and to separate the economic holdings.
I mean, give them evidence that they don't have any chances.
Only in Germany in a nearly year, fifty thousand of Kosovo.
From the safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representatives.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to economic needs, the 50 percent of what social systems today deal falsely with them would be able to go to the springs.
Over the first day when Germany carried out controls, the numbers held in Czech shot.
Now it's 18, the first day was twelve.
Where do you want to get the controls on the halls yet?
We've been afraid of an impression in a hundred people.
These are the numbers we can do.
We still have a few hundred free places in stone detention equipment.
Of course, all the people we're holding will be back to the Russian seven days.
We're doing it standardly.
There are only those who take us, with Hungary it's complicated, and Greek -- that's a completely unfortunate story.
So where's the point of evil?
Is it supposed to be a thousand people daily?
I think it's supposed to be a few hundred days ago.
Two hundred, three hundred people per day, three days after them, we have so much abilities that they're putting down the crisis plans.
Then I agreed with Mr. Prime Minister that he would call an extraordinary government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're on telephone contact some times daily.
If this would happen, the Government could set the de fact immediately and a single resolution would decide to strengthen the military police, let's take the customs governance, where appropriate, for the annual service.
Is the country-variant an exceptional status that now has been reported in some places in Hungary?
I think it can't get to us so far.
Make sure that our position is different, we are a national state in Europe, a Kengense border we have only, and only aircraft.
I don't know what to happen to this in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to broadcast a free information.
All information we have from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, are further convinced that the Hungarians will try to remove the course to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean the direct road to Russia.
The Czech Republic would have touched it very increasingly, at all.
Slavia paid a lot of debt for the last minute.
It's trying to prevent the statement of an accident.
Football Slavia paid the debt.
The money was also expected by the Ballists.
Fotbal Slavia first placed in a department due to the inconvenient proceedings before the court.
Nearly three months after that, about 20 million crowns were given to the company Online Services from the Pacific Samoa.
Representative Slavie Zuzana Youngk attempted Judge Michael Wenzl during a few hours to convince that he does not have an accident over Slovenia.
And you need to say that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the new owner of Slovenia became a major Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC and also the CEFC billion of Jiří Shimana.
Obviously from the new owners to the club, money reached for the last minute.
This also proves the exhibition of Slovenia before the arrest of the courts - the top club on Monday, just a day before the court's negotiation, sent a debt of millions of coroners.
"All was arrested between September 11 and the 15th September," said Legal Representative Slavie Youdk.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specificly, for example, the Slovenian Extreme of Milan Ivano or the Czech bookmarker Mariu Ličko.
Slavia also arrested the payment to the agent Alexander Losenicke.
On Friday, the club also paid debt payments of the city part of Praha 10.
The part of the incompetence is so remaining in the facto only of the searches that Slovenia is addressing.
Or, according to the club, the commitment has not been dismissed, or the courts have been committed to them.
However, we are ready to pay the amounts in the case of the loss of these frauds.
"We need the banks, which we can put with the expression of the statement," she reported to the Court of Justice of the Youth Avocate.
"All that was after payment is arrested," she declared the Youth and added that they are only unreplaced or dismissed.
Of course, in the nearest days, the judgment will not be decided and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send the detailed evidence that she paid the debts mentioned.
The following will be the evaluation of all evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The Court has ordered to continue negotiating on third November.
However, the decision will not be taken to this meeting, but it will be written after it.

Blanka's got to build so that she didn't miss it.
But it would be about half billion more, says a professional of the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka's got to be safe and safe, says the expert.
The Tunnel complex Blanka was possible to create that there were no two crops of land in the Prague Stromovic, the manufacturer manager of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said it in the middle of the undernight at the newspaper viewer.
But it would be like half a billion more deep.
The drivers will be opened on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was going to break more safe, but the costs grow exponential," said Butovič.
The submines in Stromvca were the same for all the time, but the country was only a few steps from the place where it started to grow more safe and more careful.
"If the measures were used about 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half billion more lovers," Butovicz said.
The Tunel Blanka has fallen three times during the building.
Two times, in 2008, there was a corner in Stromvce, in 2010 the earth fell in the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the company Metrostav Jirí Belohlava, the tunnel is very sweet, said the Euro week.
The station had 17 billion crowns in accordance with the p-project.
When we calculate the DPH, which triggered two times during the building, you have 11 billion.
When you add to this, the sales of lands and engineering activity, the value and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is no longer from those 37 to so far, he introduced the Bellow

Zisky FedExu mixed, reduced fiscal view for 2016
FedEx has reported uncomfortable results for the last quarter and significant reduction of the total profit of the lower request for cost transport and higher costs for the earthquake division.
The company also stated that it planned to have approximately 55,000 session workers throughout the purchases.
FedEx announced in this period of the latest year that it would take 50 000 seasonal jobs.
The company's shares were about 2,5 per cent in the preliminary trade 45 minutes before the average opening.
The FedEx company states that it expects $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial year that ends the next flow, which means a decrease of $20 cents of the previous advantage.
Analysers expected $10.84, according to the investigation carried out by FactSet.
The decreased view is, despite the increase of the rates in the average of 4,9 per cent, which is shown in January. 4, and the higher contributions for land transport of hard or big packages beginning in November.
The Community noted that the growth of profits in the previous year is still expected to be reduced from the cost reduction, increased income and growth in online trade.
The President of the representative and the Director-General of the company Fredith said that the company had "increased a strong effect in despite the expected economic submissions, especially in the processing and global trade."
The purchasing plans were notified on the day after the UPS Rival company concluded that it was planned to have 90 000 to 95 000 workers more, which would be the same as the last year.
In the quarter that ended in August 31, FedEx got $692 million, which is about 6% more than last year.
Actions winning $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for action, which was predicted by 12 analyses asked by Zacks Investment Research.
The charges increased by 5 percent, for $12.3 billion.
Six analyses of Zacks asked companies expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been entitled to reduce the priority of the international ship transport, which caused the income to its Expres Unit.
But boom online purchases strengthened the results of the FedEx earthen unit.
In the last fourth year, land income increased by 29 per cent, but the operational trip was basically the same because of higher prices than packaging and own assurance.
The exposure unit referred to as a higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profits increased in the cost trade for higher prices for the work of force.
In the preliminary trade about a hour before opening, FedEx shared $3.85, or $2.5 per cent, for $150.15.
They ended the decrease of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under record from 11 June.
At their unexpected meeting for the whole year, federal reserve lawmakers take this week two days at 27 steps of a long Hungarian mahagon table and will decide whether after almost ten years the time has come to increase the key rate.
On the end of the ornament of the central bank, the double-seat room will be a milk of the United States.
Map is the fact that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues will give economic interests to the people over all.
The Central Bank has two extraditions from Kongres: maximize the US employment and maintain the current prices stability.
But from the Great Reception, the representatives of the Fed believed that there was an unwritten third period: financial stability.
And this third rubber period could be the X factor in too close to the predictable decision to be notified on Thursday, whether the American economy is prepared for the launch of an unprecedented stimulation in comparison to the short-term rates at the end of 2008.
Although data shows a solid growth of economic, recent turbulence on the world financial markets, the Fed could already be cautious for adding to inconsistence by increaseing its reference rates of federal funds - and for nothing more than the only quarter of the percentage point.
"It is obvious that the work market and inflation will first be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economy of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an incidence to increase the peace, an increased injury that survived the global market already provides them enough delay to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what Fed will do, which is the cause of nervousness on financial markets.
Approximately the half of the economys recently asked by Blomberg had predicted an increase in the rate of this week.
However, the financial markets expect Fed to continue, with the key indicator only 30% chances for increase.
This would show the decrease of the action market in the case of Fed's increased taxes, only if the political political failure promises that the further increase is in independence.
In the deterioration of the industrial prospectus Dow Jones sprinkled 228.89 points, or 1.4%, at 16 599.85.
The conviction was launched by the expectation that the Fed policy will keep the rates in peace this week, says John Lonski, the main economy in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if Fed had taken the taxes now," he said.
Fed politicians would do this, "they should go to nationality in their programme declaration and keep the financial markets in their hands, so that they should not pass panics."
Other experts claimed that increasing rate would be quiet for the financial markets because it would remove the disaster from the way Fed would be.
A month ago, Fed seemed to be in a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percent point of this month, the first small step in the late reduction of monetary submissions that would confirm the force of economic survival in the United States.
Yellen said that through the yar and the beginning of the year, he expects an increase in rates in the year, even in the complaints from the liberals, that it needs more economic progress.
Although the creation of workshops in August was lost, the work market this year was a solid growth.
The measure of unemployment has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, which is less than seven years and is near the level that Fed considers full employment.
Fish benefits have shown signs of exhibition.
And although the inflation continues to be under the annual 2% target of the central bank, the Fed policy states that the main decree was a very lower price of growth.
The economy " can be equipped with higher rates and it is, in view of the presence of the work market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economies of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets worldwide began to dismiss the end of the last month after China devaluated its currency.
The industrial prospect of Dow Jones has fallen to 16% under its record value in May when investors feared that a lossing Chinese economy would fall down global growth.
Thrh was sometimes dismissed in this month and Dow now loses almost 10% of the maximum of May.
To the political factors of the Fed, unsatisfactory market adds a complex calculation when starting to increase the rates.
"Unless what happened on the financial markets, and reports on the weakness of Chinese economy in the last few weeks, it would have come to an accommodation at this meeting," said Stephen D. Ol., leader of research worker UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now it says they're waiting for at least a month to get better control over the results.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact of the United States economy, and there are no data that they could be discussed about the latest development in China," said Ol.
The health status of global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technology should not be included in their decision.
But at the time of Fed, the world's exchange authority became.
The impact of the central bank in recent years was extreme.
The summary indication of the president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that Fed could "free" their monetary expansion on the market, started crops throughout the world.
In the world where markets and economy are still closely connected, the representatives of the Feder can also follow the development of otherwise, but also consult the final central banks and experts to better read the status of global economy.
Their decision process is "more art than it," said Zachary Karabell, the leader of the global strategy for the richness-management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Banks in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has historical stories of movements on financial markets that seem independent with economic foundations."
Lacker, voting member of the establishment of the Federal Policy of the Open Market Committee, which pressed to increase the rates, quoted decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led Fed to reduce its reference rates by 0.75 percent point during the three meetings "In addition to the identifiable impacts on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
For a year, the representatives of the Fed turned these sticks.
Fed should predict the concerns of financial stability only during the large crisis, such as the market breakdown in 2008, said Adam Posen S., an ex member of the Committee on Affairs Taxes in Bank of England.
The latest wheat doesn't even approach this level, he introduced.
"You certainly don't want to be in fear of the growth of rate because the markets were exposed," Posen said, the President of the Institute for the International Economy Peterson .
The Federal Reserve System Law has two mandates and doesn't mention the financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they'd have to get on a shot.

From the rate of 150 km/h, Sněmovna refused.
In the selected ranges, the highest authorised ≤ 150 km/h may be increased by the highest allowed subminans.
In the attack, Sněmovna decided when she approached the changement of the Senate, which refused the increase of employment.
The new legislation on earth communications will now be addressed to the President.
President Miloš Zeman has already said at the end of April that the law would enable the graduation of the milestone.
In contrast, the Ministry of Transport Dan Âok (for the United Nations) was also established by the Czech Value Network yet.
The lawyer supported the senate version of the law in the attack before the lawyer.
The approved news will now be allowed in accordance with the pp-governmental rate of 90 to 110 miles per hour at the first class's first streets, especially four hours.
The Snippet first extended this option also on the wallets on which it could be carried out in the selected ranges of 150 km/h, but the Senate refused it.
Now the lawyers have joined him.
Senators agreed with the newsleading Ministers also granted the authorisation of the carrier police to have the last word in the adjustment of local communications on which foreigners are concerned.
The Senate version that Snemovna approved also calculates that the channels, waters or public lighting cabs could be stored in part under the surface of the vehicle.
Foreigners would have been so protected for the purchase of lands.
Foreigners should also not have the obligation to take care of the road vegetation to share local roads without regard to the owner of the relevant territory.
Novela must also help to improve the protection of the road and facilitate the income with the remote vehicles to which the owners do not report.
The new foreigns may sell vehicles that will not be notified within six months after the notice of their owner's retirement.
Foreigners will have the opportunity to eliminate transitional cost transport through their territory after other and third-party forces under the threat of delays and for transport companies.
The new is also to delay the possibility of introducing electronic repository notes instead of advanced papers that will be used as so after 1 January of the next year.
According to the Government, it's going to cover money for the introduction of the electronic system.
He's going before the court.
He's been threatened for the pregnant welcome of the strangers to him 10 years.
The case is related to the particularly prejudiced project Welcome to the branches.
The police wanted to stumble in this castle and lawyer Zuzana Kaila (CSSD), but she didn't do it.
According to the legal case, both are threatened to ten years of negotiation.
The call is still planned for two October days.
According to the State Representative of Mandik and Macike, at least one million crowns caused damage, which resulted from blame.
The dealer is concerned about a finding trial.
The former members of the town's leadership, according to the complaint, have unrighteously enabled to gain the property of the company that organized the welfare of foreigners.
The Mandy, according to the complaints of the director of the City Services, School and Cultural Committee, introduced to celebrate the selection of five fires.
When another company, which offered the lowest price, has cancelled the concurrence.
Then the town had to trust the administrator, and only the company of Darothore, which then was assigned to the town's advice.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both complaints are aimed at ensure that Darothore is granted a public prohibition for the arrangement of the Action Welcome to the Labtime of the Labs and co-ordinated acted at least in contrast with the request for the procurement of the public operator, writes the State Representative.
At the same time, they have been determined that Darothore, after the receipt of this prohibition, calculates the Assembly over Labem for the implementation of the Action Welcome to the Foreign Price, which will raise the real value of the services provided.
Three years ago, the company wrote over five million corners.
The city finally paid only one part, a total of 1,7 million crowns, and then departed from sây.
The payment amount was at least prejudiced to a million crowns, according to the finding assessment.
The mandick has rejected any violation of the law before.
I haven't done any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this designed cuse, he said a former recipient before, that the city under his lead was just linked to a project of the past years.
In 2008 to 2010, the Roxy II Agency assessed the event.
"It was for the same submin, for the same money," added Mandik.
The criminals also wanted to accuse Cayle, who was also a member of the city's Council.
The sender's snippet, but she didn't do it.
Criminalists, therefore, have rejected the box in her case, but count that Cayle's accusation after the missionary mandate ends.
Welcome to the branches was a Community action that had been done sometimes to the year.
Mothers with her had a 5 thousand crowns of gifts for the purchasing of children's needs and detailed gifts.
Hungarian police officers have given up to the dog's appealer.
Then the journalists accepted to delete the record.
The Hungarian police at the border with Serbia quickly arrested the cameraman of the AP agency and led him to delete the record on which the police dog was evidently struck to the land of the AP.
The Hungarian government, but this accusation doubts.
The data incident came on Saturday evening when the AP Luca Musi cameraman filmed those who passed over the sugar field near the Hungrian city of Röszke over the border with Serbia.
In contrast to the rebels, the cops went out and one of them left the true Syrian attacking a dog with a cockpit on a cockpit.
The dog who cried, "Please, please, I'm a puzzle," he cried, forced the Museum.
The Museum's filming everything, he's noticed one of the cops and didn't let him go.
Then the journalist hadn't had to phone any more to his supervised, or to his colleagues in the place.
The Music Policies brought him to dark place at the registration center and asked him to show them what he had to be repaired.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
This is how Museum took place for two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because they were close to dogs.
The AP Agency sent a protest letter to the Hungarian Government of Zoltán Kovács.
The behaviour of the police in it indicated that it was unacceptable and that journalists should have the opportunity to cover events without risking physical violence and not to fear that the government would destroy legally obtained material.
Kovács, with a revocation to the police report of the Music counterpart, doubted.
He said the police just wanted to show them the journalist if they were on some cases that they think they're right.
When they found that they weren't there, they didn't put him in.
"The dogs can shoot - they are used to fear and a little scare, but they haven't truly attacked," Kovács said.
Unpredictable Liga of Masters.
City's whirlwind will hit us, Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we've deserved to lose," he screamed Manuel Pellegrini's head, looking at the City's home.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was the classic ship of the Master Liggy.
One team didn't create a lot of opportunities, but we had the meat on the bathrooms longer.
"The cause of the damage was not in a tactic, Juventus just shot two beautiful Ây," he assessed the strength of Pellegrini, whose team was incaused in a concurrence after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the past season of Juventus was on it before the mutual concentration exactly inverse - after the first three corners of the Italian ligue has the depth of the title only point and the skin 2:4 is located on the 16th place of the table.
And therefore it was turning to Etihad Stadium with great surprise.
"This clue will help us psychicals, will hit us," will trainer Massimiliano Allegri, who must have been organized before the new year ago with the loss of three opposition - Pirla, Teveze and Vidala.
In Manchester, the Pogba, Mandjukich and Morata were arrested.
"It's right, this victory is very important, maybe we'll find it on a winning wall," Morata's hope.
Because when we're on it, we're looking forward to the best manship in Europe.
In the second half time, we were better, mainly in an attack phase.
This result is my players.
"Before our balance, we could still incase on 0:2, but Gianluigi has kept us," he appreciatively appreciated the cup of Allegri, M. Buffon.
"We made a few good chances," hated Yay Tourego, booker City.
We have to get out of Ligy's experience masters and try for a better result next.
Bye Angelo, good old German II.
Before we continue on the issues of immigrants, we should have realized that the whole median disturbance around is managed by professionals.
According to the media needs and also the seshora.
So let's stop on the ch's.
Today, newspapers and media are full of kids who take their parents on their hands on the dust of the exode.
And it calls in a man, so in a European person, automatically feeling of fault and compassion.
Well, they're not just coming here, they're not just stumbled kids, you're not taking a look at the clusters of the people to the Greek Islands that the kid's not so much to see them!
Well, the last time, we were lost from the television pictures of ships on Lampedus, refugees from the French Family of Menton, whose beautiful changes are located in thousands of young men.
From a large part of the young black.
And they also lost images from Callais, where these snows and black men are waiting for them to be made by the tunnel under La Manche.
I think he's not thinking about it anymore.
Even those images of the primitive Christian Church of Eritrea did not make a special idea to the people of Europe.
It was too bad.
So when it's about the quota for refugees, it's also hiding that it's not only about a distressing child from Syria, but also on the exhibited - for elders: nicely disappointed - young man.
Their muscles look like they're just out of the same fit center.
It's just one personal benefit.
Years ago in Turkish - Muslims - parts of Cyprus, we lied on the private beach of the hotel.
Notwithstanding that she was private, a large group of cars came to the beach immediately.
But no shit.
And the younger black came out of them.
It's like 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They entered the beach, all clothes in label clothes and bottles, in the hands, like otherwise, smartphonys.
That's about the private beach, it's not interested and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid.
They've got all the lights.
Whoever wasn't lying on him and was just in the sea, he had a chance.
They were dressed like the American rapper movie.
On the heads of the neck, white and coloured addictions on the feet.
Then they made the local beach bar and started walking.
They set the tables around, dressed themselves near the seat of snow and white bar gates - reading the Muslims and the Europeans without asking.
The mothers and the kids shot out of the eating terrace somewhere in peace.
The neighbors drinking a beer equal to the third - like in the US series? - on the beach they cut an empty bowls around them.
They continued voting on one another.
No, it wasn't that.
Then they put into the drink of wine, even from the wheat.
They shot into the hotel bathroom - in the marks, especially those young ladies - in the water of the rocks and rivers, mothers with children and grandparents have been scared and no longer at the beach or in the bassin, nor in a black host.
They all lost.
Notwithstanding whether someone was a Christian or a Music.
The hotel employees were afraid of them and just talking.
The reader said to me, "Have you seen the gold that they had?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they didn't really have it from the work," said the lawyer.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had around the crops of gold rows.
And one had about twenty-meter mass of gold cross.
And women were like goldenity.
"They're drug feeders?" I asked me.
"Behold, you have seen how they're crying," the chief answered.
Drogs don't worry, they don't eat.
They're burning something else.
So I've already had what they used to pass.
It was not so important for me in June 2105.
I didn't know what he would follow.
But secret services and top policies had to do this first.
I don't think they wouldn't know.
There were about 1,5 million immigrants in Europe at that time.
And they went and went and went.
Today, the main problem of the European Union is that totally-political-corrective policies, such as intellectual and related to them, are the greatest power of the lobby and economic groups in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the publicly recognised main force in Europe - lies, lies and lies - but not only they, as well as the EU and the TVs, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures of the overwhelming welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of Moscow TV photographs of August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunlights on the scene, but mainly - old - Muslims welcomed their companions.
During a long week, they bleeded in reports on the Czech TV, as the Germans were determined according to the rational research, almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
Of course, who was just a few days in Germany, he knows that it's lying like a gy.
Which confirms further information.
For example, a glorious research of public change organised ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companys of the Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take more insults a week ago.
That was our television, too.
In fact, they hide the second day of the wheat in Germany: in the review vote to the article, 94.5 per cent of Germans did not want any immigrants - 67.000 were involved.
It is true that the officer of Merkel publicly in November 2010, so five years ago, said, "Our effort to `multi-culti's community has completely failed."
Then she said, "The Germany is fighting for a multicultural company."
"Every effort for such a consciousness has been completely wrong."
In the country where four million Muslims lived, it seemed that a strategy that allowed people from different cultures to live with themselves without being integrated.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we're just living happily with ourselves, so this access failed.
That's a mistake.
However, not even Markel has the power to go against the powerful German and Europe and mainly against political correction.
It shows the scaling of the event.
The conflict increases.
Euronemec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, a lawyer for the SPD, the only one who has no maturity in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one about which Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said that he could play a supervisory in the concentration for a minute - as he had been overseen.
In particular, under the last statements of German policies, Germany seems to have overcome Rubikon.
Let us note that, in some cases, the majority of European policies does not support these statements, the states of the countries who were victims of nacism are afraid.
What happened to Germany?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
What years have they been trying, at least, to cope with their terrible past of the aggressor and killing millions?
Do those who say it is a devil of aggressivity, superstition and violence in Germany's soul?
Did the officer Otto von Bismarck have been right when he stopped the temptations of the Greatmen to control the entire Europe's middle?
When did he say that the German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he had.
When they left her, she started preparation for World War I.
The view of the Great Germany and Europe in two wars, which were millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After trying to control the state, such as the Rote Armee Group, and after the NDR failure, in Germany, an ecological basis, which was, for example, one of the main ideas of nacism, began to develop a new German ideology.
They said the sun.
German elites were protected by the result of the German nationalism, and thus left all those fights against the atom, the overseers seeking for all, quietly supported the old Caesarian and Nazi password Our boss must live.
In order to satisfy the unusual young people who want to do something different and better worldwide, they have completely joined the fight against the inflammation of the planet, they have stopped nuclear electricity, etc.
And they forgot that in this street there is also strongly antisemitic - suchly propalestinal - and antislovanic podium that considers all Slovakans as a potential verbege - since Karla Marxe, who, after the Jewish parents, was primarily the German nationalist.
And also, as shown by the last statements of Schulza and German minors openly threatening unfold states, the idea of the German leadership.
Whoever needs to listen without excuses.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we realize that the immigrants are a very powerful group of electors, we have what we have.
In addition, it stands as a party, especially the German, who is devoted to and who are those of the fact that Germany is governing the government of Europe's States, in fact through the banks and the Union.
The pseudowire of the solars first brought Germany into the ecological and multicultural field and brought them home and could still bring millions of Muslims.
Which, thrown up the voice of siren, will quickly come on the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they'll start moving.
Germany can only threaten his neighbors with strength, again part of his people - but, as it seems, still smaller part - ideologically disturbing, but finally the reality of it as possible.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslims are already burning.
What will the German government do when the public protests of Germans against the islamists' income?
Will Muslims already live in Germany to help, but will they, of course, never asimilated to take local habits and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalization of Muslims, Islamists and Germans will be released in themselves, following the fear of islamizing their country?
What will this do to Germany, and to Germany, when people who will vote and protest publicly against the new Euro-Muslims?
Germany just changed.
The conflict in Europe with the support of solar ideology, thus the elitary and principle of totality, and its non-saturable banks, grows.
And because of the uncommon negotiation of ungodly democracy Germans and all the subordinate and indigenous neighbors of the East, it cannot be a good effect.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to escape the swimming sellers: fearing them to die.
It's enough to slow down and a strong swimming on you in a way that weaknesses do not just need to fall.
The survivored head will make you swimming and swimming, leading to the road (which is more deceived) of an unnecessary seller and a survived socket.
Perhaps it's damage that the speaker's crazy can't even be arranged in the ability.

Brazilian pediat company Rio Grande propagates a healthy diet at the shopping
The Brazilian pediat company SPRS came with a shocking way to try to make women know about the importance of good food by using the pictures of children from the breast of the painting of an unhealthy eating.
Human mother milk is consistent of different proteins, ducks, vitamins and carbohydrates that add to all animals that are used to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess of energy requirements, we are recommended to increase the daily carriage income by 500 calories daily.
However, new reviews indicate that the increased income of calories is not the only diet measures to be conducted by the mothers.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnancy women have affected the genetic creation of their children and protected them from the development of people.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets had negative influence on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates taxes, although Nine's trying to overcome the lead in Today Show
By Karla Stefano and Lisy Wilkinson to Canberry for the cover of costs for the results of liberal management, it was not possible to create a sufficient increase in assessment for Today.
Dinner show Nine promised from a national hall after Malcolm Turnbulla Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with the host David Koche and Samanthou Armytage were in London as a part of a week of a long series of international TV transmissions, including Dubaj, New York, Niagaries waterpades and Cancun.
There seemed not to be a lot in this tirany of the Aussie TV wheels because it mentioned 397 000 wheels in five main cities compared to 330 000 districts in Today's sending.
Today was a smaller growth of its evaluation compared to Monday (317 000) and the past deterioration (283 000), but their number was in the past fourth (343 000).
Today, in the last months, fills the Sunrise area.
In August there were 318 000 in Today, compared to 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the sea moved between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has 349 000 birds and Today 314 000.
That's the most interesting thing that happened.
The wind changes today affect more than just Parliament, friends!
Karl and Lisa are good, thank you for the question!
Added to TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
A great message for Seven was a threatening debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama of a recent waterful father, which will decide to move with his two children to the direct part of the New Zealand, has a very active 1,219 million dishes.
Criticals thought that Thomson himself would be able to shoot TV hit without the star Rafters Rebeccy Gibney.
The conclusion of yesterday evening is going to be "yes".
The X Factor from Seven has left the strong 1,136 million wheels, whose colds struck the Block (838 000) and TBL familys (726 000)
Seven mentioned mixed follow-up last night the Chase.
The half half of the new television cycle (from 17:00 to 17:30), which said Andrew O'Keefe, had 446,000 wheels.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) sprang out to 623.000 wheels — which was enough for a small winning over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half of the Chase’s had 520 000 birds and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had about 620 000.
Thanks to the humiliation of the evaluation of the Chase of the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will finally win.
The Chase'a is replaced by a million dollars a minute that couldn't hurt McGuirow's show.
P's published as Sunrise dominates while Today remains local
Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect boy - but who will choose?
The secret was discovered?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwantedly proved who wins Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is embraced with an improper secret.
And three girls who are going to stay will not determine who's the right one that will finally get the road.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezani Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows day before they left two, they ungrately told us who wins.
Sam Wood holds the tongue for the teeth to the quarter final
All three women sang why Wood was a perfect man, felt his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positives as a dây, why they wanted to be his partner.
Everyone at the question, "When it wouldn't be, what would get Woodo's final flower?" They could have their answers worked as a switcher about who would get Bachelor's heart.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, so Markoskie named Mackay as this one that would be better going to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a easy relationship from the next day.
"From the moment I came home and observed the energy of Sarah and Sama, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still mean it through the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a real landing woman, it's a lot of pleasure with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemical between them.
It's good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could make Sam Wood a couple.
For herself, she stated that during his last visits home, she realized that Wood could be "the true."
"As I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a game - I opened him now all my heart," adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if she didn't eat, she was mysteriously faced.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I have both girls the same -- it's between Snezena and Lana increasingly.
Bachalor's sent to the middle at 7.30 to Den.
It was published as the best choice of Sarah for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his movement to the United States and many teams asked after his great start of the train at the end of the past year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsul and looks like a reasonable decision.
Some trainers left Hayne sitting after the rest of the seʹna because he made a mistake, which made a conversion of the Australian rugbian liga at the first exhibition from the overground at the outcome 20:3 on Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to return and put him into the game after Reggie Bush hurt.
Tomsula also was still sincere in the shot after the game.
Instead of getting the news in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly on printing § after storage.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, announced that Hayne also received an encouragement from the special team coordinator, Thomas McGίhey, who advised him to forget a mistake and only care for another game.
During the first quarter of Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne, he has made his error.
It was certainly not the start in which Hayne and his mass of Australian fanclub hoped in his NFL debut.
Hayne was accused of delivering when, after failing, he left out of the field and told the Australian radio spirit Hamish & Andy to 2DayFM 104.1 worse start of carrying in NFL, he couldn't even imagine.
"It's happening, you just focus on the next game and it's all," said Hayne
Hayne compared the traps to his pp-debut in 2007, when the replacement in its own territory leaded to Queensland three.
It was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published photos with fans on which he holds after the Australian flag game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin are meeting in the debate on homosexual rights
In 2003, the richest Russian man Mikhail Khodorkovski was arrested in the Syrian ranway guns.
After openly doubting President Vladimir Putina, Khodorkovsky was judged, his rop company Yukos was confusioned and his democratic efforts were concerned.
The U.S. became immigrants who helped the replacement of the property.
Two emigrated in 1984, and their neighbor became a new owner.
After 1989, the ownership was not able to be returned, therefore two returned to the state of a demand for a fraud in accordance with the Law on Mimosoid Rehabilitations.
The Court first added to them the requested amount, thus more than 2,8 million crowns, but their sentence changed so that he admitted them only 90 thousand crowns, with a reference to that the refund was determined in accordance with the price rules of 1991.
The Emigrants became the Supreme Court and added to them a deeply charged amount.
The Ministry of Finance to pay the money but turned back to US.
During the period, such changes have been made by social and economic conditions that the refund granted by the applicable legislation - would then represent the appropriate replacement in relation to the negative failure - is today only the degree of the value of the insolvency.
"This cannot go to the height of the neighborhoods in the refund of authorised persons who had their rights at least since 1995 and who did not have the opportunity to replace homes before," explained reporter Jaroslav Fenyk's judge, why the U.S. was on the side of the emigrants.
"US repeatedly stated that the general courts should be acted in refunding matters so that the ineffects may not be placed in the failure of authorised persons and to achieve the refund legislation, thus the opening of the property offences caused by the previous totality of the State," added the Court.
Evitu in the musical ́a DVA now opened by Fisher's Board.
Fishar's Council became the world's youngest Evita when in 1998, in its twenty years, she created the role of the wife of the argentin dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech statement of this celebrated musical Andrewa Lloyd Weber and Timea Ricea in the Prague Division of Spiral.
To return to the same role, he says, "Evit's commitment has not been equivalent to the power of representation today."
Evita, however, is not only a part of the role, it is also responsible.
At the first lady of Argentina, Monica Absolon recommended her.
I saw Monch three times in Evita, and it was absolutely inspiring for me.
I've seen a new idea right here once.
I'm increasingly a beneficiary of more moderate adjustments, but this is just a particular point.
"Regie of André Sokola is original, distracted and current," said Fisher.
A reasonable transmission of musical shoes between both songs will come to the Concert of Native Monique of Absalom 27 September from 19 hours in Divadeo DVA.
He's getting out of Evit musical tracks tonight.
It will certainly belong to the common duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Stop your cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of representations, André Sokol will also escape from the Registry Panel when it takes the role of Carla Roden's film in the role of President Perón.
For the purposes of the public interest, further terms were added to the sale until May 2016.
The five Czech World Music Study Evita provides divadlo DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.

In Andrés Sokola, the main role of the female role was studying Monica Absolon.
On her side, Karel Roden is shown by President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenačik.
Legendary song from the part of Tima Rice and Andrewa Lloyd Webber with the Czech texts of Michael Prostíjovski sounds to give a living orchestra under Christopher Mark, who was already shared in the first reference in the Spiral district.

Mr. Dhakal states that the police used the gas and then shot into the air before they moved to gum designers.
Twenty of police guards and five civilians were hurt, he says.
There was no immediate reason why gum projects, known for their ability to kill, but traditionally used as less mortal alternatives, apparently caused a high dead range.
This screen was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern Ne·lu mountain, where members of the ethnic group of Madeira say they have established a new province under a new establishment, and he has measured their political impact.
Other demonstrations in Western Nehl were also designated by the ethnic group of Tharus, which requires the exhibition of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people were killed in violent shots, including 11 police officers.
When the four main political parties signed the country's distribution agreement in the province — a great step to enter into the new position, but a very serious question in Nequel, which was centrally managed in the entire century.

The lawmakers in Kathmand voted in this week on the provisions of the establishment and the officers stated that the new chart should be adopted until Sunday.
We're not able to panic now.
After breaking on the ice of Lithuania, you didn't even get a householder with Sparty Hokeists (3:5).
You don't worry about a similar disastrous entrance in the extraligue as a year ago?
I hope it's not going back.
Honourable people.

The Google company left a campaign with the aim of choosing 11 million dollars for anger.
The Google Inc (GOOGL.O) reported that the campaign would start to choose 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations that helped thousands of European States to flee from the war of the poor and poor countries.
Google announced this in his blog a very unexpected way.
The report on her blog published the employee of Googlu Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience, when she was seven years old to her family from Kabul.
“We traveled in many dark wheels and buses, and we lived in hunger, distress, winter, and fear,” said Masoud.
I was lucky.
But the deteriorating immigration crisis in Europe is still more family like this.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-requested organizations that help the invaders and immigrants: Medicines without border, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google noted that all the contributions made through the google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled up to $5.5 million.

For slightly obsolete diabetes, chirurgical disturbance may be useful
Chirurgie deterioration occurrence for mildly obliged people with diabetes type 2 may take at least five years, according to the new study.
However, it is too quickly to say whether the patient with diabetes of type 2 lives longer after surgery of disturbance than those who have been given a non-hirurgic treatment.
"The execution of the death of the market to show," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, expert on the chirurgical surgery, who wrote a leader to a new JAMA chirurgic study.
Operations for deterioration, variational chirurgicals are used to reduce the decrease of different methods.
Decreases of hungry and human body limits to absorb food.
In the past years, variation operations were shown as possible for the treatment of diabetes type 2, but the survey was performed in persons with morbid obesity with body weight index (BMI) with a value of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measure the weight related to the height, is considered normal in values between 18,5 and 24,9.
The BMI values 25 or higher indicate the surface of the person and persons with a value exceeding 30 shall be considered obligatory.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Min-Sheng disease in Thai-wan have used data collected from the study since 2007, which includes two kinds of barrier chirurgical - scarce bypass and gastrektomy - in the treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes who were quite obliged.
The average BMI between those who undertaken operations has fallen according to the study from 31 to 24,5 to the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, BMI remained in those who have not been prescribed by chirurgical diabetes, the same amount of 29.
The diabetes was completely solved in 36 per cent and partly in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, the diabetes was completely solved in only 1 per cent and partly only in approximately 2 percent of patients.
Beforeward, the control of blood pressure, trigylcerides and "made" LDL cholesterol was shown "only better in the chirurgical group", the authors found.
Scientists also monitored the level of hemoglobin A1c in the blood that reflects the blood sugar heat in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is the best to maintain under the level of 7%, reports researchers.
After operation, the average haemoglobin A1c value was decreased from approximately 9 per cent per average of 6 per cent.
However, this value remained at approximately 8 per cent in the treatment group.
But this better "glykemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce death in five years, according to the main researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operation.
After five years, a group with bipass was lost more weight compared to the group of gastrektomy (18.7 to 14.2 kg), reached more BMI reductions (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c hemoglobin (3.1 per cent) and had more probability of diabetes removal (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not show improvement in the survival or chirurgie after five years, there are evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that chirurgie leads to the longer life, says Blackstone from the of Arõna College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obliged people who had undertaken the operation of bariate were about 29 percent of the chance to survive in the next 15 years, compared to the group that tried more conventional methods.
Although a new study has not shown a improvement in the survival of patients after chirurgical survival, it is, according to Blackstone, a quiet result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This work is critical here, because it indicates that the chirurgicals are safe in a group with lower BMI," it indicates without increasing the risk of death or renal disease.
Blackstone also continues to say that people and their doctors should begin to breathe the weight of reality seriously after the reduction of BMI patients between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too much for people to show the seriousness of the matter," he says.
I think if one time the replacement of these genetic changes that are strongly proposing their body with obesity and sugar, the way back is really hard.
"It is impossible to all come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to comprehend all the disorders, Dalai Lama introduced, and added that the real solution to the current emergency crisis is on the nearest east.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader invited to end the violence in the home country of rebellion.
Dalilama was addressed to the issue of the emergency crisis in his manifestation by opening Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is discussing ethical studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit of the Great Britain.
He stated that in the present circumstances, the interests of mankind should be rejected in the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also highlighted that the answer to the Western European countries, whether or not wonderful, was inadequate to the emergency crisis in this context.
"It is impossible to all come to Europe," he said in his words.
Although Dalai Lama appreciated the efforts of Germany and Russia in the crisis solution, he highlighted that it was just a temporary solution.
"To take care of a number of thousand rebels is beautiful, but you will have to think about the solution to bring peace and development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he explained.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce murder in their countries.
We have to limit the use of strength.
The use of power has never solved these problems," added.
When the question was resolved, Dalai Lama also discussed the complaints on George Bushe after the terrorist attack 9/11 and stated that "the violent reactions of the United States were called for a series of uncontrolled tasks.
After 9/11, I expressed a sincere compassion in the letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to resolve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and created unexpected investigations," he said to Dalila.
Four-fourth growth of the number of children who lived in health care in the last 4 years
The Toxicological Centre around the United States has reported a 400-percent growth since 2010 in the number of children to 12 years that have been highly healthy, according to the toxicological center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopeze, director of the Toxicological Centre of Georgia, the level of use of health care in children to 12 years reported at the eating centre has increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"Bys get to these products more frequently and unfortunately, the percentage of children are here, which must be brought to preparation," said Lopez CNN.
Some kids drink healthy cups in the meantime, while some want to make their friends thinking or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on Youtube show nactileties how they drink healthy hedge for a leaving visit.
The natives have evidently mixed the healthy hedge with the mouth water containing alcohol for stronger drinks.
Young children can be attached to the attractive wheat.
"The children don't think they could hurt them," Lopez said.
Although the most attractive (sanitation rubbers) are those who are parfumed.
For diposition, healthy cups with a heat of jaw, greep or pomegranates are very medical for children.
The sanitary hedge contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, a number of parts may mean alcohol grass.
"It's about highly concentrated alcohol," said the Fox 4 Station in Kansas City, a medical director of the Toxicological Control Centre of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let the whiskey whiskey screw like this, but people leave these health boxes out and when children get to them, it's a way to consume alcohol.
Nhajah Russel, a six-year girl who recently looked at the school up to four hours of a healthy worker with a furnace and was led to treatment for preparation.
Her level of alcohol in blood was .179, which is a double range of pulmonary values considered to be an adult, according to Dr. Chrise Ritchey, a ready doctor who cared about it in Gwinnett Medical Center outside the Atlantic.
Nhayah expressed invisible words and was not able to be conducted after she reached the preparation.
The doctors monitored them in a single child hospital for any signs of brain trauma because a girl falled and fell into the head, Ritchey says.
"It was very scared," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhayah's mother.
It could be mortal for my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and factors of use of non-alcohol products or to arrange for health care from childhood.
Despite alcohol greenhouse, some health careers were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after the destruction of a healthy cup containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Medicines believed that the product contains methanol, mortal factory, more than ethanol that was indicated as a active component.
In January, three students of the fourth year in North New York planned to remove their "what" factors by the location of anti-bacterial products after room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the health care and prohibited their presence in the room.
The police judged the dead plan as "invine trial" and referred to the discipline of the school quarter,
Fema: None of the Celtic Team
Griffiths bagatelizes the words of non-soulation in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he will turn it again.
Hearts will fight with the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton fears that the new shoes from January will overcome the team unit.
Dons increases their spring over Celtic by 5 points
Penalta from the first half of ADAMA Rooney's administration ensured Abberdeen to win Hamilton in Pittodrie, thanks to which Dons received a five-scale trail between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths supports the words of non-soulation
This is a challenge of the non-soulation in the Celtic, which was deceived by Griffiths, who does not work under any pressure of the increased supervision in preparation for the ships with the leaders of the Netherlands.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I think it's pretty happy for the player.
Missing in Scotland Title Rivality offers Netherlands - de Boer
The former leader Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claims that the Netherlands fans have lost the interest of Celtic - because there is no rivality between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently the leader of Ajax, says, "In Netherlands, they do not show it the best of the Celtics, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers anymore.
Now people are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both the teams of the teams, and they're just interested in it.
On the backs of the Old Company there's a big pressure and not only people from Scotland follow these games.
I'm turning things back to the good, Deil's binding.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little smart, but the Norwegian boss committed that things would turn back to good.
The Malm Power and the next outcome from Ligy Masters were followed by the wrath against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now runs on the top of the table with five-shopping.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already lived a bad period and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of that as soon as possible.
I know that it's very frustrating and that people's reality, truly harmful or cruel with the current action.
We're totally the same -- but we have to go on.
Actually, we really support Celtic because it's a much better player.
Now it's very important to stay with it.
Warburton is concerned about the ice position.
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his yellow targets, the boss Rangers Mark Warburton has anxiety of great purchasing and does not want to cancel the team unit from Ibrox.
The former boss Brentford says, "The flight transition window is very different from this year."
Players who arrive in the aerodrome have a whole presidential period of residence, which you could see on our own team this meal.
The team is really good.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really do.
The cross-border target of Celticu Michu indicates the outcome
Swansea Michu, who was connected to Celtic in the transitional window, indicated that after his disruption, Swansea could go to the east.
A twenty-year-old shooter has two years of problems with an increasing shooter and hasn't been able to find a way out of Wales this year.
Hearts will fight with SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts conducted 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the shot and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this round was rejected - one of the third red card issued to Colum, which was rejected.
Neilson stands behind his firm and says, "I didn't doubt integrity, I've not mentioned the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoid Tynecastle
The strong Hibbe was deeply deceived after he admitted that he sang a song with the text that was stuck for the former Hearts Rudolfu Scacel.
Incident was played in the field of Roserburn in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Darby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was about derba and it was a scared moment," the attacker introduced and continued, "I can safely say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, if it's in the Celticu dress."
Council in TannadiceØ in Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Council of Dundee United will continue in the correction of the current management of the team - but it recommends that the accident of the team must be completed.
I think Stephen Thompson's going to be inside us.

MCInnes is for the "supported winning" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team must have been able to keep up against Hamilton Accies so that they can get the seventh library winning after himself and the five-fifth shop in front of Celtic on the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half of Adam Rooney.
McInnes says, "It's not a team who has won anything, any of the pockets or the leaks, without wining this type of stocks."
Scotch unemployment remains unchanged while the total UK unemployed
INTERNATIONALness in Scotland remains without changes to the number of 164 000 in the period between May and July, while the total amount of unemployment in the United States was of 10 000 to 1,82 million during the same period.

It is exactly the year that Scotland has affected the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we were witnesses of further improvement in the work market and Scotch employment grows while unemployment was lost.
Why I was a Witness of Reparation in Oklahoma
After today, despite the late legal intervention, I'll follow the death of men.
It's happening, and I hope it's not going to happen, I'm gonna sit in the gallery in the Oclahom State's room of death and see Richard Glossip, who's gonna be restored to death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who will be witnesses to his death.
I first received a call in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day comes near, I'm starting to be afraid of it.
So why do I do that?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way I can tell you the whole story of death crime.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists have been allowed to follow the correction in America and because they are often more requested than free places, there is a morbid lottery that will decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever will be chosen will follow the whole correction uninquiredly.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit on the nearest friends of Richard Glossip, and I've created a special shot with him in months of phone, and one two and a half hour visit.
I like that guy.
We often smile when we talk together.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I'm allowed to have a note block and I'm able to mention what I'm going to see.
I'll have to remember all the details soon.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me to Twitter that I compromise my independence.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of chovance as it will be done to him, get access.
I tried her.
She admitted that " that could formulate better," but she also think that what I'm doing is bad.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I should write, and even if he did it, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could ever remove me from the list of witnesses.
But he wants a international journalist who will be ready to tell the story at the place.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the proceedings against death crime.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from Huffington Post, will be on my side.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to the series of subcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have affected him by the guilty of his companion on crime.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's innocent of the murder.
I determine to believe that there was no sufficient quantity of evidence to justificate death crime.
I think the correction is bad.
And just from this perspective I'll follow his death.
I can't say I'm going to be the objects.
You can turn to this phone to another journalist.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a man I've ever had to die for an unusual death.
The man's running from Canning River after the police boyfriend
The Watchtower Canning Vale remained sorrow after he released a man from Canning River.
The one of Peter's husbands, who fled by the police, didn't come out after he got into a small bathing water only a meter from the policeman who tried to convince him unfortunately to return to the front.
The police from Canning Vale was invited at an accident that moves to Beckenham in the attack.
When they saw a suspicious, he tried to get them out of the escape through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stayed in the water and repeated I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Guard Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want a uniform, so he tried to use a safeer tactic and this police negotiation."
"The people sometimes try to do when running a pleasant thing," said Castledine.
The football champion Ben Cousins gives a memory example.
In 2006, Cousins sent the car to the bus and tried to play through the Swan River.
His efforts were foolish, but he inspired locally to start planning Ben Cousinse biaton.
Peter Moody states that the computers tried to spie and threaten to the end of the trends.
Peeter Moody accused the agent Racing Victoria that he had been trying to get a spider and threatened that he would immediately end the divorce.
He focused on the ordinary and department of the integrity of Racing Victoria and rejected the conviction that he had a personal campaign against him with lady Tatai's later decreasing at holding on the day of the divorce, which was the last cup in the middle.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he was trying to do what was best for the injury and felt in difficulty for Lidarin to put a cobalt wind to a cobalt that couldn't explain.
He fell into the language about a spinner's accusation for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "sound terrible."
"I didn't want to say anything about that I've been sitting on it, but you just feel so frustrated that it's going to come out of you immediately," said Moody.
They know that's going on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the followers, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home today and sleep well.
Go up with the head and the owners think I'm doing the maximum for them.
If they start thinking back, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do my licences.
Before Moody released in his conversation for racing.com bomb that the integrity of the division tried to spare.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man - which I'd be called after a question - and offered him to work in my stages for the information about the things that I have been doing in my stages," said Moody on Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was an underwater.
It's like that, everyone should show his information because they're trying to catch me completely burning.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current President of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current director of RVL, were at the same time homes and are today.
Should I think that it's a personal matter?
Does the RVL give up a few bulls and order people outside the training position to take responsibility for what's going on in this future?
I'm wrong for this future?
I'm really so bad for this future?
Maybe more people now think yes.
Maybe they're gonna take my license and throw me away and I'm not sure what I'm talking to them now is a good material to think.
But I got in the point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm silent.
I was really disappointed.
I'm going to press them and bring them along with time to make decisions.
I have support for my family and I can go away.
The trainer's frustration hairs increased with an investigation for cobalt in the case of Lidar and the recent inflammation in it made it feel that "the hour could be his license on the table."
Mood, the most known for the preparation of an uninspired Black Caviar shampion, marked the rule of treatment on the day of the bathroom as "smile" after the horse was applied to the feet of a bleededed surface or a blue, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of dealing.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Someone of my team missed his feet.
He could have had it last night.
It could happen yesterday, and it also happened.
It happened on the day of a divorce.
Moody had a three-month disorder for the treatment of the cargos on the day of the divorce to which the computers had already opened the investigation.
It's funny.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand the rules we have, but this went too far," said Moody.
The Cobram driver who was arrested was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit the cycle on the weekend in Cobram and then left.
The cyclist was transported aircraft to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious hurt after the main route of Murray Valley was installed on Saturday.
The police noticed that the engineer was gone without stoping and helping the hurt driver.
On Monday, the fifty-year man of Nathalia himself admitted the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of not stoping in case of accident, disability and other transport crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital in a stabil state.
Trener Melbourne Storm’ig Bellamy returns to rivals because of the wrestling firm
Bellamy, leader Melbourne Storm, criticized the steps of his players as "building a plan" for two NRL favorite premises.
Trent Robinson, Dr. Sydney Roosters, said that they decided to allow the Storm players to "speak" his player during the controversial winning of the Storm team in Sydney's finality on Thursday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made a lightly embraced note on Strorm after his team wined finally ≥ North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening when he called the game as a "speeding" rabbis and according to two of Queensland were not "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy protected his players' steps and said they were focused on "contakt".
Bellamy added that these clusters increased his self-consciousness because his team is criticized by two leaders, which may mean that he fears the destruction of the Storm team.
"I don't remember that Trent Robinson would talk about the westling when we were hit 24-2," he said in the middle of Bellamy.
I can make sure that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and technology in the last weeks, we have just put contacts in the past year, and it means to turn to us.
Trent has already been here for three years and is obviously training a great team, so it is probably not usual to lose what could be a little shock.
It's grateful how such things come into this year's part.
Bellamy deceived Bennett's idea of "absorptingbal" and reminded his ment that Bennet's team wined in 2010 by the preliminary game of "need" ball.
Wayne's talking about an exciting ball.
He had the right in that his Sabbath game was similarly exciting as ours. He was also as exciting," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized because they were a poor team and Wayne said that it was completely one.
But now he has a team that can play a game that seems to him disgusting, especially his young composers with their ownness.
You would like to play such a game if you had this type of players available.
This opinion said in 2010, and now he wants all teams to play his bal - but not every team has two bookmarks such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so such a team can't play.
It's more self-conscious in me, because they say such things, because they're intimidated against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they reached a great relief.
Bellamy also showed that Storm and Roosters falled more than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos team game was probably good, I didn't look, but what's the skin? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two other trials, but is it a surprising ball?
Or is it interesting that the stops and non-recurrence of the trials are interesting?
I think that's the calendars.
When they never mention us, it means that we're going to meet again in a phase.
Storm has this weekend breakfast and they won the right to host or North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Sunday evening in AAMI Park. The letters will be selling from the next shopping.
Serbian man received a shopping 200 000 USD for drug accusation
A man who had a potential survival of 40 kilograms of cocaine, which was exposed from Queensland, received a buy of 200 000 USD.
Marko Maxsimovic (29 years) was one of the five men who arrested the Federal Police last month after 100 kilograms of drugs from Solay's jachto, which came from South America through Vanuatu, and in August he caught in Coomera.
Maximovic was watched at the meeting with those accused in the office during the afternoon and started meeting them in Coomera Roadhouse cabinet, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Despite the potential trial of experience for the owning of cocaine commercial quality, a lawyer Maximo put aware of that there is no evidence that he would own the whole amount and that it could be completely in the café and innocent.
The judge of the Supreme Court Peter Flanagan believed that Maximiovic would rise.
He's got a rough link to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
In the root case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Mother and the non-private father Maximo offered a cook of 200 000 USD for his release.
"By reading of the promising statements of both persons, it is obvious that the cup of 200 000 USD is a financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their effort was apparently inadequate because the accused was not yet at the court.
Maksimovic was made a cow under the submination that seems as the Australian and Serbian pass, it will be reported to the police daily and will keep the prohibition of exit from 18 hours to 6 hours.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to invite pedofils to send pictures
Pedofil used the phone of the 11-year-old girl to get a child injury.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, then he logged in her online chat, where she had a lot of unbelieving photos of the kids who sent him another holder.
The girl then tried and tried to miss her phone and then found him in the hand of Hogga's sleeping hand.
She went through him and before she warned her mother, she found anxious news.
Police entered and saw five photos, then the analytic computers found the address and showed "inquired" search on the web using expressions to search for children's images.
Hogg then told the police that his debt was "boating pedofils" on the Internet before he "respected that he was a police officer and feared them."
The Fiscal Representative Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that the search on the computer was carried out, but he says he just wanted to imagine that he was a police officer to scare pedofils.
He was asked for his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another.
He's doing it because he's hit them.
He claims that he's gone into drinking and said he wants to see the images of violation and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found messages on her phone, he called her mother, she cried and wept.
She saw no pictures on her phone, and then he was disappointed.
The girl was listened and talked about how sorry he used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls that looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a resident in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted the wine to grant a complaint regarding the adoption or providing inadequate images of the child on 14 June the past year, dismissed the cabinets of 25 January and did not be heard by the court on 24 March of this year.
Gregor Sim's lawyer requested that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual delicts, because he could argument that in his work there was no "principal sex subtext".
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael sent the judgment on October for the report of social workers.
Hogg was in this case made a cow, but he was held in the wallet before hearing about the final unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual delicts before his judgment date.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe proposed a bad demonstration in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest of African leader, before this year he fell on the stages of leaders to the ground.
He was not hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening Parliament has also been contaminated by the statements of opposition legislators that they have received anonymous exhibitions by murders which were warned before Mr. Mugabe during his manifestation.
The past month, he was exposed and caused during his demonstration of the status of the people in the Parliament, which is the word that he repeatedly had.
The President of the Democratic Change Club (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition policies adopted text reports on their mobile phones with warning to prevent the manifestation of Mr Mugabe.
"The report comes from the numbers that don't appear but is called "mort"," he reported to the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's words.
It warns the members concerned to ensure that the immunity ends in Parliament and their parliamentary immunity does not work as long as a year from Parliament.
The Chairman noted that the side of Morgan Tsvangirai has "cookies" regarding the exhibition of missions.
Hewlett-Packard wants to reduce the number of jobs to 30 000.
Hewlett-Packard cancels 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in its efforts to restructure and support the costs of business services.
In this year, HP will share in two companys cotted on the board and separate trade with computers and printers from their growing operations of fire hardware and services.
The expected reduction of the number of workplaces will be the result of the change in the range of $2,7 billion and at the beginning in the fourth quarter of the HP statement.
"This restructuring activity allows us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," Meg Whitman, the general director of HP and the president of the representative, which will be in the head of the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more sophisticated than today and will have a broad and extended trade portfolio that will help business transmission to new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to comply with the demands of our clients throughout the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have more than $50 billion after the company has announced an annual receipt and "the company will be focused on providing unconcurrently integrated solutions".
This will happen to the distribution of the company which the Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard's University found in 1930, manufacturing electrical equipment, and whose garage in Palo Alto was overwhelmed by the Silicon Valley's birth.
The HP community has passed a mass of reorganization in order to enable transmission from traditional personal computers to mobile equipment.
This HP company, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical fires in America, is the latest of this sector based on conviction that the specialised company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikkel Arteta says that the partners have to get to the hurt Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also highlighted for Wilshere that it is still just September, and if his rehabilitation goes in accordance with the plan, it doesn't be able to play for the nights again.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly mix at least four other Arabic games and, in view of the history, its involvement in the next European Agency is evidently uncertain.
The big damage of this newer problem is that Wilshere has completed the past a strong one after the craft and then again reached the former form during the president.
"This kind of hurt doesn't threaten the career," says Wenger.
It's the one who requires treatment.
It doesn't care about anything special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his kidneys or the hurt he suffered before.
This could be from a clean medical view of the truth, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of other hurt when any player returns during the season.
There's an inappropriate pattern here too.
The examination carried out by Premier Injuries Ltd. mentioned 23 different hurts of Wilsher since he had his hero debut six years ago.
During the last five years, he only played in 65 liquors of Arsenal from the total number of 157:
From the larger perspective for Arsenal, it means that in the sixth of the eight session from 2007-08, one of the two Premier League Clubs was lost most days from the damage.
Wenger accepts the potential of the repeated circle, but Arsenal will make it possible that improvement in the wounds mentioned during the last season will continue.
"As you come back after the hurt, you have a hurtful period, the time you can strengthen your body and get competition," says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilising, I'm sure he'll have a career he'll deserve.
Arsenal starts a campaign in Liz Shampions on the middle night against Dinamo Zagreb with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next center, and Wenger is ready to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not sit in Croatia, meaning that Matthieu Debuchy and Artet were probably deceived.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nao Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and leave players who do it, breathe," says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a favorite of the F group, Maximir in Zagreb has a story of the most terrible stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not destroyed in total 41 battles after they had held the campaign "incooperable".
The stadium was spent at the midnight by the landing 3.2 degree of Richter.
That was this year in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal learned from the past Ligy Shampions when he acted against Monaco and remained remote to him to bring a club to the first victory in the European Future.
"This saddle is horrible," says Wenger.
It never happened to the arsenale.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I must be realistic.
We're ambitionary, but we're not snow.
FriendsFest: Comedial show that gives us serious teachings about man's friendship
Absence of similar displays in different shows is in the sight of the shooting, especially because of the need for men to open more deeply than whenever, as regards self-mortality between young men to 15 years.
In 2013 there was the only biggest cause of death in men in the 20-45 years in the United Kingdom and remains three times more frequent in men than women.
In trying to resolve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) 2015 as the Year of the Man, whose goal is to doubt the culture that prevents men to seek assistance in the case of need.
The heart of this battle is a friendship for the fulfillment of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 mediumschool students showing depression symptoms has proved that in the case of a damage had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthing," their chance of delay was doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not in depression, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents half chances for the result of mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be at first adequate.
In this communication through social media with a view to communication and not to the scope of the communication, the immediate response is often predicted before the meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need was doubled to look stronger, more loving and successful, even though we are actually more isolation.
This surface of success is controlled by what psychological names are called external values; money, image, social status, all to our ambiguous values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which has deep influence on our mental health.
And as one billioner and her creators recently explained, money really doesn't have any greater happiness.
The nice series of Friends was for the source of this thought.
No one of the positions has been defined by his work, but by their personalities that have been saved by friendship interactions.
Joey's humor and Chandler's often victims, a moment of monitoring the ball on a pleasant cross, Ross' desire after Rachel, all the springs of knowledge that, yes, men can also be charged with it, even if they leave their feelings for themselves.
As a Samaritan worker explained to me: ..."My role of listeners who feel depression or have self-smorded clusters has actually confirmed me that even the smallest friendship interactions can be divided."
People who contact us often feel unable to communicate with your friends.
The old order "reaching with it" is strong in the sense that it will be considered as weak to resolve problems.
Friends are one of the orders that will come up in my memory when I'm trying to offer a better balance mechanism.
It highlights a small châi in a man's friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of the outside on the phone helps people in a few minutes of disfellowship, but the support must be closer, from the network of friends and family.
So this weekend, you're going to be at the FriendsFest ordered Comdy Central station, why don't you know your friends on the bottom to Central Perk, where the interior for the opportunity of celebration will be completely processed.
Or when you see somebody alone in Starbucks, let's laugh and salute him.
You never know what kind of division your friendship can do.
Serial Friends will be sent to the Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
In Mary, he covered and helped the PSG with Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blais Matuidim and Edinson Cavanim after the shooting against Malma.
Angel Di Maria was stuck at his debat in Liz Masters and thus helped the PSG to hurt the Swedish team Malmo.
Here's a story of reactions and reactions on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani have been thrown in the travel and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in Lize Masters with final comfortable winning 2-0 against Malmu to Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot less than four minutes after his debut in Liz Masters, and this PSG player sent French champions after winning, but then they lost some chances, until they finally increased their shooting when Cavani shot his head in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in the group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they are not only focused on the racing rounds but to improve their roads to the quarter final that they mentioned in each of the previous three years.
But although they got three points, it wasn't the classic effect of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a marnotic team before and was determined against his home team and the club in which he started his career in 1999.
"In Lisa Maestros is not easy to win outside or home, so winning 2-0 makes our problems and looks likely in the defence is a good beginning, even if there are things we'll have to improve with the process of improvement," said Bla.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two more.
Ibrahimovic returned after he was hurt as one of the three changes of the PSG team, who held this weekend 2-2 with Bordeaux in Liza 1, but was stuck Di Mariou in the fourth minute.
Argentina's clay was marked as a man who moves PSG in Europe to a new level after the transition from Manchester United, who passed last month, and showed why when he attacked Marca Verratti for the defense of Malma and sent a shock for Johan Wilanda to a remote angle.
However, if anyone expected that this would start a great PSG winning, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who killed Celtic in play-off and reached this phase, came with 9 internationals in the basic composition and five dealers and two inquired bookers were hard support.
But besides the shoots of Nikola Djurdjice, who just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trappa in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSGs themselves were looking forward to the advantages of the attack of bad records and mixtures, which were not good nor by Ibrahim, who couldn't shoot five times in the first half, and then was disappointed because his shooting reached the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
Yet, he showed much more appropriate when he came to prepare a chance for his partners and it was just from his playing when Di Maria sent a closer shot that ended in Wilanda’s chair after 52 minutes.
The second → finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayec sent the head on the side of the sixth season after Ibrahimovic gained him after playing from the left wheel from Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts of Malma about the possibility that they could get something out of the stock, and only the excellent progress of Wilanda from the great neighborhood was deceived on David Louis and the skin remained unchanged even in the moment when the coaching Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the bathroom.
The trainer of the Malmo Age Hareide team admitted that the PSG were higher than his team, Nor said, "Our last game in Lisa Mysters has passed in the past year."
Since that time, we've just played a Swedish person that is not at the same level.
Qualification facilities are lost.
The depth down for Paris.
For them, it was an exciting story.
Glencore's company has made $2,5 billion for sales of action
The Glencore weather gigant with a seat in Switzerland, which was assigned to co-country prices, has made in the middle of $2,5 billion from the sale of action in its total plan to reduce the debt.
The Glencore company states in its statement that she sold a new share in a value of approximately 6 billion £ to pay the duty.
This company, who has lost 57 per cent of its market values for years, is decreased by commodity prices because the Chinese economic decline reduces the request and rewards the insurance of the market.

Glencore community discovered last week that the sale of actions in value $2,5 billion is part of the larger plans to reduce their debt $30 billion, which was replaced by approximately third
The company sold a new action in the price of 123 pensions for action, which means 2,4 per cent of a closing price in the deterioration.
So 1,3 billion actions were released at the total price of 9,99 per cent per group.

Like the oprchlic crisis, the Shanghai Space was dismissed.
The news lights from Germany from far away did not steal the European envelope, but it has already made a ship to change the course, wrote the French journal Le Figaro.
The European Union has decided on Monday to resolve the problem of emergencies: it will be more systematic to classify the asylum and the asylum applicant as soon as it goes to the old continent - in particular in Greece than to take place for the future division of injuries in accordance with the quota based on the quantities that are still more distorted in reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker requested 25 of the 28 EU countries to re-distribute 160 thousand disabilities, the ministers changed the priority within the Member States.
Before looking for the final destination of the run, it is necessary to filter those who come today and resolve the judgment of those who are already moved within the Schengen House.
"The management of the EU's external borders is necessary for control," it is highlighted in the text of the negotiated Ministry on Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis of a common currency, the EU finds it in danger in its next large integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it doesn't handle its decision and increases the pressure.
It renews the controls of the rational controls, in particular with the Russia, but without blocking the impact of those seeking asyl in this country.
The central power shows that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
As a evidence, it has already served that Russia and Slovenia have been attached to this measure on Monday.
Poland, Netherlands, Italy and even France also consider it, even though with different intensity.
Hungary has been added to it for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are authorised in accordance with Schengen rules.
It's about the dominant effect, but he sees the blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now the introduction of mandatory income controls in Greece, South Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed into the interior.
The French Minister inside Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière acted intensely on this during their private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This isn't a new idea, but it's going to be a disturbance.
In Italy, it was already registered and identified by the collection of two thirds of new incomes of running fingers.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any input point in its territory, because they fear more than the endless, so that the camps in which the winds would be thrown on her.
Greece remains a real black bowl.
On his islands near the Turkish village, more than 200 thousand people were attended in the year, which was two times more than at last reached Italy.
Most of them are asylum requesters who came from Syria immediately after the overflowing camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a big hot opening.
Atenas, which are still in financial divergence and waiting for a new government, put their hands into a clone.
This is the default point for the Balkan Road and the source of the current common age for the German office of Angela Merkel and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Commission of Juncker promises that the control points will be introduced as soon as possible, but it has not introduced any number or date.
"The calls to Greece are related to all Europe," the EU Ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
This is, therefore, to address the European Agency for the Control of Frontex's border team in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece to expand its capacity for asylantic receipt and strengthen the monitoring of the islands.
"The needs of financial resources will be attached," warns the text submitted to the Ministers to approve.
In view of the rights they will continue to have the last word of Atena.
The question of the survey of European guards was not officially raised, but Europe is closer to it.
The new nutrition of the eight-year-year-olds, as it was, addressed to the second series of issues of committed quotas and 160 thousand deficiencies, which the Commission of Juncker and the European Parliament had taken up in the beginning of the year, and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Holland.
Hungary, Slovenia, Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear.
They think it's an attack on their superiority.
On the beginning, not but the obligation, it was held in the text of the approved eight-year-old text.
But as a political commitment.
Otherwise, the process has been cancelled.
The only strong promise includes the transfer of 40 thousand in the next two years, which has already been reached by the agreement in June during the EU hectare summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead below the lawyer in Al'ch, of that, evidently three Czech.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed a lawyer in the French Alées.

The previous media reports knew that it was about Paul.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious hurt of the feet in the stone bones.
The dead have been created by the AFP increasingly four centers.

He believes that Liberec can also introduce Braz.
We're waiting for a team that will be strong on the middle, even if it's disciplined for them.
They are playing from 4-4-2 with a severe transition to an attacking phase.
"It's a very hard contrast, though we've discovered weaknesses, but it's the most important way our players' players are going to go on to the game," said Trpišovski.

In the country of Karlovar, there may be a new league division.
According to the headman of the Carlovar country of Jakuba Pánika (CSSD), the current capacity of two national diseases and two private diseases in the country should be made sufficient and longer adjustments based on agreements between individual disease divisions.
In the country, however, there are also the possibilities of enlargement of care.
For example, in the division of chirurgical divisions, a single-day surgery center could result in the operation of chirurgical works that do not require hospitalization longer than 24 hours.
In which specific diseases the work should be addressed to a single-day surgery, it is not yet possible.
In the skin division of Karlovy Vary’s hospital, the laser centre could resume with the possibility of use of laser technology for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the survival of the apal centre, which would take care of patients with the brain in the vegetative state.
Such a centre should be designed centrally and should be the integral part of the anestesiological and resurrective division.
There is also a possibility to concentrate such equipment in the island hospital where similar care already exists.
Other chemical capacities that appear to be inadequate in the country of Karlovar are the lamb of follow-up care, especially the leaf of Medicines during the period of sickness (→N), whose capacity in the Netherlands is inadequate and should especially focus on the liver of acute care.
Part of this equipment should work as a rehabilitation dog and a part as a classic LDN liver, recommends the concept.
As it warns, the lamb of the next care is mainly missing in the Carlovy Vary hospital.
There they could use leaved buildings after centralization.
In the past, in Karlovar country, social health beds are absent by Alzheimer’s treatment.
This bowl is insufficient in the entire Republic, so it can also serve for the rest of the countries as such as Alzheimer Centre.
In accordance with the recommendation, hospitals should also be prepared for the execution of such appeal to be released by the financial assets of European agencies.
"Every of the dogs that will take care of the subspecialized care and will create a Patience Translation Area after the progress, such as cardiochirurgical, neurochirurgical, transplanting or other steps," describes the national concept of league care.
New services could also be offered in psychiatric care.
