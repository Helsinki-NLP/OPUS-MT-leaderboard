And if the Government decides that a section may act as he wants - to go with the committee and the Government accepts it, then the Chapter may go, but if the Government decides that part lists are all parts of what the Government has adopted, then it is the decision that all sections form part lists.
And if it is not with the Government, then it is to stop the membership and go with the committee," he adds.

Proposal cats and dogs must be marked in microschemes
The President of the Committee on the Environmental Environmental Affairs of Mazeki and the other members of the Seminar Registration of the law of the Life's welfare and law, which proposes cats and dogs to be binding for the marking of subsequent microscames.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be binding on the marking of poodical microscames and their registration and labelling of the locality, the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, the State funds will be freely labelled all dogs, and the 2020 - still - and cats, and thus will cover a specially intended state financing,” said the President of the Committee on the Environmental Affairs of Mazekia.
It is intended to establish a systemic signature for the labelling of home animals.
In order to avoid problems, it will cause unresponsible animal plants, irregular multilaterals or sellers.
Preliminary estimates are estimated that, in accordance with the potential price of micro-schemes and services, the transitional period of approximately 5 euros will be assigned to all animal persons.
The total price of all animal plant labels may be of 6 million euros.
It is planned to divide funds in three years and each year after 2 million euros.
It is expected that the funds for the labelling programmes will be granted through the special programme for the environmental framework of subsidiaries, which will be significantly increased in this year because of the increased resources and the distribution of resources.
These funds can be used not only for the labelling of cats and dogs but also for castrations and other programmes.
According to Mr. Majeko, the binding marking practice has been extended nearly in all European countries, it allows the same animals to be able to be restored to owners (in this case, it is easy to return to owners) and has combined the time of their own animal plants when the refuge and submission of vegetation is required to provide a lot of time and funds.
In addition, the EU legislation provides that a number of ways are possible only with pollutant plants.
At the same time, the marking is prepared to take care of the animals of his whole life.
Previous proposed marking was committed to the opposition, since the relevant programmes were proposed to be financed by people's funds.
"The model of this criteria should now be avoided, since animals are proposed to financ the increased income in the environmental framework programme and the right to mark not only for veterinary treatment but also for the publics, such as the person of animals' globe institutions, who have heard special courses in the veterinary academy," said the authors of the project.
The draft legislation is registered by different Seim groups - County Majeika, Algimant Dumbrava, Eugenia Gentvil, Edmund Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

A lawyer in Russia, who worked in Janukovyest, was granted to Alexander Goroshinski to register in the register of foreign lawyers until 19 November, so that he could attend the meeting where the Janukovitch, as you think, will be like his last word in the video.

On the second day, the group of the Christian Democrats of Sime’s father-in-Lithuania (TS-LKD) reported that the group of Seim members had been sent to the KT, investigating the compliance with the rights of the Law for the management of residues adopted by the Governing Board.
"Parlaments highlight that the provisions of the legislation are intended to celebrate projects of waste burning devices currently, by establishing new restrictions to the Government (20 km distance from the residence territory) until the introduction of the legislation in Vilnius and Kaune's forces to build waste fuel forces," it is written in the report.
"Parlaments note that in the way the prohibition made by the law to build residues insurance objects (e.g. the distance and define the concept of "residency"), it concludes that this prohibition is unproportionally restricted or even authorised to carry out the same right to carry out animal activity relating to waste fuel, because the designation of the ability to formulate so that, when assessing the tension and distribution of Lithuania people in the country, such objects would be practically inappropriately not possible in the entire country's territory," it is added to it.
Let us say that the law adopted is contrary to the principle of the constitutional law.
"The CT has not once indicated that legislation does not apply the legal facts and effects of those who have occurred before the newly adopted legislation.

The Court of Justice proposes to refuse the limitation of 20 km from 1 January 2019.
This section is planned to be discussed at the remaining Seimous Round session.
However, the right of the Government to stop the projects already started is not planned.
KT will take this case to pass not before the year.

Reveled in "Lion Air" a flight disaster: the influence of the dead neighbors
The data of the Black Package of the Indonesian Air undertaking showed that during at least four last of its lack of speed work, the investigators reported on Monday.
The President of the National Transport Safety Committee (NTSK) said that the similar rate was at the end of the four last aircraft, the late, when the next day was deceived in the Java sea on October 29, immediately after the arrival from Jacart.
During this disaster, all 189 airports were killed.
A lot of newspapers reported the "Boeing 737 MAX 8" airport from Denpasar to Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem of the outcome was the speed of the air, in other words, the air speed," Mr. Tahjon said through the pressure.
"The data of the black box showed that over two times before the travel Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," added he.
"In social networks, there are many shepherds.
Now we want to explain that in the Black Package (the data issued) about the four issues that caused problems on the speed airport," said the NTSK leader.
During the meeting with the members of the fisheries, Mr. Tahjon said that the information of the entry recording data corresponds to the notifications that the speed and height of the aircraft will be changed indirectly.
The search command has not yet been found in the second black box that contains conversations in the pilot cabine.
"Lion Air" indicated that throughout the Bally to Jacart, the technical disorder was fixed in accordance with the recommendations of the employee.
One of the enterprises Rusdi Kirana has not been invited to submit to the meeting of the Minister for the meeting of Buddi Karya Sumadi, a moderate meeting of members with the officers, supervising the aircraft and the search of residences and the investigation of disasters.
However, he stood up and disturbed the head when the members of the pressure and demanded that Mr. Kirana, together with his brother Cusnan in 1999, would be assigned "Lion Air".
"Lion Air" was wrong," said the man, as a traveler of Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a prosecutor in the island in which the flight was running, father.
"When Mr. Rusdy Kiran and his team would give attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air never contacted me from the beginning of the crisis.
We don't get our kid, but "Lion Air" doesn't show us any returns."
After this meeting, Mr. Kiran followed by avoiding the issues of journalists.
Many are expecting the results of the long-term recognition process.
Police medical experts have been transmitted nearly 140 lavone-masters in support of people.
Only 14 have been recognised until now.
The families asked the question when the other person was started two months ago was allowed to run, despite the deadline from Bali to Jacart on October 28, and otherwise, the resource of the traveling travel aircraft was thrown down immediately after the arrival.
"Lion Air" said that this deceiving was able.
Is it true that the problem was clear? - asked one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technicals must be taken into account.
The law was very clear, and they did not say that the aircraft was allowed to rise again.
These bad technicians must be responsible in accordance with the law that aircraft disasters will not be repeated in Indonesia.
Mr. Tahjon said that the large quantity and the fact that the deterioration is too lower in the small area shows that the other is actually throwing into the water by running much more rapidly.
"The flight was the only one when he fell into the sea.
He didn't run air, but the air carriers, when he dropped the water, worked with a big wheel -- that shows all the thoughts of the nearby turbine," explained the officer.
Lion Air is a flying disaster in Indonesia since 1997, since the Air Air Air Air was combined with nearby Medan's airport, 234 people died.

Presidency: No reference facilities are required
The Chairman of Mindaugas Lingua, after approving the proposal of the Governing Board to reduce the reference card to the first section of the Constitution, states that the President is adjusted to the veto.
"For more than half of the people of the Constitution, this is a requirement.
This is also its change, especially the articles in its first section , that should be not less than the majority .
I'm not sure that the President would really have a wheat," said the Knowledge Radio on Wednesday to the Internal Policy.
It focuses on the definition of the basic states in the first section of the Constitution - language, afternoon, territory, sovereignty, so that the amounts for these articles to change the needed number of votes, as Mr. Linges, would be created "nea-nea-a-risks" and "reverse uncontrolled risks".
"In the opinion of the President, there is no need to facilitate, I need the same reference, I need more dialogue with people," he hoped.
The seventh day is planning to vote on the adoption of the Reference Act.
It provides that the decision on the higher position of the Constitution shall be adopted by the first and fourteenth of the first and fourteenth Section, where it accepts at least two fifth of the citizens having the rights of the selection.
Articles of the first and fourth section of the Constitution may now amend more than half of the citizens of the vote right.
In Lithuania, the right of marketing has approximately 2,5 million citizens: half is 1,25 million billion billion billion, two five - a million billion.
This proposal was born after the approval of the president's vet in September on the previous adjustments adopted in Parliament, and lighting the requirements for the number of balls in terms of the definition of Article 12 of the Constitution.
The referendum is proposed to decrease the reference to the double citizenship, which should be held on 12 May and on 26 May in the first and second term of the Chairman's votes.
Emigravates after the reconstitution of independence are currently on 11 March 1990, except for some exceptions, cannot be double citizens.
Duplicate citizenship is aimed at the world's shipholders, but it is afraid that a referendum in the present conditions would not be able to vote - not to have enough numbers of people.

"The state of the streets until it doesn't be better, because the funds are not allowed enough.

I believe that the proposal to continue to return home is absurd, because the roadways in Europe were going to be empty, burned, increased emission.
Most of this, we're happy to be iron parts, because we'll be able to get part of the transport to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our position," Mr. Masuily said.

In fact, the VRK leader did not leave that if Seime had rejected the president's veto and new adjustments on budgetary partitions this or the next week, the Commission could consider a decision on additional contributions to individual political forces, and LSDDP.
"When we take the decision, we will return to the entire existing legal environment, because we are a mental institution to have the laws adopted," she said.
If Seimas could be able to reject the vet and new laws, the Government of additional moneys for parties would, in accordance with them, have increased the amounts concerned.

The Health Agency has declared that the decision to prohibit all products with pesticide metame was adopted after a new safety check started in this year, at least three September before the Department of Meno and Luar.
