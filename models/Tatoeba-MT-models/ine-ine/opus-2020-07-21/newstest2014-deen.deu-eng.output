Gutach: More security for footpassers
They are not remote 100 metres from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 foot-to-site box was carried out at the village park - in the view of the old rath-sample.
Two installations are so close to each other: a view or a gun citizen?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's citizens yesterday.
"The rath sample has been installed at that time because they are safeguarding the school road," said Eckert yesterday.
The Cluser-Ampel was safe both radways and bus carriers and the mountain-habitants.
The installation taken in operation is important for the crossing area of Sulzbachweg/Chirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the busholder, one Ar and a bank and the flow of the residence area ›Grub›.
"When the high depth and footpasser arrival had to have a more deal with their security," said Eckert.
This also works Peter Arnold from the Landscape of Offenburg.
"So the current measurements are carried out on the B 33 daily approximately 12 000 vehicles the Gutach community, which are about ↓ Pro ́ Sweet transport," says Arnold.
So the building of another ample is more than necessary: "Security is just going here", as Arnold.
In total, four exhibitions were carried out, and a circuit traffic was also advised, however, because of the enemy in the crossing area of Sulzbachweg/Chirch Streets.
Arnold was stated at the location of the amplemasters before all: "The middle of an extra for us with specially long wood-loaded transporters we have equipped whether these vehicles can go out of the swimming road to B 33 without covering the amplemasters."
The approximately 15 000 euro tears are the "modernest thing that is on the market" stated by Arnold.
The installation is equipped with colourful LEDs that look so powerful that the lights of the car vehicles, for example, are well recognised in the deep sun.
And she is also cool: the elderly light facilities consume about 100 Watt, the new eight waters just once.
There are three light facilities per vehicle.
Arnold explained the technology of the new installation: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the footpasser presses the applet button, the above radar sensor tests the processes.
If the street is free, it comes directly green for the footpasser, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be finished for the footpasser.
"When a group or prevented people go over the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone comes safe over the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the car vehicles here must think as partners and watch the trains.
This wasn't the case yesterday: while showing the ample for footpassers green, a high-class vehicle sprinkled through - in lighting red.
Joseph Winkler has written the need of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the hang too rare violence and tough sexuality, the anxiety and freedom - has described the nuclear dinner of many times.
The Büchner pricemaker is known, especially as prosa, theater texts are in Work rare.
Collage from procsatexts Gerhard Fresacher provides for its introduction "Weatherlights on the language point", which is now to see in the Garage X at Petersplate, so a collection of process texts.
The theatermaker connects about elements from the autobiographic designed Roman "The Leibeigene" (1987) with the processing of "Leichnam, his family beauauarnd" (2003).
On the broadly empty bowne - important requisit: a scarced sofa, which is collected and masturbated in the spirit - the eight buying en ́s with the text material.
It seems to have a little trust in the text.
The 70-minute performance overviews the template with a FÃ ̈e of ray incidences, from the postdramatic games repository.
In particular, the spectacular games come to some questionable Chinese transactions.
They are hardly touched with the head under water, cutting their abdomen to the wall.
Anyway, in Zellophan or Mi, they stack up high stones by the inscenation, or they monologize sounds or lie completely understandable on the bottom.
However, the text does not refer to this adjusted manner.
The best moments have the evening when sing - the band width is enough from Deep Purple to national song.
First at the end, the overdressed instruction comes to rest, and the Winklers' afternoon absurd humor arose.
A Blackbox in the car?
US travel planners are searching for a source of money to repair the highway system, and they believe that the solution is found in a small black box that is located in the armature border of each car.
The devices that set up every hot kilometre and report the information to the authorities are the key point of a controversial trial of Washington and the United States planning offices to process the old system for the financing of the United States roads.
Normally, the longer-term area of road planning has suddenly deployed an intensive debate with bound allians.
Liberters have associated themselves with environmental groups and are saying that the Government can use the small boxes to set up the risked kilometres – and perhaps where they were driven – and then use the information for tax collections.
The Tea Party is disappointed.
The Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection coverages.
However, while you are not able to make some of you in the Congress, several countries are not waiting for any more.
You are currently checking how they can change to a system during the next Property years, paying the driver per meal.
Thousands of car vehicles have already tested the drivers of which some have been equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a museum for our country.
“It is nothing we can only use” said Hasan Ikhrata, business leader of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which produces a record of the mile of the dangerous miles in all California carriers in the Federal State since 2025.
The way we make these taxes will change.
The technology is here.
The initiative comes to a time, since the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes, is a pleit for the US Amer in the sample.
However, in America there is no longer so much as before.
Cars consume less gas.
The State mineral oil tax of 18,4 cents per Gallone (not less than 4 eurocents per liter) has been reduced since 20 years.
In high press prices, the tax is not to be able to raise a cent.
“The benzin tax is simply uncomfortable”, so Lee Munnich, a expert for the Minnesota University.
His Federal State has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the long-termly significant alternative," he said.
Office Officers have it as a media-based user tax.
It is not surprised that the idea of the state-based liberals is eligible because the tax has been used for example to affect the conduct of the transportation so that dust and climate-scheduled gases are reduced.
The Californian plans shall set up the system in the development of Property, with which the ambitionated, legally enhanced objectives of the Federal State to achieve climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, president of the House Transport Committee, also stated that he saw the most long-term alternatives in it.
Furthermore, the free consequences of the Reason Foundation are made by the idea to leave the drivers backwarded.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black lock," Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the directives on Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement will also be supported by two former ministers of the Agency who were invited in a report in 2011 to move the Congress into the direction of milk-based appeal.
The United States Senate was approved last year a 90 million of teures pilot project that would include 100,000 cars.
However, the majority of the representative house prevented the advantage and thus reacted to the thoughts of lawyers from rural areas representing people who often have to leave a lot of miles on the road to work or to the city.
Many federal states and large cities are not moved against themselves in this direction.
The most involved is Oregon, currently 5.000 drivers for the largest experiment of the country.
These carriers will soon be cut off the milk carriers instead of the mineral oil tax in the Federal State.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also makes such a thing.
Illinois tests it in restricted measure with Lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, to which the Departments of 17 States of the Federal States belong to the East Coast (a Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) are currently investigating how to introduce the amendments.
The concept is not universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with the devices, car vehicles were skeptics when they thought that the government could follow each of their movements.
"Remembering against the Great Brother and such things were a great problem," Alauddin Khan, leader of the management of the Nevada Presidency Ministry.
People didn't want it.
When the test arrived, Nevada's LU warned on her website: “It would be relatively easy to convert the drivers into a well-speed monitoring device.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, spraying technology infrastructure that would be used in order to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a series of federal states who now look at a challenged technology with which the State can recognize the kilometers that are threatened, but does not win exactly and where.
In order to, like Khan, the public would also be stronger.
The jail after this technology led some authorities to a small startup enterprise called True Million in California.
The company has not originally arrived to help federal States in taxing car vehicles.
Moreover, it was their goal to take feet on a highly efforting market for Kfz's assurances, where the drivers should be stuck on the basis of the risked miles.
However, its tested devices are also interesting in the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded per .
“The people are better ready to share if their speed and positions are not opened,” said Ryan Morrison, business leader of True Milleage.
In some of these public pilots, great errors were made.
There are essentially more intrusive and more intrusive opportunities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment in order to provide a number of choice options.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose at all no devices and shut down a pauses on the basis of the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the State of the Federation.
Other institutions hope to be able to overcome the concept of a disastrous public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, the employee wants to develop a taxation device that also allows parking facilities to pay, a assurance must be paid only for dangerous kilometers, and the speed data of other vehicles can be produced in real time, thanks to their car rental station.
“Autors would be motivated by the additional value of the benefits that the system offers to participate” means in a town planning document.
Some planners, however, ask whether the whole thing about payment per milk is not only a major discharge manager.
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission for San Francisco Bay, the Congress could simply solve the problem of the Bankroten Highway Trust Fund by enhancing fuel taxes.
A suitable single tax or an annual taxation may be established by vehicles with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little benzine, so that they also have a fair share.
"There is no reason for a operation, if an aspirin is sufficient," Randy Rentschler, the leader of the legislation and public issues of the Commission stated.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of car vehicles are concerned about their responsibility and many other things.
Royal field: Small community is wake up
The volunteer firewall has made the test of herbshopping, despite the lack of staff with Bravour.
Only 11 men participated in the exercise.
The Department Commander Hans Camererer had in his exercise to take place the present Feder in the Burgberger Street.
There should be a short closure in the seat.
By the coming burning and smoking development, two people were lost, but one of them was able to reject another call.
Two atmospheres of the war were prepared after the first review of the challenge by Hans Camerers to be made in the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead to free.
The second person needed to be held.
This wasn't so easy, since it was also a hard step to overcome.
The building, a workplace with integrated station for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and also power balls in it.
Moreover, there were electrical machines for wood processing.
The first solution attack was carried out on the tank in the vehicle.
Another leadership was carried out by an overflow hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Now three solution attacks could be made.
In the building, to use, there was a hot roof in the building.
Hans roomer was also to show what is to work with a little staff available in the exercise.
In the serious case, the Royal Country is supported.
The commander was satisfied with the end of the execution.
Release of high schools and companies
On the Country of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, the President Guido Wolf also was able to find out in Titisee-Negt about where the workforces come from tomorrow.
In the promotion of the Hochschwarzwald, he followed together with the business leaders of the professional schools, as well as the circuit gymnasium and the parent officers of this important question.
"The education is a major location factor," underlined the chairman of the Hans-Thoma School, which represented the networked school project Education space High Blackwald.
It showed that Wolf was impressed on the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there is a strict cooperation between the Forderspace, the Circumnation and the Professional School.
He praised family friendship in the country.
"It is important to have not only the family phase in ́k, but also because of the demographic change, the phase for the care of the maintenance of the members," said Wolf.
▪ He suggested that more employees were concerned about the care and maintenance of their members.
"without the support of employees, the burden of employees can lead to an end of work," Wolf said.
But no one can allow it to lose work forces, he continued.
Another, particularly important, is the networking of high schools and companies.
"Therefore those who have already learned the preferences of the region have remained with the ability of the regional economy, which often contributes to the strengthening of the region," the Country Chairman was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training plans were offered, the need for professionals can also be covered.
See Opinion is the benefit of the country circle in the Southwest Germany, directly close to France and Switzerland.
He experienced at his train from Titisee-Ne©gt to Freeburg the already taken efforts for the development of public trafficking.
"Continue to stay hard and make sure that public traffic will be better," he explained the address of the public policies present.
With music learn a sustainable afternoon
From 15 years, the family Kaul has introduced the dieting senior to coffee, kitchen, and then to a vesper.
Before the elderly citizens were conducted in the race.
Meanwhile, this afternoon will find place in the Pflegeheim St. Josef.
The householders enjoyed the beautiful kitchens and tortures.
Later there was a road salat.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and their father, Karl Kimmich.
The old natural steel walls of over 100 years as the previous limitation of the old school head to the church road will be replaced with the sanction cost plan of the city of Braunlingen.
In the days before Kilbig, in the first works of the sanction of the former school head, a small angle wall was built, to stabilize and statistically deployed the old natural stone wall with balustrad.
The next step is to see that Alexander Misok from the Braunling city building, to include the country memory office in the planning and to create a sanction concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost shall be taken by operators, which shall then be put on the table to the Community Index for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision will probably take place in the next year.
After the sanction, flashing and tree-building of the old school head within the two side flights of 1912, a follow-up must be made in a short time as a result, the needed limitation wall of sanitation, as a result of the new building.
The historical, hundred years old delimitation wall of the old school head to the church road, is especially through water and frost shades, since there is no drainage, needs sanction and has a bookening forward.
Deep rise in each stone is of shades of winter, but the wall is currently not united.
A safe wall is a condition for one of the students' school heads, which has been performed by the current firming work.
In fact, school headquarters were planned even in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned issues had a displacement.
A significant word in the history of school walls, which has already been used for movies, will be discussed by the country's opinional office.
If the standards come from this page, the city hopes the bridegroomers to be able to give the thoughts.
The students of the basic school, who are learned again in a well-saneated old school building with new aula, can soon use the old school head.
Özdemir wants Jazza training in Stuttgart
In the debates on the future of the musical schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Green, has now been active.
"I think it's wrong to put the entire education in the Stuttgart school," Ozdemir said the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classics belong to Stuttgart.
This is the contrary to Ozdemir, which is used in Stuttgart as a favourite for a direct candidate at the Bundesday election on 22 September, the Green-Red Government.
This forces on the basis of a expert study a reorder of the five musical schools in Baden Württemberg.
In addition, the accession of Jazz and Pop from the Music Hoch School Stuttgart will be transferred to the Mannheim Music Hoch School.
US Greyscale: "Super tunnel" detected for the shadow
At the border between Mexico and the United States, the investigators have discovered and set up a "super tunnel" for the shopping.
As reported by the US customs members, the length of more than 500 meters between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, trailing glasses and a liquidation facility.
Three contemporaries were then arrested, eight tons of Marihuana and almost 150 kg of cocain.
The tunnel was not yet used according to the information.
"These cards are stupid if they think they could go through under the radar," said the General State Advocate of the Southern California Southern Southern District, Laura Duffy, at a press conference before a storage house in San Diego, where it was discovered an end of the tunnel.
"If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we have decided to make it to make a big deterioration of your money."
As the US and the Mexico security forces are in a long-term fight against the cards.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people were killed in Mexico in relation to crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the exhibition of the tunnel, the investigators determine that it was built by architects and engineers and that the building was approximately approximately one year.
The glass device was so equipped that electrically driven cars could be used there.
On the Mexico side, access is in a building that is 80 metres away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader of 20 meters leads to the depth of the tunnleang.
The tunnel has an average of 1,20 metres height and 90 centimeter width.
It would also be appropriate to promote the illegal immigration in the United States.
Two of the convictors were adopted in relation to the cocain fund.
The third, a mexican, was deceived because of the deceased Marihuana.
All three are the highest penalty of lifetime freedom, as the employee said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels were discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time it was found in such a tunnel building cocain.
Normally, the cocain is shaking in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
This shows the "deviation" of the bands between which traditional rounds are separated, Bill Sherman said from the DEA capture in San Diego.
They'd do everything to get into the United States.
No details were given to the arrested, at least one is Mexico, it was called.
You have to be counted with prison penalties until age.
2014 will be the Geisinger Festival Year
The jubileum of the city of Geisingen at the end of the 1250.
Again, the first urnal creation is always closer.
When the year ends in eight weeks, the Jubilee Year is on.
The church houses and church houses were first invoked together 794 times.
In Churchs, there was an orchard in which both places were inherited.
On the 15th March there will be an official record for the Jubilee Year, and since there is no holiday, this recording event will be located in the place where both of them were born first 1250 years ago, in church houses.
In the context of the Jubilea, some events are planned both in geising and in church houses.
Church Houses will be held at a festival of 18 to 20 July on 1250 in July.
Again celebrate.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church Halls.
This Festive Week is also the Church-Hausen's festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written for the city an assignment composite that is listed at three terms.
On June 21, with the sun-water festival of the Black Wald Conference, on 12 July in the Arena with firework and 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival.
This will be completed in Jubilee and shown that the official date is the last week of September, 27 and 28 September.
According to the Geisinger City Jubilea, there is also a new history.
"But it should be a cronik not only of gissings himself, but a printed work on the gates of today, which is also from gears, church houses, leipherdings, olfings and goodmadings," so citizen Walter Hengstler.
And even today's celebration feasts 2014 Birthday, 1974 the present space was complete with the meetings.
The new history will then be presented in the new festivals on 21 or 22 November.
But 2014 is another year with many jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on February 8, with a breakfast night at its 60-year-old existence, the Harmonie Gutmadings will be 90 years and has the festivity banknet on 29 March and then celebrates the circuit music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The old work Leipferdings is 40 years old, the school is 50 years old at the new place and celebrates this on 10 May, the Music Veren Polyhymnia Leipferdings will be 150 years old and celebrates this within the Future Festival of 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was born in an hour of wedding, which is in the owner of the Closter of St. Gallen, first in 764.
The urkundes were certified in churches (house) that was the court place at that time.
Both communities have therefore been subjected to the same urgency.
The reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old, the common reform is still 40 years old.
The Council takes glass devices in the visa
Whether the travel transition "Am Hirschen" should be converted to increase security
Yes, the community devices have been locked.
It must take 220 000 euros in hand.
The German Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal baselines in the next year.
In order to increase the safety of travel transactions - it is regularly to collection of movements with other vehicles.
When the Communities vote on the restructuring measures, they have to share with a third party in the costs that share the trains and the bonds.
Schiltach's city treeman Roland Grießhaber presented to the community the requirements of the "Am Hirschen".
There the town is to build an exhibition in the west of the bathroom.
There may also be greater vehicles, for example such as transporting the long wood, in the contrary, without having to block the glass.
Highhaber therefore proposed to construct a needed support wall so that the city could expand the road at the time given to ensure an unrequired fluid.
This was discussed in the community conflicters, since some rates have the need for a road spread in doubt: Thomas Kipp with his statement the vote of the criticians on the point: "Will we take in hand so much money for so few vehicles?"
Citizen Thomas Haas opposed: The transition "Hirschen" will be regularly sufficient for long-tree transport.
Even a tree from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported over these streams because the vehicles could not use the streams on the haverlesbrücke because they could not run into the main road.
Furthermore, the streams serve as a transportation for vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is locked, have argumented Haas.
Since there is no doubt that Kirchberg and Slossberg tunnel should be converted and sanated, as this is currently in Wolfs the case, the transition "Am "Hirschen" can also have a significant significance for a longer period.
The rats agreed to examine what costs would cause the expansion of the road.
Instead of this, the construction of the travel transition was mostly agreed with the measure that the needed support wall is built so that the city can build the next road "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic at approximately 5,5 metres.
However, the construction of the travel transition by the Gerberia grauty wine could cause a whole other problem that involves the movement in the strong growing "Geroltz House Road".
The administration had allowed the rebuilding plans of the train from the Engineer Breinlinger, because it had doubts of whether the planned accession of the Jeroltz House was still possible.
The investigation resulted that it was not to be excluded that the conditions of the street could lead to longer vehicles.
The responsibility of this is the city again as a road loader.
The construction can therefore follow the detentions.
Since both the housing and the decline in the current building state worked, we should not agree with the construction of the travel transition, Haas argumented.
In this case, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is clearly less than the other travel transactions because it is directly in the middle of the holding point to which a viewing link is available.
Even moves from the head of the highway should have been breaked in this place so much that no collision is worried.
In most cases, the construction of this travel transition was refused to agree, since the city Schiltach has to "build out" the problem with the opposing vehicles, so the routes that the trains can be removed from the responsibility after the construction works.
As unproblematic, the Gremium considers the constructions to the travel transitions "For Heubach" and "For Kuhbach", for which already have been met cross agreements with the train.
It decides about large world space missions: missions for billion
Remote planets, gravitation villages or black layers - Experts of the room travel journal now need to be on two large projects that they want to start in the next years.
30 proposals were to choose, five are still in the run.
Remote worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomes.
No one knows whether there is at least some of these lives.
The selection is hard: Should you search for grevitation sources?
Or do you like to investigate the origin of the Cosmos?
Or would it be possible for the earthly planets to discover external life?
These questions are just the responsibles of the Esa Road Traveling Taxes.
For their Cosmic Vision program, they are looking for ideas for two large space carrying projects to make research decisions.
The status for such "L-missions" is about a billion euros.
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034.
In the beginning of September, the Elite of the World Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 The ideas were discussed, and five of them now have come into the worst choice.
Many institutions appreciate the proposals, following the researchers.
In the next days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, four major questions have chosen the Esa to find responses to the missions of the 2007 initiated Cosmic Vision.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise operations in the creation of stars from big gas clouds - and thus the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the speaking darkness.
A big infraroot telescope in all could pass through this darkness.
And if a star planet, under what circumstances can life occur?
To follow this question, the world space telescope "Cheops" will be started in 2017, with the 500 existing planet systems in our nearest environment.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With greater instruments, the astronomes could imagine earthly planets and even analyze the composition of their atmosphere and so search for "biomarkers": gases that apply as an index for biological A.
How does the sun system work?
In addition, this question is to be able to conclude what conditions there are for the resurrected life.
A important role plays the magnetic A° of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the radiation of parts from it with the planet system.
In our sun system, these operations can be examined exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter" Esa has already approved a mission of the M-class (which is the budget at about half billion euros) for this question.
The sun will start 2017 and watch the top area and the sun's A.
From great interest for researchers are also Jupiter and his moon.
You want to find out what role the Rice Planet has played in the development of the sun system.
That is why Esa is the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The Sunday "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) starts their travel 2022 probably.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and will examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the demanded Monde Europe, Callisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The world all offers many opportunities to study material under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural law still applies to us.
There may also be differences that can show the way to a new theory, under which all natural laws are united.
How has the universe become and what is there?
13,7 billion years ago, our cosmos came through the urknall.
Besides our practical material, from the stars, planets and lives as we are, there are dark materials, with their height of galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy through which the extent of the world is clear.
Even so, the researchers do not know what physical laws in the first second breaks of the urknall were valid, neither are the dark material and dark energy.
With "EA member" the Esa has already allowed here a M mission which has been scheduled to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the sun will first examine the distribution of materials in the universe in the entire heaven and allow such reclusions to create dark material and dark energy.
Who could make the run
From the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the election procedure.
The best chances for a license as L-mission have, according to many experts "E-Lisa", an approximate concept for the evidence of gravitations.
In addition, physician changes are understood in the structural of the room, which Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They were not pronounced until today.
Elisa could make it, hope the economics behind the project.
The mission provides one of two or three song detector, which is at all stationed.
On the contrary to plants on earth, he could also prove gravitation sources that have occurred at the urknall and provide new knowledge about the coming of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competiting on the second L mission: a large Röntgentelescope named "Athena", which will investigate, including black layers, "Icy Planets", another mission to the external planets of the sun system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmical background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will investigate and investigate the earthly planets.
In addition, proposals for test-rock transport from Mars, for the research of Mond, Venus and Asteroids and for the sun physics are present.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to US monitoring
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US Secret Service, explained that he is ready to travel to Berlin and state before the German Bundesday when the National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not give answers to their A.
The German Deputy Hans-Christian Strobele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum was received to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter of Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Strebels, he writes: “Although the result of my efforts was evidently positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a faithful breakfast and trys to criminalize a political opinion with straf-instruction, where there is no defence possible.”
The truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the Government of the Ananias to leave the accusation against him.
The accusations raised by the US Justice Minister included spionage and debt of State property.
The German Internal Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: “If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, then we find ways to enable it.”
The relationships between the United States and Germany are charged by the controls that the NSA has listened to the phone by Kanzler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the lawyer, who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, explained that it was to take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a Witness, if it is possible, "without put it up and destroy the relationships with the United States."
Strobele, a lawyer of the Green, published a picture of himself and Snowden in Twitter Feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists in Russia.
Strebele explained that the lawyer of the former NSA partner Snowden cannot return to Russia when he leaves the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, then he needs a guarantee that he is "certain" there, as the lawyer.
Snowden explains in a letter that he seems to be a "prestigious and continuing" persecution campaign that has destroyed him from his home.
However, he has been touched by the world's reaction to 'My Act of Political Expression'.
Citizens around the world and high-range members, including in the United States, have undertaken enthusiasms on an uncontrolled system of supervision as a general service.
In a letter, Snowden makes the German authorities a boat of cooperation, “if the difficulties around humanitarian situation have been resolved”.

Frontier Airlines plant to request up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to hold on their flight handpackets.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of handpackets and 2⁄ for coffee or limonade, even if in the middle-week announcement it was to read that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new payment applies to handpackets in the packet over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated when the taxes were paid before, and 100 US dollars in travelers who first paid the flight.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the taxes of $100 are going to move travelers to care for payment.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Aeroplane companies began 2008 to request the first and second packaging taxes given.
Therefore, passengers who try to handle them have stopped as much as possible in the pack, which results that the packages are often overflowed over the seat.
The taxes are a possibility to move passengers to take less with board.
O'Malley said the new tax isn't really going to deserve money.
It's about the most reliable clients of frontiers that would have clearly expressed that it would always be more difficult to find space in the office over the seat.
Passeers who buy your tickets on the airport site do not pay.
This means that a passenger at the flight of frontiers may be able to take a packaging without cost, but the next person must pay for a comparable packet.
O'Malley explained that the frontier web site and check-in procedures would be changed, so the passengers were informed about the taxes before they came to the flight.
The new hand packaging of Frontier only enters into force in summer, a exact date is not yet available.
The passengers often broke on packaging and other taxes, but aircraft companies want to go back to it.
They argue that the transport of the package should cost money and pay this service passengers if they want it.
At Wall Street the new packaging taxes are considered as a sign that the flight companies take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
However, most of them leave the fingers of taxes for handpackets.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested three years ago as the first payment for handpackets and later followed the Allegiant Air, also a bilingue.
The only other flight company with such a tax is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the Airline Brother Jay Sorensen, who carefully follows the additional taxes.
He appreciated in a report from December 2011 that the handpacking spirit would introduce 50 million dollars annually.
Sorensen, which had a leader position at Midwest Airlines, was recently with spiritologists and was aware of what would expect him at the flight stage if passengers were confronted with the unusual handpacking of the company.
“The Boarding process belonged to the losses I have learned in my carrier in the airway,” he said.
I expected to see teethic and manuscript discussions on the floor.
"The flight was filled," he explained, "and the boarding went as smiled."
Frontier is also followed by Spirit at the 2° requested for coffee, tea, limonade or saft.
The company explained that passengers, buying the limonade or saft, the whole dose should be maintained and coffee will be postponed freely.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently requested 2008 to request money for refreshment rents, but this restored seven months later after passengers had been charged and no other large company was followed.
Frontier's step to highlight taxes for the handpack if passengers do not buy directly with the flight company is the youngest initiative that customers should be trained to their own website.
Aeroplanes pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per acquired ticket.
This provides all companies an incentive to move passengers to their direct coastal place over a online journey office.
Frontier, however, has gone the most difficult in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive just a half of so many meals in the booking of a online journey office.
In the middle of the mile, the miles were recurring to 25% of the flight string.
A flight booked at a third-party provider with a frontier over 1000 miles will therefore bring customers only 250 miles.
Passeers can also reserve from direct cup on the frontier site.
Frontier is over a faithful customer tribe in Denver, but the business is broken and the company loses money.
The redemption returned about 9 Pro, and the aircapacity smoked almost 13 Pro in the first quarter, as it was read in the financial report, published at the middle-week of the Republic of Airways Holdings Inc..
The Republic has attempted to get the funds of frontiers in the framework of the company's sale.
Words From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the latest women in this year in the evangelical church community Bisingen.
The subject of the day in the community house was "Speakwords from the Bible" and "References from the Mediterranean".
Zita Köhler, president of the Church-Community Council, entered in a statement to the Bible speakers after the morning.
"The word contains life sciences, rules or warnings," she explained.
She compared several speech words with the appropriate Bible texts and explained the importance.
She called speech words such as: The woods be watchful, how the trumpets fall from the eyes, cast a eyes on someone, who gives the Lord in sleep, cut off his hands in innocentness.
Sometimes the referencer also advised her listeners to what language it was.
The talks from the Mediterranean took place the church community of Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, covered something.
She explained the importance and origin of the speaking applications she called "break in the past".
Until the end, a tombol was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorally converted before they were transferred to the winners.
Under the springs of the early round, Roman Waizenegger also mixed citizen candidat.
Learn place unemployment: pilot project for students in tourism
On the Mecklenburg Seaplate, a pilot project started for the tourism industry.
Subject to the Federal Work Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unleavened in the branch will be qualified over three winters to experts for hotels and guests.
"Now it is that the six-month courses end with discharges," Carmen Wiechert said from the Newbrandenburg Work Agency.
The benefit is much: The participants would not be working without work, the companies would fight educational scientists who were always more stronger in hotels and guests, and the Agency should not finance unemployment.
The project also shares the industry and trade rooms in Neubrandenburg, as well as the German hotel and hostage association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg Prepommers.
NSA explains a "internal error" and not a hacker's guilty on the website
The Danish National Security Agency explained at the late Friday, an error laughed her public website a few hours and not a hacker, as it was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, since during a planned update an internal error occurred,” the spionage agency reported in a message sent by email.
The problem will be raised this evening.
The claim that the accident has been caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online tractors observed that the NSA web site was not available for at least six hours and that is not yet available for some users.
A NSA speaker had previously explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was compromised “in no way”.
The secret information is not inside, as the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists took advantage of the NSA website with a DDOS attack.
In such attacks, the target site will be overflowed with calls until the servers are overloaded and the web site will be gathered.
Cybertactic is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter into the internal network of the target system.
The former super secret NSA, whose name was one of No Search Agency (no such authority) was located in the light of the public and looked at the enthries made in the past months on its extensive monitoring programme in the lower criticism of the in- and outland, a result of the secret NSA data, which was stuck and published by the former NSA interoperable Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy on the secret service confirmed the initial speculate of the fact that the interval today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation.
Easy sunked is the number of people without job in October 22 to 1.307.
If the quota is better than the last year and even better than in September, "We would have hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, the representative of business officers of the Agency for Work in Sunday.
For many operations have been responsible for setting up.
One reason for this is that the fielder-bauer says: "We have no experts in the handwork, health and old manager."
Annual period of time has also been offered to staff in hotels and guests from September.
Middle December, the winter season begins.
The entire background report will be found in the general display magazine of 31.10.2013 (Page 33).
winning income in bombs after reduction in delivery payments and tasks
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent reduction in net winning after he was made under pressure by repeated orders and supplies in flights in the quarter and contracting problems in the railway party.
Bombardier with Sitz in Montreal also published no flight tests for his new CSeries aircraft and provided no new information about whether the flight could go into commercial use in accordance with the respective time plan in September next.
The young flight of the test aircraft for a half months ago followed only three other starts, which may appear askingly whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the prognoses and led to a course of more than eight proÃ ̈ on the top of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, Anal holding National Bank Financial, sent its assessment of "outperform" on Thursday to "sector perform" as regards the action in the next one to two quarters a limited cursing potential.
"When weak delivery numbers were expected largely in aircrafts, but we are clearly dismissed from the development of the margins in the transport area," Dorksen said in a customer writing.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test programme for the aircraft progresses.
However, if there are no new orders given in the coming months, we expect the market to be more skeptic to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries' airlines can catapult the company in the underground market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented in the public market and fled after monthly delays first in September.
However, until now the CSeries' commitments have been moderated, since potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's controls relating to the driving plant and the cost-in-cost capacity of the new driving aircraft are relevant.
Currently, there are 403 orders and orders from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin believes that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the Jet.
The management of the enterprise was also assured on Thursday to analysts and media that the programme was in the term plan.
“The test aircraft is not longer stayed on the ground than expected,” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and fÃe, while the airport was used by bodenests and software updates.
Each manufacturer plants different.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, which we have done.
This happens during the whole flight program.
The second of five test aircraft will probably be started in the next weeks, the remaining shortly after it was called undertaking site.
However, analysts remain skeptic if twelve months after the first client's first flight a CSeries aircraft can be operated.
Bombardier explained that it checks the implementation plan (EIS) and will update them in the next months.
"The slow advances of the flight test – even if they obviously correspond to the internal planning of Bombardiers – strengthens our view that the introduction to the first quarter of 2015 is different," said Dorksen.
In the quarter end of September 30, the net winning of Bomberdier was 147 million, or 8 cent per action of 172 million, or 9 cent per action in the year before.
The adjusted winning per action is unchanged 9 cents.
The scope was lowly followed and was from 4.2 to 4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a winning of 10 cents per action and a conversion of 4,56 billion, thus Thomson Re日s I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer worldwide indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircrafts to 26.
On 30 September, 32.9 billion was assigned to the air and space travel party and was not changed against 31 December.
"In the area of air and space transport, the results of our standards have been made, but the low income and market conditions were disturbing," Beaudoin said.
The transmission in the air and space travel party fell about 13% to two billion.
Bombardier, the worldwide largest railway manufacturer, gave that the turnover in this park was about about 11 Pro a 2.5 billion.
On 30 September, it was 32.6 billion and was easily increased against 31 December.
The profits in the transport area were affected by developing problems in some large contracts.
The management of the business will provide new standards for the fourth quarter.
In the afterday trade on Thursday, the bombbardier action followed 8,5 Pro日 and was at 4,83 Canadians, after it was also announced that the Google Financial Representative Patrick Pichette will be changed in the presence.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the worldwide biggest commercial aircraft producer and bombs, reported on Thursday a decreasing reduction of the quarter profit.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport

The LAX airport of Los Angeles is a largest airport in the United States.
Cocain dependent lawyer who warned the boss of police investigation must be in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information on underground size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer had had, and his secret dependence could come to light
He was condemned by the Liverpooler Crown Court to three years of prison
A criminal defendant who warned a baron before a great police investigation because he had been able to discover his secret search was condemned for three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underground size Neil Scarborough with sensible information on investigations to its Assets in the trade after it was compromised by his own cocaine insight.
The awarded by criminals as a "primary" lawyer with the name "Bash" was arrested in 2011 after the police Scarborough had monitored, which he had represented in a previous procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) three cocaine cocain at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, La ́shire, delivered, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer's room.
The investigations agreed that Ditta regularly consumed the class A after found in the tests of cocain in his hair, on his letter box and on credit cards.
In a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he requested unlimited information about the arrest of two men in Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four convictors were at that time monitored by the police in a large investigation procedure for the trade of heroin and cocaine in La ́casire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 other persons, they were arrested later after the police in a series of home investigations of heroin and cocaine in value of 1,5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of money.
Ditta, 42, gave further information to the criminals because he feared that his dependence could be public.
Today, it was Ditta, who was found and condemned at the Liverpooler Crown Court for the Forbes Office in Blackburn, following a three-week procedure in two trial points for the prevention of the justice.
In a previous question, he granted the owner of cocain.
The lawyer was transferred after the police in its investigations against Scarborough found that he had been regularly contacted with Dinta in February 2011.
Two investigation officers followed the contemporary and saw how he went to Ditta house and there the village with a cleanness of 60% in a black golf handshot under the tone of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered it, Scarborough regularly phoned with Ditta, who was at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers station in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took up the face, and then nine communications were exchanged between both.
It was judged that Ditta was a “regular consumption” of Kokain after the tests of class A were discovered in his hair, his letter box and on his credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but he refused to take a cocain and said he spoke to the mute dealer because he was his man, and said that their discussion was under the “the secret of the advocate”.
During his arrest, Ditta took his letter table and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were assured and he was taken a hair test.
When he was a police audience, he suggested that he had a office and man's office in both his address and at the workplace would call him home because of legal matters.
In the case of the Court, he called the important operators of the trade trade, of which he had previously represented some, after significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them.
State advocate Anne Koete said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than all others that we do not violate the law."
Ditta is accused of the misuse of his position as a criminal defendant, because he has committed himself too much with certain men.
The questionary relationship is not simply the employer, but the employer who provides his lawyer with.
A part of his communications was uncertainly legitimate because he was the advocate of these people.
However, this was far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between a lawyer and Man.
He effected the police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to follow their crimes.
This is why Mr Dyta has been a professional stage in a vocational manner.
He was too close to certain men, especially Scarborough, and he allowed it to compromise his independence.
Ditta showed every misbehavior and said: “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I was not, and I wanted to send information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but soon.”
However, after the consultation, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lałaśire said: “Mr. Ditta has made the step from a criminal defendant to a criminal at the time he began to buy an organized crime.”
His cocain dependence led to an unexpected compromise and made it capable of the motive of the leaders of the organized crime, which ordered him to collect valuable information on police investigations.
Recommendations must maintain the maximum standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has left this confidence and has tried to disturb himself behind the fashion of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Laõashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocain and justice abuse, which stresses our deceit to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning for criminals and show that no one can remove from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was condemned to 14 years of prison after he explained the denunciation of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Fifty more persons shared in trade were condemned to a total penalty of 153 years because of delegates.
On his website, Ditta published a field with questions and answers about himself, where he said, his dream job is to represent a lawyer Man ́en in the death cell in America, his ultimative guest at the evening is Mohammed Ali and the opportunity of equality is the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations of his 160 - year - old existence, the Lièkranz Dunningen will carry out two divine services with the "German Mese" of Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the Musical "Rock my Life", which the surveyers enjoyed in the early year of this year, the Liekranz will extend to the end of the Jubilee Year two gods with the establishment of the German Messe of Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26 October, this exceptional mess will be heard from 19 during the evening middle of St. Martinuskirch Dunningen and Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 hours at the service of God in St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The German Mese as such as referred to in the original title "Gesange to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the Mese", D 872, is a spiritual music work of the composite Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of the resurrection.
The Measure is recorded in the divine service, as the missionary John Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Sneider, the Chor is accompanied by the broker group of the Music Conference of Frohsinn teeth source and Noemi Lokodi.
Haslach: Skepsia Weight Severe confidence
For example, with the elections to the farmer-generate 2015, Haslach (SE) will change the basic.
Then there is only a common farmer-generate for all six pairs.
At a joint meeting, the enterprises of Haslach, Courts, Mühlenbach, Fisherbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach were prepared for the changes on Saturday.
Because in the basic decisions of the dioseza there is nothing to be changed and it is possible to implement it as satisfyingly.
During the day, it was particularly clear that the scepsia against the new weight was weakening but, obviously, a confidence.
From the views and expectations of the news 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the farmer-generation, the extremely active talk of the six-greme with the main officers of the Seas-orge team.
Regional Dekan Georg Schmitt presented the newest guidelines for Seelsorge units in the Erzdiose Freeburg on a presentation.
The SE Haslach as a church community will then be a body of the public law, which is in line with the rights and obligations of six individual church communities.
There will be only one common farmers and a establishment Council in which the Pfarrer's power is representative of the Office.
At least two selected members shall be representatives of each pharmaceutical staff in which six pairs are designed before the place as mentioned.
Your task will be future to promote the church life in the place.
The question of the financials of individual farmers has then shown a significant need for talking.
The newspapers suggest that collected goods remain in the pharmacies.
However, the commitments are over to the general community.
As regards the largely planned investment, their commitment to all pairs then, there were great thoughts.
"And in the past, it was only invested in projects that could be controlled by individual pharmaceuticals only," related Haslach's relative president of the Pfarrge-General Bruno Princebach.
Practical experience with a common body for five pieces, Barbar Ritter, president of the Gremi in the Shutterwald New Unit.
They made themselves to the 2006 task, "One becomes, stay five" and they had to find that it wasn't so easy.
The institutions of the Haslaker Seelsorge Unit were then to answer the issues on the future composition and size of the common farmers and the practical work of the Community teams.
The developments will be concretized at further meetings and have been held at a further joint meeting of all six institutions in the next early year.
At the end, the Pfarrgenerator Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was accepted with clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity will be thrown
The citizens of Pfullendorfs must be set up on the powers.
As the business leader of the town works, Jörg-Arne Bias, against the southKURIER, increases to a four buying pollendorfer family 70 to 90 Euro More per year.
A key reason for the existing price increase is the growth of the so-called EEC environment of 5,277 to 6,3 cent per kilowatt hour.
This environment will be re-determined each year by the four operators of the large power traces.
These are the majority of the energy cycles that can be highlighted by a replacement of the energy price.
The town works Pfullendorf are the last member of this kitchen.
The Energy Undertaking Supervisory Board was even out of an environmental environment, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete claims should be calculated before the town works can inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going out of a highlight of 1 cent plus x," so bias, where the number is going to lie close to the 2 cents.
Ample on a long road: wait for a waiting time
Sometimes a ample just won't be green.
The contact slider in the street doesn't respond, or the light mark is defect.
What are you going to do, then, to walk in the red?
If an employee has waited long enough on a red ample and the cross is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart legal lawyer Ralf Becker in the "Motorrad".
The waiting time, however, must be "measured" which may be expressed differently if case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before you get out of a functional stage of the ample.
But whoever continues to travel against red lights, it must be clear that he has the full fault for a caused accident.
Whoever endures less than five minutes is not long enough in circumstances, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Court of Justice.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the ample after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a driving raw light.
The ample was not defect, but shot a little later to green.
A carrier prohibited him because of the special situation, but not the money penalty.
Communities enjoy solid households
When it comes to the household meetings, the citizen Ralph Gerster has a good smile.
The community in Herdwagen Schönach has been well-aware and the administration has no longer known since 2005.
Moreover, the 2012 budget can be recorded as a full success in this regard.
This was clear in 2012's presentation of the year.
As Andrea Rothmund said, the administrative budget of approximately 7,6 million euros was estimated as planned.
Moreover, the overview of the administrative budget is about 1,8 million euros over the approximately one million euros.
In particular, the exemption of tax income and the share of the Community in the income tax shall be thanked.
In addition, the budget was clearly clear over the planned values.
Instead of the estimated 1,5 million euros, it was 2,5 million euros in the past year.
"This is essentially the adoption of the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
Since less investments were made than planned in the 2012 budget, the recovery was also found.
In total, about 2,1 million euros could be increased in the total of 4,9 million euros.
Master Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the work.
"How a work you don't just shoot out of the brain," louded Gerster with a cut on the year.
He and the communities were obviously glad of the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but exactly these good numbers could be made to the citizens quickly.
By means of the Financial Law, the community in the past was able to dismiss high levels of hazards.
This means, however, that Gerster has already been cut off from the country.
For these contributions from various compensations, there are conditions.
In addition, the towns and communities, which are devoted to payments, must provide certain heavy rules.
"The theme of the hae-lines we need to look at, since in the coming years investments for which we wish to have advantages," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in Chor
With 60 years as a song, Hubert Wermter's story at the man's song of Cäcilia is almost double as long as the Herb Festus in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter was as habitual in the colors of his man's anxiety on the bowl.
Even after 60 years, the song with the loved Chor still makes him great pleasure.
The Wermter was also active, including 28 years of age as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and his deal, he received a number of exhibitions: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Reporter in the Cácilian Conference of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, delivered him - because the Chor is also a churchchchor - a urgency of the defense and one of Bischof Gehavd Prince under a letter of honor.
His songing colleagues delivered him the urkundes of the German crorverband and a graved cinter.
Besides the honor, the 31. herbst fest remained inhabited trains: With the MGV Betra, the Li≤kranz saltstetten, the song office and the local music association, the full-margins had a large mixture of different hearing and angle styles which had about 400 sugars.
The MGV fullmaringen opened with voting songs such as "In the wine Paradise" and "Lustig, your brothers".
Their honouring song Hubert Wermter prepared them to honor a little bit - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The man's singing Betra also sang classic chorries like "year buyers" by Julius Wengert, "White, far away" from Hubert Goisern and the peoples' song "When you go through the valley".
The Lieukranz salt stetten provided with mixed Chor and his female group - the "Impulschor" for the feast rates of women.
The mixed Chor, with the neapolitan peoples of "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, also the "Impulschor" came back to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The song office of the Baisinger Sport Conference came with "What's the Swob?" from Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papper's "Bierlied" back to homes, where the full-maring music conference bought the cruel musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small neighborhood program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer brought up a Casperltheater and read a few stories that the children were working on the midnight.
Children's spaces are true
Children's gardens and children's daily posts are received in these days Post.
The Black Walk Boat wants the institutions in collaboration with the building and the Sparkasse Zollernalb in the realisation of their construction and degradation desires.
Is the child garden needing a new sand box?

If you have a construction or injury desire for your installation, you can request this in the Black Walk Boat.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action of the child garden building.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Wales Boat, Bathout and Sparkasse Zollernalb, chooses three wishes from all sentences.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be performed with building material in the value of maximum 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
Moreover, the winner himself must take care of many flexible builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered in the children's garden on the agreed day and then shall be directed by the helpers.

Kenian pressure over the contrary media law
"We are in a terrible situation, and we should ask ourselves: what does the Parliament delay to simply deduce the judicial independence tomorrow?", was reading in the magazine that keeps the draft law not constitutional.
"The law is dramatic and very punishable and we refuse it," Cyrus Kamau, business manager of the Capital Group, who also belongs to CapitalFM, said one of the most independent radioists and news sites Kenias.
He said that the new media digital “we will always be agreed because it is a extended arm of the government” and restrictions on content and publicity would prevent Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President listens to us and we call on him to reject this legislative draft and to return to Parliament," he said.
According to the magazine The Star, the Government takes the new law “the media effectively in a disruption”. The Standard, democracy and freedom in Kenia would have suffered“ a severe shock” and named the design as “draconic”.
The derogation of the law consists of a number of measures to strengthen national security in the light of the attacks by armed islamists on the westgate index in September.
The Chinese media are the wrath of the authorities because they published the records of security cameras to see how the units sent to the Tatort, according to the luxurous acquisition.
The police officer David Kimiyo reacted to hearing with the establishment of two journalists and a leading media provider, even if the layout was returned after a revocation of the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Chinese shillings and individual journalists with up to a million and the other risk of losing their famous recognition or excluding an official press-accreditation.

One, which includes for revenge and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
As Dejà Vu, a psychological phenomenon is called Lexikon, which is expressed in the feeling that a new situation has already occurred or has been seen.
In the case of the coffee's coffee on the box in the Cruzstadt Kleve in viewway to the High School of Rhein-Wal, it must not remain at the clean Déjà Vu-Gefühl.
The café with the beautiful name has exactly this to go: a real stay not only thankful, but always make it experienced again.
Because it makes it fun and it's just beautiful.
A cock in the internal life in the opposition 8 gives the viewer Anhieb a feeling.

Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a pronounced fan of events evening: "You can't do it right now."
And with one event, I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception of us.
"We want the whole normal operation as less as possible."

UN announced new goals in poverty control
The United Nations starts immediately with the development of a number of new goals, with which the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty are to be replaced before 12 years.
In the context of the UN's sustainable development box, which started in Rio de Janeiro on the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the “dual development goals” to replace the Millennium objectives in 2015.
They were included in the final projects of the document, which will be rejected by worldpolitical leaders, Mrs Gillard.
The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon explained at evening on the board that the time was come to “remember the national interests”.
"I am glad that Member States have agreed to take an attack on a process to be agreed with the universal, sustainable development objectives," he said.
“These objectives will develop our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral component of the framework work for development after 2015.
I will not strive to implement this mandate given by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that develop the success of the Millennium goals."

Therefore, they will certainly be very particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is to be expected if there is still strength from the first," explains the SG coach.
The Malmon team must be increased in comparison with the past occurrences.
In front of all things in the decking work and on the switch game, it was recently heappered.
Moreover, the possibilities are to be improved.
So I hope that my players have finally got the head free during the short pause.
Safety thoughts in Mosambik increased in the light of coincidences between influenced personalities
Thousands of people gathered themselves in the centre of Maputos under the growing eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and the first president of Mosambik, to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," Vanessa de Sousa said, business leader of a investment undertaking.
In addition to the future of the country, she has changed her business clothing against a T-shirt with the entry "We request security" in Portuguese and joined it on Thursday on the main city's independence.
Since two weeks, there are nearly daily reports on cohesions between government forces and Renamo, which are the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a reasonable revolt movement, which, at first, was supported by the Rhodesia governed by white and later the South African Apartment Government, in efforts to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the peace contract of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that the country returns to a grown conflict, but the youngest events of foreign investors and domestics have disturbed.
For the quick growing economy is a lot on the game, because the discovery of great gas advances before the coast and coal campaign in the northwest could bring in the next years investments from over 50 billion US dollars of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The regional Frelimo Party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo gives one another the charge for the spending.
Renamo claims that the government has caused the latest meetings by attacking her members in the region of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The crimes on the former rebels were scaled when government groups attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos Sprechers against the Financial Times.
The Government gives Renamo the debt for the meetings and accuses the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has been trying to think about an instability.
In contrast to AFP, the French news agency, he said at middle-week that Dhlakama viewed himself as a loser, who wanted to use all its remaining powers to prove that he could force the Government to make his decisions.
As far as Frelimo and Renamo show that they want to avoid a war.
However, the thoughts have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo has adopted the peace agreement of 1992.
In contrast to the FT, he explained that Frelimo does not respect the agreement anymore.
"Our vision is to restart negotiations, even though serious," said Mazanga.
Previous interviews between the parties have only been able to introduce the spending held by a series of meetings in this year.
“We have two raised men (Guebusa and Dhlakama) here, who gathered the heads together,” says Joseph Hanlon, Do日 at the open and Mosambic experts.
No one of them is good in negotiation and no one is ready to make the necessary opportunities.
Renamo, who has been binding on election reforms, has already explained that she will boycott the communal elections in November.
Presidency and Parliament's elections have been planned for the next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the temptation of a disturbing movement to affect the government's consents and financial benefits.
Renamos's choice has been smoked since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo-Mitglied Movimento Democratica de Mozambique (MDM), will probably improve the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza, when its second official time ends in the next year, wants to break the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multipartial democracy, he doesn't want transparency choices, he does not want peace because he does not want the President's name," said Mazanga.
It is unclearly about what Renamo's capacity is, but she has an improving attack on policeist and vehicles on a major north-south connections.
Most of the battles found in the province of Sofala, some hundred miles north of Maputo, but Beira, the town, the mountain buildings such as Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export cold.
In June, Rio took the use of the railways for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the streets.
Mazanga replied continuously to the question whether Renamo will repeat this trial.
Renamo wanted “the international community to warn that the things in Mosambik are not good,” said Mazanga.
The instability has still increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, leader of Mediacoop, a independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the slightest progress in development and a recent relief source.
"The people think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions for the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
"No one's interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful roads again," he explained.
Children should learn myths and legends as “examples for life”, a author.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal power has no chance against Claire Tricks” and the Artus Legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, the myths are “too wild, too anxious and in some cases to be learned at schools, ” so Crossley-Holland planned for an “inquired choice” of older works.
"I feel wonderful that mythen and peoplelore are already part of education in America," he said.
I've proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He added, by authors and teachers who were "too dictative", children would "deactivately" because in sustainable stories the messages would be "undersighted".
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Angelsaqsian and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British People Tales, explained: "You can follow certain views, but you should keep them in the background."
Maybe the greatest distinction between an adult author who writes for a adult, and a author who writes for children is needed to provide hope.
Not all must be simplified or lead to Happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subsequently presented, not explained by the story.
This is the old story of the show instead of talking.
Hansjakob goes again to freehof
Hundred years ago Heinrich Hansjakob had his age in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were lived in "Freehof".

With their song "O Jesuslein" they enjoyed the public in the freehouse as well as the magazines with their words "Heraus, Herause".
His criticism at the office of the Office had at the same time expressed his view of agricultural growth, the impact of industrialization or the impact of the war.
In the home territory, behind his grave capsule on the burning at the hofstocks, he found his rests.
"A unfortunate spirit had finally found his rest and was gone home forever," it called at the end of the scene game.
Applause and many praising words were from the public for the introduction.

When each movement of the enveloped devices kills a wide warning exchange over the area.
"The signals serve the security and are legally written," says Matthias Schrell, business leader of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the unfortunately standing wind, it is so far to hear - and so there were some disappointments of people from the city's north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the employees, says the 40-year-old.
In a close manner with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals lighter with technical measures.
In addition, he puts the open dialogue with the neighbors.
Because Matthias Schrell has some more things in the place.
With the building of the lower axis, Rhenus Midgard continues to put on the carbon imports for power works and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 meters depth form of the terminal, the Capesize-Bulkcar can also be transferred here.
"In this year, we want to cut the 3-million tons markup," so screall.
Besides the Eon cartwork, the import carriage is going to work in the country.
If the GDF-Suez craftwork still goes to the network, 5 million tonnes of carbon imports are realistic per year.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.

The guests made the artificial stick to convert a 15-point distance 13 minutes before closs to a flight, before Piratey gave the game a wall again.
"We have incrediblely turned back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then we have made easily mistakes," said the Bayern Professor Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most proclaimers of the Münchners in the first two parties against the Italian Serial Master Montepaschi Siena and the Poland tracker Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birth place of stand-up Comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago, the variation artist Frank Fay, who began as a conference in the Palace Theatre on Broadway, to tell the number of direct whiskys in a form of speech.
During the years, Fays innovation was built as recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
In life called and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival in this year celebrates its annual Jubileum with over 60 shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"The majority of these headlines started at Carolines and then became more hard until they were too much to get into a club," Hirsch said.
We have conceived this festival so that we can continue working with them.
In this year, there are occurrences of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as of “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy-effective event for armed veterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy is also grown.
A series of comedians that share this year at Festival have become more unconventional ways, such as sendings on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was given with a Sitcom in the cabine view (the Ironic-Shopping Fantasy Football series on FXX) and now has his own Skegge-Show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both in the "Saturday Night Live" and in the "Parks and Recreation" part of the occupation, although it was the most for their viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
As well as Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, consented on racehems, W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of the Comdy.
The largest magnestry of the Festival belongs to an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a station-up comedian, but has developed himself as a highlighted television and movies director and an inofficial comdy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television sending with the title “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV country.
The meeting is located in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitively in the Comedy DNA of Larrys all work," Steinberg said.
He told me if he's here, then he sometimes goes through the gate between two buildings and he's thinking, "Hey, if I lose my whole money, then I may live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of atom negotiations
The Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next atom meeting with the five UN Vetomonds and Germany.
"Now you have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Participants to clear the differences of the last years," wrote External Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
Although it would be a long way, the atomic leader would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides would come to a solution at the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Kids kill game rooms with Machete
Two children in Uruguay have killed a 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12 years old boys had invited their victims to go with them to the birds.
With magnets and measures armed them on Thursday the 11-year-olds and threw the body into a source, reported the journal "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played in a fourth football before their apartments.
The body was found in the next night in the village Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive Strandort Punta del Este.
As alibi, a five-year-year-fearer of the disciples who had taken them should say that they have been sexually attacked by the boy.
But before the police, when the girl described the tattoo without an attack against her, the two boys admitted the preliminary murder of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder called a rivality in the football game.
He was temporarily delivered into a psychiatric youth.
Attendee must be in prison
Because of exclusive human trade, accessory, threat, injury and annuity, the Court of Justice has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three-and-year prisons.
The former federal soldier, which, according to two units in Afghanistan, as a portier, devised a consciousness within a process.
Then, in five cases, he learned women about Internet or phone contacts, which he sent to the strike after a few weeks.
His opposite was forced to break with violence and urgency.
The income of women who had been created for him for a period of years remained.
By confission of phones and SIM cards, he has contacts of women to the outer world.
Along with a colleague who delivered the women, he held them in different borders in the southwest.
There he allowed them to be monitored in part to control their income.
In the case of the court, the complaint claimed that he suffered under a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan came near him in an explosion of life.
After a psychiatric expert, a great doubt of the mental restriction and thus reflected a limited responsibility, the 33-year-old was a comprehensive consciousness.
The Court had no more to understand the damage.
As reported by a Kripo officer, at least four other cases of exclusive human trade were able to be detected after a first review by telephone monitoring measures.
The dismissed interviews were undertaken by high aggression.
In later charges, the consequences would have made her martyrium.
Another witness in which one of the women had discovered the whole body of blue flocks has not made a statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and use in this meter as a normal view.
The complaint suffered his behavior last night.
"He solved himself out of these circles and wanted to lead a whole normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price has also continued on Friday, after concerns about a high boat, a report, which includes the energy supply sector of China w.
The reference oil places for deliveries in December was fallen on 14 cents on 96.24 USD per barrel in Europe late morning in the electronic trade at New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract falled at 39 cents on Thursday, which means a price fall of 5,8 Pro in October.
The big oil offer has charged the prices in the last weeks.
The United States Energy Ministry explained at the middle-week that the US offer has increased by 4.1 million barrel last week.
During five weeks, the boat was cut about 25 million barrel.
However, on Friday, there were indications on a stronger request by two reports on a Aâçwaach in the Chinese production.
This requires a continuous recovery of the Chinese economy, whose growth was increased to 7,8 Pro > in the quarter, after it was reached at the latest position in the previous quarter since two years.
Roh oil from the type Brent, a reference value for international roh oil, also used by US raffiners, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents at 108,58 USD per barrel.
Justice blocked decisions on the stop and risk guideline of the NYPD
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Justice in the United States blocked the order of a judge, requested amendments to the Stop and France Programme (‘Stop and Research’) of the New Yorker Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The 2th U.S. Procurement Court explained that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be issued until it was decided on the city's vocation.
The judge had judged in August the city against the Constitution in the manner of implementing the programme for the suspension and question of persons.
The city introduced a vocation against its assessment and the arranged aid measures to set up a supervisory body for the police to amend their Directive and the relevant training programme.
The Procurement Court heard the arguments for the requested exemption on Thursday.
The vocation report explained that the judge must be devoted from the case because she had lost the American judges' behavior code by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had reacted publicly to the criticism of the Court.
The judge had judged, police officers hurt civil rights of ten thousands of people because they were inconsistently targeted by black and latin American men with the stop-and-Frist programme.
She named an external body for monitoring the implementation of significant changes, reforms in Directives, training and service monitoring, and organized a pilot program with cameras held on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after a control by the police.
A mental debate on the town's vocation was planned after 14 March 2014.
The stand-and-Frist Tactic was criticized by a number of civil rights defenses.
The controls of this type have been in various forms since years, but the number of controls has increased during the official time of the partial citizen Michael Bloomberg at a full-time height of 684.330 in 2011, most of these black and latin American men.
In 2004, four men who listened to all minorities were made claims that developed a collection complaint.
In order to make changes in the NYPD's stop and risk programme, changes will end unfair practices and create more reliable and effective policies and influence the way other police presidents apply the rule.
In contrast, the changes would be the moral of the police, but not the criminality; it would also be lost money and would not solve the larger problem of a police, which, after the outcome of thousands of places in the last year, was pressed.
The Court notes that it does not end the stop-and-Frist practice which is constitutive, but only reform the type of implementation of controls through the NYPD.
From the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is a oase that only dreaming camels
With this appreciation, the first president Wolfgang Henne described the story and fascination of the "Helping Hands".
On Saturday, the birthday of the United Nations was held, which could already show significant success.
The first Chairman Henne reported explicitly about the work of the United Nations.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheyk-Zajed disease house in Nouakchott in 2004.

Henne also enjoyed a new mother-child illness house in Nouakchott
Interestingly in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalised.
Many in Africa are learned as medicals, such as Henne, for example, explanation against Burn-out.
Because of political disasters in the country, it was not possible to take so many travels as planned, but many medicals came to Germany to visit here in different areas.
✔ Containers are regularly sent with material to Africa, so in the market of this year, medical equipment, medicines, bond material, hospital beds and brilliants.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself offered a rich local chlorit, reporting from Mauritania from the mobile greenhouse rebuilt Mercedes vehicles and the experiences of the stam home musicians, which traditionally understood the United, at their tour of Mauritania.

Coulson inserted a phone hacking to check a tip
The earlier news of the Word publisher, Andy Coulson, appeared to have “Telefon-Hacking, Monitoring and Confrontation” in trying to make a wrong tip about a business of the former internal minister Charles Clarke.
State lawyer Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in the Old Bailey, News of the World, in May 2005, a mistakes that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special officer" Hannah Pa日by.
The magazine commanded the detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pa ́bys Voicemails, and persecuted her, but Coulson also called her and left messages as the court experienced.
"By the opinion of the State advocate, Coulson, who is now the issuer of the NotW, no one who is standing before the apartment of people and hopes to take them in fresh fact, but one who wants people to face a story to see their response," Edis said.
He said that notW uses three procedures to investigate stories: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The issuer is personally shared in the method.
Obviously he knows about the second, monitoring, else can't be.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He fights this, but we say, "And if he knew it."
Awareness about a business Clarke was first attacked by notW's feature editing, as a source that was sexually interested in Pa facieby was said: "Don't disturb your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails by his phone by at least three accessories was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found records on the computer of the detective, on which Pa©by and their sister were stored as "projects".
At the time of the research, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Paëby, where they were asked for information about them, explained Edis.
In addition, the former Chefporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup observed the monitoring of the movements of Pa日by.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow I want to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson A ́s in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, including the former internal minister David Blu ́tt.
The shadows heard on Thursday that Coulson Bluett was confronted by a business with a married woman when he was lied to the complained Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks strive to have a remote phone between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have granted the phone hacking.
From Protest against the planned river tax, the French Fussball has actually carried out the first street since 1972.
A clearing meeting is unexpectedly ended.
In the conflict of rich taxes, the Government and the Profis-Fussball in France have been handed up after a disappeared reporting meeting in a sack-gase.
Although President François Holland received on Thursday in Paris's Elysée Palast of Uniteds and Foreigns, and also listened to their claims.
However, he refused to make the Fussball from the 75 percent planned income on more than one million euros per year, which would have to solve all the companies of the country for two years since 2014.
Moreover, the opposite remained heart.
The stream announced for the end of November will also be conducted, and the Chief of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, shared with.
Thus, the game days between 29 November and 2 December are included in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2.
Facilities: No absolute protection possible
"We want to join the inhabitants early in the planning," opened citizen Jens Höußler the citizen information event on highwater protection concept in consequences.
80 participants came to the Community Halls to make the planned measures clear to ask questions, to express thoughts and to introduce ideas.
Heußler explained: "The last decisions fall from the members of the Community."
The highwater, which occurred on 15 May 2009, was unprepared, was an increasing event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, such as Höußler.
A flush area investigation was granted with the neighborhood Aidlingen, which is now based on the high water protection concept in consequences.
"The protection of many beba's basic pieces is the goal," as the boyster.
Based on the planning of protection from a German Weather Service is statistically expecting highwater every 100 years.
The climate change will be taken into account by a 15-processful addiction.
This is included in sections with "HQ 100aKlima".
The watermasses that had led to significant damage in 2009 are a 1000-year highwater.
"A absolute protection doesn't exist, but a relative improvement we can achieve," as the teacher.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClima, it must be invested in consequences about four million euros, which can be calculated by the community with country protection by approximately 70%.
However, the leader indicates that it is the help only when a general concept is implemented.
This is how the community is focused on the contribution of the citizens.
An existing planning and approval procedure should be resolved.
In the best case, the implementation can be started in 2016.
In addition, the protection concept, which was already presented in the last week in the Community Indret (We reported) local measures in the light of the flood of Irem from the Stammhouse Valley.
In addition to the presentation of the highwater protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to introduce their offers.
In addition, it was questioned why no longer planned drums and retentions for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kuhn, the expert of the commanded engineer office forests and corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, pointed out that it needs the sum of all proposed measures to achieve the desired goal.
Moreover, you are keeping to find the most economic solution, such as Joachim Wald of Wald and Corbe.
Immut was dominated in the hosts of the altar, who have still suffered under a overload of the channel network, even in normal wheat lines.
The problem is in the administration and the first action has already been taken.
However, the Commission noted that the Directives for channel systems are other than for high water protection and that cannot be mixed.
The community is committed to express the channel network so that rain events may be strengthened by two-three years.
Increasing size of water waste channels, millions would disappear.
Severe damage after coincidence
On the early Friday afternoon, on the road 44 near Revensdorf, two car vehicles were severely harmful in a frontal association.
The police locked the street immediately, but it could say little about the accident.
Nevertheless, there are various statements of witnesses that should be evaluated first.
Fest states that the 19-year-old Le Holdrin of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from gettorf came to her with Hyundai.
Both vehicles were broken together, whereas the woman was so hardly closed that the firewall needed almost a half hours to release her from the vehicle.
The accidental cause remained unclean.
Both injury happiness came in nearly placed hospitals.
The streak remained closed about two hours.
You could call him the US Dostojewski.
Philip K. Dick was a godsucher, a metaphysician, his Romans and his stories also have something serious.
Exclaiming the neighborhood in the outer: the winds, the bar, the highest wind.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with massive oeuvre as the Er fundamentator and the Apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as prophets of the `ananian’s own country.
Some titles have occurred in Heyne Travel, the Haffman's Cassette with the 118 stories of two thousands.
Dick explains America - the kingdom of the atmosphered technical progress, along with Paranoia, security campaign and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had godliness, his latest books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was foolish, they had been assigned to the brain.
He's realized, early, that the computers are divinity.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person distinguishes from a machine, the Creator of a creation.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The murder.
A master of the Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film riders such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Playberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Middenty Report" comes from 1956, he strikes the Church of the Cald War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is developed here the principle of the "pre-crime", "Pre-Crime", so what is between more or less of the white house's white doctrine.
In Dick's world, who looks like our terrifying, the Mutants look in the future - and the police takes it up.
"We recognize individuals who have not violated any law," says the leader of the Authority.
"We're taking them away before they can commit a violence crime."
And: "In our society there are no severe crimes, so we have a strategy full of pessue crimes." They read time streams.
They assume that badness happens, and prevent the criminal thoughts to be implemented in the fact.
Dick's story acts like the blue pause for the anti-Terror-Gesetz and the NSA's absorption.
Anticipation of the attack: This also works Obama's Drohnen philoso and - practice.
But Dick's story is not ended yet.
The police officer lamentates that there is no longer a division of violence, the military controls every day - and what is left by the State.
Then the supervisory will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system's going through.
It's perfect, but it's l.
It finds his own conditions.
It takes mistakes and sacrifices not only in purchasing, but builds it up.
The system creates the fighting.
Philip K. Dick means reading, always getting the truth closer.
Specification of labels in Russia
The former US Secret Service Expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in Russian Asyl in the United States Space Affairs on Bundescancer Angela Merkel.
The representatives of the German Federal Agency could ask or take a written question or take the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, reported the Interfax Agency.
Earlier, the Green-Bundagsman Hans-Christian Strobeles had found the first German Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the business.
Increasing NSA enth’s enth’s company paranoia due to State monitoring
On a mild day, August, a German police officer flew deeply over the United States Consulat in Frankfurt, the capital of Germany.
In order to introduce the Federation of Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Control (BVT), of the German Internal Secret Service, he should photograph the box of the US foreign post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the existence of monitoring rates and the action led to a change between the United States and the German foreign minister in Berlin.
James Öpper, American Director of National Intelligence, repeated in September that the United States did not have the possibilities of the foreign spanish “to steal the secrets of foreign enterprises in the United States firms in order to develop their international competitiveness or their winning”.
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become whistleblowers, with the publication of his Fühling Horn to US monitoring secrets, governments and business leaders have no longer been sure whether they can take the Director.
Reports that the National Security Agency exposed the Brazilian Olfirma Petrobas and provided data of the Cloud Provider of Google and Yahoo's data have brought the company paranoia to a new maximum level due to State monitoring.
The fashion to overcome was the enth holding that the officer Angela Merkels was connected to the phone, perhaps for age.
If the most powerful person in Europe is able to take a visage, it is also possible for business guides.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think this data is likely to be used for mutual benefits.
"The Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States now had a nearly large risk like China when it was about industrial pionage and data depth, such a question that was published by the EY adviser in July.
However, in the documents transmitted by Snowden, there was no idea that the United States had sent the business secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
more concerns have expressed that the EU has lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependency from the United States.
The enterprises are skeptic.
On Friday, we were proposed to build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them quietly again...
"This doesn't work," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong IT industry, you shouldn't have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subvented, from cars to agriculture.
Everything until the IT broadcast.
However, realistic and technical raffinations of US spying companies discovered by the Snowden enths have shocked that had previously seen the largest spionagerisco in China.
Cloud Computing finds a big change, since business leaders are now more conscientious that the data stored in the United States are undertaken and therefore potentially supported.
According to one of the Cloud Safety Alliance, a trade institution who has been conducted, appealed to the ends of the US data-mining A facilities with Prism about ↓ Pro© of the non-US members' plans to use an American supplier.
Jim Snabe, a representative of SAP business leader, says: "We see a new question of customers that haven't been done a year ago – she sounds: Where will my data be stored and you can guarantee that this physically remain in this legal room?"
Dutch business leaders represent the view that the youngest reports are just what they already knew, namely that powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they must be observed at all prices.
It is not surprising that economic spionage is located.
It was always like that.
"It was a subject for many years and has not been fundamentally changed by the current debate," says Kurt Bock, president of the Chemical Undertaking BASF.
The Americans spion us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the enterprise is usually not aware of the oppositions you have taken, because it provides adequate benefits.
In large enterprises, workers have long been observed that the participation of a free USB stack on a mixture or the unreserved laptop laptop in the hotel room is not ratically said.
Ulrich Hackenberk, representative member of the Audi car manufacturer, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a present meeting so that they can not be used as hearing devices.
The German BVT advises Führer forces to use simple prepaid hands when they go on foreign travels, because artphones may be compromised.
The Prepaid hands are removed behind.
However, there is anxiety that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attachable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these enterprises are worldwide market leaders in the respective neck.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises have often received experience, personal and financial resources to effectively enhance operational secrets against not authorised access”, warns the BVT in a report.
The United States warn their own companies against economic spending through other countries.
According to Washington Post, in the US National Intelligence Estimates were assigned in February France, Russia and Israel behind China at the border of two of the countries that served for the acquisition of economic data of the hacking.
A representative member of a German Blue Chip undertaking agreed when it was to be economic spionage, then “in the French the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former leader of the French Internal Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very exactly that all countries, even if they work in the fight against the terror, are spying their associates.”
Highlights: Measure gives response to holiday questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery travel that man can take," said the Philosoph Sören Kirkegaard.
Tips, as at least the holiday was held, now gave a special middle in the domain in holidays.
Representatives were important suppliers around a holiday.
A trend: The retro-look has kept up again.
This starts at the holiday clothes.
It's white, the best covered or in creme.
Before, the many-time closing closing clothing with stuckers, often with a slider, they go backwards down and often end in a snap.
However, the spirits, such as Stefanie Koch, are more distinguished from the house of clothing.
In gentlemen, the accessory is dominated with West and Plastron, but it can also be chosen creme color or brain combine.
It was explained to be important to select the local.
Smockless neighborhood rooms are not optimal, the environment should be especially.
Here the domain took note of its own boat in the chair.
Whoever then wants to go with the cutch has a boat for it, Uwe Link.
"But the kitchens are also for boys' chains," he says.
Romantic is also asked for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for holiday images.
The "After-Wedding photo" is always more inside, so the series of records in special places, preferably about waterfalls, some days after the festival, but in holiday clothing, Elizabeth Keidel explained.
More details of the learned holiday were presented in the dominant on Sunday.
Blurry arrangements, rings, holiday chairs, kitchens and also a cowber, such as Marko Ripperger, the guest can be able to interview stylely.
Don't forget the right cosmetic and nail.
Everything for an unforgettable festival.

Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a co-rolled rainmate in the tournale of his High School, are convinced that her son was killed, the lawyer of the family explained on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the United States Federal State of Georgia was found on 11 January in a strictly established mate behind the tribe in the school.
The research officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family doubted.
"You are convinced that her son was killed," said Benjamin ́mp, a lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
You'd never believe he'd died as the sheriff concluded.
"They think that every logic is against the laws of the physics and the healthy human understanding," sopped.
Moreover, they are convinced that the truth will be tried to smite the person or persons who are responsible for the death of their Son.
"Your son went to school and returned to the body sack," he commented.
US State lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday, there will be an formal investigation of death Johnson, since a number of important questions are still unclean.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death to return to a crime?
It explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday.
I follow the way they also lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I represented the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy pointed out that Johnson was disrupted on the consequences of a "position-conditioned extent".
However, a second autopsy has produced another cause of death, such as Moore.
"There are a number of questions to be answered or addressed," he said.
Moore F.e., if there are sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation on the death of Johnson, he will reject the FBI with the implementation of investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not immediately prepared for a comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in the South Georgia ordered the middle-week that the authorities should release all monitoring videos that have checked the investigators.
The teenager's parents hoped that the video records contained indications about how he was dead.
CDC Public Allergy Guidelines for Schools
In the midweek, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for trafficking with food alergies of children in schools.
These are the first directives issued by the US Government, since the number of school-related children with food alergies increases.
One of the 20 children in the United States has a foodalergy.
The broadcast of food alergies among children has been increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are to wake awareness of food alergies in the teacher and the employees and like children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that epinephrin schools have advantage – the auto-injection of EpiPen marks are used most often – to meet a potential mortal survival reaction.
The legislators in the States have recently changed the rules so that epinephrin schools can be easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called by children who show an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels like something in my tongue," "My tongue feels as if a hair lies on it" or "My tongue strips."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "inconsistent sex"
Germany is the first nation in which a family is recognised for children who were born with unexpected genitals.
Newborn is no longer allowed men or women.
In accordance with the new law, parents need to declare no family anymore for such children, but they can specify "inconsistent" or "not set" in the birthtime.
The objective of the Law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to take overcome decisions relating to operations for a sexual assignment to newborn, and to combat discrimination of intersexual humans.
A intersexual person says BBC years later: "I am not a man or a woman."
I'm keeping the flick work created by doctors and full of narrows.
In fact, one of 2.000 children every year does not come as a boy or as a girl to the world.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis “Sexual Fisheries Station” (DSD) a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes, chemical wheels (eruptions or heads) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was probably intersexual.
The understanding of sexual identification has not yet been very well developed, but most experts in the United States suggest that you should use the best available information for sexual admission, if not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide for a operation.
The New Yorker psychiater Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialised the problem of sexual identification, said that the new German law “sounds after a good thing”.
Intersexual children have a ethical dilemma.
"Many people have life threatening diseases that require a chirurgical attack, but most children do not apply it," he said.
You can take a sexual assignment without operation and then wait for the development of the efficiency.
The scientific data about how a child develops its sexual efficiency are not very precise.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret, why people are homosexual.
In a report to the European Commission of 2011 it means that intersexual humans are different from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not sexual, but is conditioned by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in severe sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breast and stature, primary sex characteristics such as fortress organs and genitals, or in chromosomoum structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination that intersexual and transgender persons looks like in professional life, as well as on the measure of disappointment, violence and prejudicial crime.
You don't have a special camp now.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults to specify men, women or “three generations”.
In June, Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first “unfair” person worldwide after a court had been able to maintain a “not-determined” family status.
Dutch exhibitions have a strict assignment, X for intersexual, so the Ministry of Intersexual.
In the neighboring France, family themes are still counter, so a message to France 24.
In 2011, thousands of French lawyers of the strict Catholic country petitioned that the “sexual theory” should be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also spoke against the German Law, with the reason: “If the world is cut into a new condition, where the family is a decision, but not a sexy A·, we turn two other columns of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to the baby Zone that she felt better when babys were assigned to a family at birth.
"The parent in this is also stressed enough without any other restrictions, especially if you don't know the family of your own child," she said on the parent site.
Children need stability and safety.
History was seen children who were born both with men and women, as Hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God, who had both generations.
Age ago, the medicine considered the family as something that could be removed and then rebuild.
However, the ethical bases of a operation will be doubted after it is now complicated with the complexity of the severity, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they don't know how the child feels when he grows up with the family assigned to them.
“In the 20th century, it was called a “psychiatric emergency””, said Drescher.
If such a child was born, it was not called the psychiater but the chirurg.
The governing theory on the treatment of children with unexpected genitalies returns to Dr. John Money from John's Hopkins, who dealt with the view that the family is formable.
He expressed the term “sexual efficiency” and argumented, social and environmental attacks – such as parents learning a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and expressed a person as a man or a woman.
However, in a case under the title “John/Joan” since 1966, his theories were contradictive.
He threw the parents of a boy whose penis was cut off at a broken circumcision to cast the child completely and to remove his heads and then to lift him up as a girl.
"Money presented this case as an example of a conversion, which he did not have," so Drescher.
When the boy was approximately 15, he turned back to men's sex and married a woman.
But by 38, he committed self-sufficiency.
It says that there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, the survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public, which are "not happy with the result".
So about Jim Bruce, a 36-year old author from Montana, who was born with XY-men's chromosomes, but two-duty genitals.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a big client or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “friendly life” as a man.
So his external organ and the heads were quickly removed chirurgically after the birth of 1976, and he was raised as girls.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unfortunate, but it was really hard to ask questions.
In the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressive and knew that something was wrong, he asked his medical acts.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one has ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD which could not produce enough testosteron for the development of genitals.
After he learned the truth, he changed to human efficiency, received testosteron injections and left his wheat away.
By the operation, he has become unforgettable.
Today, he strives for others in a organization called Intersection Project to view intersexual humans as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, business leader of the legal group sitting in California, advocates for Informed Choice, ensures that the German law is able to "injury to decrease and maturize".
“Multiple activists are concerned that the German decision may motivate parents to make quick decisions and to allow the child to be not defined,” she explained.
We are afraid that will benefit interventions.
We think it would be better to show the male or female sex and then wait.
However, we do not even know how the law will be influenced, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization was under the Australian Law, 'for it allows adults to recognize as a generation'.
“Working should be able to make own decisions about their legal sex,” she explained.
The German law refers to the assignment to birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they are raised, they can decide themselves over their body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual difference and supports hundreds of others in a self-aid group, says that the German law "complete" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with men's chromosomes, but a DSD namedly has a complete androgen resistance.
Because of the reception effect of the target cells for testosteron, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but no outerus or eggs.
Today Katie 29 is married and married; she is in the 日 of Pennsylvania as a worker in the child psychiatries.
However, if it is inevitable, it is hoped to get a child by adoption or a mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make decisions overwhelmed," Baratz said.
It provides them the time to make different tests and clothe things and gives them so much time before they write "man" or "who."
In this way, everything is okay – you take the child large and let it go.
You have a beautiful baby, and you enjoy your parents' lucky.
And you don't have to overcome a operation that does not allow you to reject anymore.
“This includes the children in the decision with and removes the best of the parents in the case of their opinion that they would not do the right,” she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the family that is better with him – and that is wonderful.
This means that children are able to make the decision themselves.
Unknown lost girls by shooting out of the car
A 12-year-old in Sachsen-containment has been lost in shoes from a car.
In the morning of Genthin, the teasers had probably made an air pressure weapons on a group of children.
That shared the police in Burg.
The girl was easily hurt at the left wheel.
Salvation forces made the girl to the hospital.
The shot came out of a small car, which was passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
The Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
In addition, the tissues shot on a bus holder.
A boat breaks.
Then they went out.
The criminal police recognised it on Friday.
To this time, the police inspection campaigns can look back to a slow Halloween night.
The employees were only called two times for egging children, who threw them against households.
Since the householders recognized this rightly and the egg residues were remote at the same time, there should also be no shame.
Moreover, some silver deaths were burned in the city area, but there was no shame.
A resident in Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his pkw was developed with clopapage and was displaced by his raids.
However, until the police arrived, the man discovered his counsellers in the nearby, all again, so the police should not continue to be used.
Living with future perspectives
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreaming.
Your house is located in a strong residence of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, good neighborhoods and not even too much forever.
In the town there are just a few minutes with public resources.
"I hope you don't have before spending?" Waltraud Ries asked and showed a fat spin on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me sometimes.
But you know how hard this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spinner phobie, but the concern that, in the age of a lot of steps to house and in the apartment, she explains.
Moreover: Since a menicus operation, the middle five five cigarettes in their own body have to find out what it means to move with the handicap of stockwork to stopping.
Recently, a book from her is shown to the theme "Happily living in the age - What is the best form of living for me?"
"Our apartment is the best example of what's not going on in the age," she starts to tell.
When she went to the Maisonette apartment over 20 years ago with her husband, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks different about it.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all with the theme 'Home in the age'.
Most of the people hurt it as long as it goes.
They're always old, they're just the other, she's saying smileful.
Only if the pressure of suffering is really big, think.
"And then it can be too late," so Ries.
In its book, the inner architectin presents 17 live models for a self-determined residence in the age.
"What a living form you choose is always a individual decision," she explains.
D i e solution is not given for the age.
Even those who can be able to have the age station in the Toscana or the Bretagne should always assume that he can also be sick.
And: "without knowledge of the country, you also agree in Dolce Vita," the section gives the memory of voluntary volunteers in the Dolce Vita.
Under their models, classic maintenance models, alternative residence forms or often cited Rentner WG are available.
At the age, everyone has his tickets and mackens
"For me would be a community like that but nothing," she means with an eyewater.
Not even as in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
"In the age, you're just getting his back dreams," so Ries.
However, that an older community can work, the book will not be excluded.
But then it must be different than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, you believe it.
With this opinion, it is not at least in the capital of the country.
"The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment," is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the leader of the civil service life in the age of the country's capital.
Your service is aware of people around the theme 'Be older'.
Therefore, older people would often also take incompatibleness and restrictions in purchasing only to remain in their habitual environment, that is also the experience of the establishment warnings.
There are many opportunities today to make the house or the apartment free.
Ries recommends everyone who works with the ancient construction of their home or their apartment to inform himself of the first handworker.
Today, there are also specialists for the ancient construction.
Even in the apartment, it is possible to realize one or another, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the internal architecture is opened.
But the existing apartment is not always able to become older and thus a bar of freedom, even if it lies so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
If you could install a travel lift within the apartment, which would also be the greatest hinder with traps loaded up to the apartment gateway.
She will continue to search until she found the ideal object for her husband and her husband.
Before the round, she was more than before she was stuck at her apartment door.
USA wants Snowden to continue persecuting criminally
The United States have not changed their attitude to the former US secret service worker Edward Snowden.
He will continue to have transmitted unlimited secret information.
Therefore, he must be punished in the United States, the speaker of the US Foreign Minister, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even the latest expressions of Snowden would not change it.
Previously, the German Green-Politicer Hans-Christian Strobele after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow had called the United States to not continue to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki highlighted that it was a strong statement of a Parliament and not a German Government member.
The secret service of Edward Snowden is based on a talk with the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This clarified the former NSA employees seeked by the United States in a non-addressed letter, which the Green-Christian Green Politician Strobele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and continued to the Federal Government, the Bundesday and the Advocate General.
The writing has the following text, after one translation broadcast by Stroble:
To the competent authorities
I was requested to write to you about your investigation on mass monitoring.
I was Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (0) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became a Witness of systematic law violation of my government, which led me from moral obligation to act.
As a result of the publication of these thoughts, I saw a serious and stoping herd that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in the exile and enjoy a periodic asyl, which gives me the Russian Føderation under international law.
I'm proud of the resonance to my political actions, both in the United States and in the other part.
The citizens in the world and also the high official of the United States - have enthusiasms on a system of overall monitoring that is worth no account as a public service.
These spionage enthries are many proposals on new laws and directives, which aimed at the formally covered misuse of public confidence.
The benefits of the society from these obtained recognitions will be much clearer; at the same time the risks in purchase were significantly reduced.
Although the results of my efforts were evidently positive, my Government considers this as a faithful breakdown and stress, then, to criminalize and complain political opinions.
However, the truth is not a crime.
I am convinced that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will dismiss this negative attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are made, I will be able to share me in the responsible statement of experts relating to the statements contained in the media, especially in the context of the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and legally.
I am pleased to talk to you in your country as soon as the situation has been established and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international law which is concerned with us all.
Edward Snowden pronounced by Hans-Christian Strobele
Child Garden found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's citizen Michael Maier.
The former child garden in the street has dedicated the community to a person.
The Community enterprise agreed at its youngest meeting in the non-governmental part.
The building changed his owner to a "adjusted" price.
"The assembly is satisfied," says Mayer.
In the budget, 100 000 euros were employed.
It is still not clear how the new owner wants to use the previous child garden.
The citizen master is right that winterling has given the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else, and therefore no longer needs to come up for the interview of the house, how to be hungry, looking for the garden and running the road.
"There is now away," rejoices Mayer.

Honeck thanked in this framework to all those who had helped to do the first musical hock.
Report: Obama campaign decided to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton
The highest advisers of President Barack Obama, in secret, decided to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the election battle in 2012 by Hillary Clinton, as the New York Times.
The enth-section is the most appreciated surprise of the long expected work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the election battle 2012, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times presents a copy of the book that appears in the darn and reported on the morning that the president's top advisers would have carried out “increasing group meetings and issues end 2011” to find out whether it would look better for Obama's speeding hope to re-elect when he would fall out of the offers.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book based on the history of the efforts of the leaders of the campaign and the White House, particularly the former White House Chef of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect it has on the survey values to change the former foreign minister Clinton against the vice-Presidents.
The potential exchange was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office.
Only a half of the highest adviser of the President –Daley, the former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and the former leader of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the change.
In the Duble Down, Daley has been at the top of the efforts to offer a change of their "one, personal relationship" before you dismiss such a shock move, after the data showed that the Clinton's candidate would not improve the opportunities of Obama's.
In a interview with Martin, Daley said that the Government actually had decided to replace Bides by Clinton.
"I expressed a whole range of things that should be put into the ship, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
It is necessary to remember that the President had a terrible investigation, so we thought, "O God's will, what are we doing?"
In the case of Daley, the investigations as “invited concern” were included, Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for the recovery of a significant opportunity to find out whether such a move would be paid to the elections.
"In campaigns, there is no much money for questionnaires and focus groups if you do not think seriously about anything," said Martin on ­360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was looking for a exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley whether his then-based boss would know about the potential exchange.
Although Daley explained that he didn't believe that the President of the possible change was "conscient", the former staff officer said that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin refused to say "Double Down" doesn't give a final answer to the question whether the political sentences of Obama would have reached the writing.
Cooper asked Martin whether he really thinks Obama didn't know anything about the investigations whether to let the offers fall at the elections.
"People," Martin said.
What's going on with my e-mail?
Email named "Yes" email.
Did the e-mails have been implemented technically in the design of the Internet service?
In the concept of early internet services, it was in the first way to make communication possible.
Therefore, in the basic technical protocols, there was no view of creating a stable foundation for an insurance change of letters.
Therefore, a original mail is more than a open mail card than a secured letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
The e-mail program or the browser of 日 first step sends the mail to the mail of their service provider.
For example, if she had a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail-→ sends the contents to the provider using Benni.
On the stream, the mail can run over some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to the Provider.
Are original emails contacted on their way through the network?
Most mails will be delivered several times by software robots.
When the sender provider is normally checked whether the mail leads to a damage programme as an attachment.
On the recipient systems a virus check will also be taken.
▪ the suppliers check whether it is a lossful and unrequired spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another job?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also provides the information needed by Google to place context.
If you and Benni communicate through GMail about their coming vacation journeys, Google can include the corresponding links to vacation offers.
Read also unknown people the emails?
The probability that unable to read a mail is extremely small.
Theoretically, but it is possible.
In companies often have fabrikers the possibility of e-mailing.
Moreover, the sentences and secret services have legal opportunities to catch or recognize e-mails.
This is the possibility of illegal exposure action.
Is it possible to send e-mails against meditation?
By encrypting by OpenPGP standard, a mail can be encrypted effectively against meditation.
It is also possible to reduce the metadata of a e-mail communication that can not even be recognised without any further information who has communicated with.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
In the mainly used private mailboxes, Yahoo and Google plays a study of Convios Consulting from August 2013 only a subordinated role.
Since the shares of Yahoo-Mail tolets were fallen, GMail from Google could make it clear.
Mother wounded in the forest and casted rounds
When his deceased mother died, a man from Wolfsburg cut a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued casting their rents and wages.
In order to be able to acquire rents and payments, a 67-year Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest.
At the end of his death of the 89-year-old, he spent the money for more than a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for disturbance, as a speaker said on Friday.
Then the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already deceived in May: At that time, no medicine was needed for the needed mother.
The Ermittlern told the trainer that his mother was traveling to Spain.
Because this was wonderful, they continued.
It was found that the two had been in a common apartment since more than 15 years and he had recently planted them.
The 67-year-old s\t's murdered his mother's death.
A obduction stated that the police did not have a detention point for a capital crime.
Does it go on icecreme that lights in the darkness?
A British undertaking has developed the first lighting ice in the darkness – using calls.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent characteristics of the seasters and made it a lighting leckery.
The idea came to him after he had conducted a research work on qualities and could convince Chinese professionals to make the lighting protein artificially.
The icecreme reacts in the destruction of the tongue, which highlights the pH value in the protein and eliminates the light.
Chris explains that the food is reacting to the warmness in the mouth and lighting – as far as you are so laughing, more it will be.
Charlie, the founder of the I'm Delicious Iiscremefima, says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early phase of production, and so it gets two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the icecreme reacts with the tongue in a neutral pH value.
When the mouth heat the protein, the pH value and iron increase.
We have tested it in the last months, and it seems ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful light effect.
It is probably the most precious ice creme I ever made, because the calcium light is four times more thirsty than gold.
Each bowl costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's pretty good for it.
Charlie's experimental company with a Sitz in Bristol is famous for their unusual dressing directions, which belong to birds, cakes, breast meat and black gold.
But his latest creation must be ambitionated.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible icecreme."
This is not possible for itself and for itself because of the light breakdown that is called out by the eiscreme from which is a ice creme; but I think we can find an opportunity to create it.
The icecreme uses the fluorescent characteristics of a calle that is artificially manufactured by Chinese professionals
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball banding after six days.
Right now, it comes to the Team of Ingo Ehlers to Derby to the TSV Daverden, who has made the end of his first victory last week.
With this game, the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehlers' behavior is optimistic.
He finally has, with the exception of the permanent lost Hendrik Blohme, his full framework.
Also Daverden puts us on a time game.
Therefore, we must keep our error rates low.
In the first line, however, it is necessary to increase in the covering, which later has left everything other than a safe impression.
In fact, Daverden Coach Thomas Panitz is depressed after the first seasonship against North Horn.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But this is why we are not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can be done.
Eventually, Panitz wants to set up now in Morsum to start a series.
Fellen will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this reason, the A-Young Joost Windßuß, which is active with double game right to the A-Young Boundsligist HC Bremen, is his season depth.
Whoever is not warm in such a game will stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was young, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were going to eat sweetness, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today, I've been to Halloween Mouffel.
In the last two years, I haven't been ready to distribute from my apartment from sweetness, and I'm not going to do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black shepherd, which refers to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be accurate – celebrate Halloween this year and grant a total of $6,9 billion for sweetness, costumes and decorations, so the United States single handers' association (NRF).
One thing I'm enjoying every Halloween again is the trend values.
The costs will be approximately 1.2 billion of $6.9 billion, as the NRF.
In this year, increasing unbearable objects of the last cry are.
Women do not have to be in sexy clothing, they can now be able to cursed for transporting food, such as pizza, hamburger or carotes.
As men are concerned, I expect every multitude of zombies thanks The Walking Dead, and I think the Daft-Punk-Weltraum members will create it in the Instagram Feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched zombies, Batman, Pirates and Hexen are.
I think it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We have dressed our dogs last year, and we were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, the Americans have 330 million € this year for the costs of their home animals, such as the NRF.
That's a lot of "Hot Dogs".
What kind of sweetness is, we're not humble.
Americans will be published this year for 1,9 billion, as the Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, luts, bonbons and gumbernators.
So it is a news for the US Handle Ministerial 41 million people who take through the fourth with the language “Soulness or Saures”.
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilo chocolates for Halloween and – we do nothing – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn sugar; however, 15 million kilograms of Halloween will be exhausted, as the National Connection of Sweet Producers.
That's about nine billion meat currencies.
It's a shot that I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than homes in which it shots.
They have great names such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which remains in a real prison), “Ho-O-Scream” and “The House of Shack”.
There are actually ↓00 of the recognised spikehouse in the United States that achieve 500 million rescue, so America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pick up into the horse and then put the friends on Facebook, where you don't solve them again, and then one of the types on which you are standing, let a comment be like “after the vision expression”.
But we're finally coming to the cookies.
Charlie Brown made us confident with the big corb when we were children, and the cutting of a corbslatter is like the wheat of the woman's ba – something that we have made from small.
Happy, the “Baby in Kürbis” started the first year ago thanks to Pinterest, so most of us were wakened up to cut the corb and not to sit there.
This year, Americans will be issued about 106 million € for cowbiss, so the US Census Bureau.
The crabslaters who are slowly destroyed in the foreground garden are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms were produced in this year.
If you want correct points, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut down some shoes from their 921 kilo hard cow.
Accommodation fuel in Helmburchts: Rescue forces mountain cold body
The firewall must have expressed in Helmburchts at the latest weekend.
A triefamilie house in the Court of Justice is taking fire in the night for Friday.
The salvation forces flow a cold body from the house.
Saving forces have found a cold body in a dreifmylien house at a fire in Helmburchts.
Whether a resident is still unclear, as a police speaker said in Bayreuth.
At the last Thursday, it was burned in the earthquake of the house.
When the firewall arrived, the flames had already shot out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room completely exhausted.
The whole earthquake has been protected.
All other residents were not home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
The building is no longer resident.
The accurate cause for fire was not clear.
The largest country of Germany has started an openly started in order to promote the pastor's profession.
The background is a potential absence of pharmaceuticals: The Evangelical-Luterian Landskirch Hannover calculates that the number of them now will be half around 1.800 passengers and pastors in the present position until 2030.
For young people today the profession is very attractive and offers future perspectives, pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Presse Service.
It is attractive to determine the work and daily department itself.
With Burfies, the countrykirch first ordered a pastor at a full place to please young people for the theology study.
Currently, less young people decide to study theology.
Burfia brings this back to the process of discourse: "God's voice is light, the world is sound."
This is the fact that the vocation of great freedom and employment is increasing.
I am the Lord of my appointment calendar and I can put my points on where it is important to me.
Pastors may be close to people as sisters.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
It is certainly more paid in the free economies, but theologists would have a safe employer.
This comes to the young people today who are not only about Kare, but about a sensitive work.
According to the Country Country, which includes three quarters of the Netherlands, currently, about 60 passengers in the rest of the year.
At the same time, approximately 40 members of a theological study start their vicariat.
In tonnes, the border areas such as the hard, Emsland or Wendland may eventually be difficult to postpone places.
Burfien wants, among other things, to work for young people and to invite Prominents who have studied theology.
The theological study offers a broad education.
You can even be a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
Inside, rental and six points are located as well as a free space facility.
The options are available from strengthened brems, a service package with maintenance of Bowler-Works mechanisms and logistic support until the vehicle installation between events.
Drew Bowler, business leader of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally-conditions that come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced drivers, but people who are on search for spending and aventure, as well as in a way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will make new opportunities to prepare the different Rally-disposition lines in the United Kingdom and the foreign and to prepare new people for the strapages and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Wagen – that will be a sustainable mastership.
Moreover, in the Defender Challenge, there is a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to share in the wilderness rounds in North Africa and the Near East.
Firewall called to save a stone, which was 15 meters over the ground on an eight-year-year round prevention in a stone break
Cockerspaniel handicap Ruby was disappeared after a smaller deficiency accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a spacious passager in stone break in her mistake
Firewaters switched away from the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The firewall was able to make a stone safe, set up on a 15 meters high forward in a rock wall.
The nine months old cockerspaniel handicap Ruby was running after an accident on Sunday Monday and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a stone break in the middle of the week.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, whose dogs belonged, came to the rockbruch Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take Ruby again in receipt and thank you to the firewalls of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were deceived to search for their missing hairin and publish help calls in social networks, when they disappeared after the small injury accident in the stone break.
About 14:15 at the middle of the middle of the middle of the hour, a spacious traveler who carried out his dog, the wounded Ruby on the 15 meters high subparagraph in the stone break.
The technical backup team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station took place and departed to save Ruby, which was then transported in a dogbox upward.
Andy ́yton, a specialist of the technical team of salvation, said: “He was in an age.
She was in the middle of the wall – 15 meters from above and from the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her salvation – she was as steady frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she eat a few dogs.
That was a very unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist of the technical team of salvation, said: "Ruby had a riesening lucky."
It was the possibility that she was very harder or worse.
Ruby was conducted to the animal to investigate, but he did not determine anything except creation and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “It was terrible to see salvation.
I couldn't believe she was really there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The animal explained that if the creation had become too large and would be broken, it would probably be destroyed.
The firewalls have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so thankful and everyone of them was absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We had to stop her, but she remained up."
The firewalls were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never accepted Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio sender this week the Pop-Star said, she joined as a background song on Jaggers' song “Old Habits The Hard” from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the Altroker at night, and that “he had bound me when I was 18”.
She added: "This is a long time ago, and he was very beautiful to me."
In a clothing, a representative of Jaggers, 70, on Thursday, said that he “declined categoryly that he had ever taken food trials at Katy Perry”.
The representative added: "It may be that she has changed him with someone else."
Perry was one of the songs that had a guest in the Rolling Tour this year.

George Kerevan: European divorce gives the shots the choice
A new day, a new terror history of independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to attend Schengen space as a condition for the EU Membership.
This provides the steak for stories on pass controls in Berwick and a safe border with stacheld road at the Hadrianswall.
In fact, in the Strathclyde model, the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but that was, in expectation, not a role in the slight lines.
Furthermore, no one realized that the EU Member States often have to strike their strict rules if it is more favorable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen space, the continuous non-respect for Brussels would be only a small accommodation in contrast to what you really want from the shots.
So there's no story.
And one that has already arrived in the years that she is already like a fossil: I have heard the "Independence means pass control" entity at least 40 years ago.
This is a very interesting point when we continue to repeat this ural story.
Why should it be expected by an independent Scotland that it is after the ≥ pipe?
Why does the London Joch change against the Brussel, especially now?
This is the real news: the greatest, greatest, after the war's greatest plan to join Europe has been brought into stocks.
The project of Europe has been dead with the Eurocrisis.
Parties won overall in the EU on lands that are enemies of the EU or want to throw the euro as a Community walk over the board.
Even in Germany, the European skeptical Party could make a alternative for Germany — first in this year – at least five million votes at the Bundesday election in September and thus easily remove the free democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There was always a homeopposition against the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis appears as a turnpoint.
As a result of the strict spar policy involved by Berlin and the European Central Bank in relation to the victory in which the relevant national economy is needed by maintaining the common election, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The Euro crisis has little to make national governments cause exhaustive budgets – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members at exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters, and they want to allow Germans to do so.
Without the possibility of an evaluation of the local village, South Europe is rebuilt with a built product share to Germany.
The only possibility is too short of the payment and public expenditure – incorporated by Berlin.
A deeply passing product problem is behind the current state and wheel problems.
As a result of the “green” energy guidelines set out by Brussels – a code for the subvention of French and German energy undertakings on consumer costs – the industry pays the duplicate for electricity and the fourfold for gas compared to the United States.
This is a greater cost share as we could see in Grangemouth.
All the loan records of the world are not the petrochemical industry before being put into the corner by billigian shipping gas.
As a result, a revolt, especially in France, the EU's unique Cheerleader.
After the war, the Political Elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany was able to keep in Schach and Paris was able to take his eyes with Washington.
However, Berlin did not carry Paris more than the door to political legislation and Europe opened its own economic policy to combat the proposed French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens, EU enemies Front National, has just won a decision and thus refers to the regional socialists to three places.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the electoral votes – a timely warning for the British Labor party that it cannot go out, a splitting in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among the white French of the worker class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to prevent an anti-EU, anti-Community block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU partys are well cut off in these elections, and this is very well possible, then such a block could first dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point that I want to be outside: In not all the future, the growing resistance against the EU and the common wage will be met to decrease the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) N" that is favored by the General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of his satellite companies may hold on the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I hope that the United Kingdom is distant from this project in the hope of joining the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific area is near that the United Kingdom will stand only in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland staying at all of that?
We can decide to be a region of Small England (in the last consequence).
Or we can defend our own economic interests – whatever is to say Berlin and Brussels where they can go.
I think Scotland could be able to walk in a more lockered covenant, if we keep our own choice.
The cooperation with other, similarly thought countries is easier in a non-feeded Europe of N°.
On the other hand, we should insist that Norway is equal and maintains our economic independence.
The SNP Government in Scotland is noteworthy – the most political movement against Spar Policy in Europe and has a special majority in 2011 due to the delay of the proposed (and adopted) shortcomings that the Labor Financial Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib Dem Coalition.
It would be easy for Scotland to decide for independence now only to get a spar policy from Berlin and Brusel.
Earlier pubertation: Quicker wake up
African and Spanish girls trendly obtain the puberty than their white elderly genocides, such as studies.
Corporate changes are not meaning directly the puberty
There is no idea that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic fatity is an exhibitor of the early pubertees
The trend to the early puberty is less exposed to boys
The former CNN Correspondente Pat Etheridge is a journalist who has specialised on child health and family themes.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter had grown in seven or eight years old?
At the annual Conference of the Children's Federation American Aämmy of Pediat this week in Orlando, Florida, the child Endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal under the girls and represented a new standard.
"I'm spending a lot of time to raise parents – usually it's not a sign that the puberty comes quickly," said Caplowitz.
Obvious development shows, such as growing breasts, shame and axes, as well as bodies, are shown in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a easy diffusion in the age of the Menarch (the exhibition of the first regulatory flow) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age of 12,5 years is less than 12,75 in 1970.
“When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years until the menarch,” said Caplowitz, also the author of the book “Froe Puberty in girls: the essential adviser for this common problem.”
Time is the most precise test of the public network.
It is contrary to what actually represents the beginning of the public network, but it applies "free" if the breast size is accompanied by a growth-shirt age of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process is renewed or stagnated – something that a child can monitor exactly.
In faster advances, tests may be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for the delay of a early menstruation and the disorder of another result: the previous age of the bones, which ultimately can lead to growth and thus a small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for medical or hormonal treatment are oriented to the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional rate.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is retainable as medicals, but he adds: “The pressure of the pubert network can be more behavior and feelings of girls than their age genocose.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they keep the hygiene side," said Caplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had received her days.
Even if there were the first signs and we had spoken about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friend's circuit.
There are many comprehensive theories about the causes of early public network.
However, there are no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are reasonable.
Boys come to the puberty like girls earlier.
Caplowitz is the view that the most convinced prize is the epidemy of fatigue.
He supported the implementation of a Property in 2001 on girls in the age of six to nine, which makes a connection between body fat and access to the public network.
Other studies undertaken this conclusion, but there are many others who played a role.
In this country, African and Spanish girls are trendly higher than their white elderly genocose.
There are different statements for this.
Global seems to be an early public network of all possible things affected by economic conditions on climate to genes.
Another ratio: Although the kids are the face and shame behaviour already earlier, the trend is not exposed to a completely captive previous puberty as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underline the complexity of the subject.
The creation of Akne and shammar is spread by children and children.
"We must be careful about how we identifie the real beginning of the public network," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a childhood endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not refuse to give advice from their child’s parents to talk to their child.
"It can mean that you have to lead a talk before you expect," says Caplowitz.
If you remain quiet, the child normally reacts well.
The girls who eat early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes in before than thinks.
Jumbo manufacturers strive in view of large orders on width
Among leaders of aeroplane producers it has come to an extent of the width of seats in the tourist class in long-stream flights, which indicates the sound for a bitter conference on Dubai Airshow this month.
The fight is about the width of the seat, which passengers are offered in long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are working for flight companies most, but this designed room is the key to the efficiency in the latest airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus requested this week a broadcast standard that provides a width of at least 46 cm (18 tonnes) in the tourist class, but the US Erz Boeing says that the flight companies should decide.
The exemption comes to a time when the aircraft builders laid down it, even greater versions of their two engines, and expect records in the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the back part of the aircraft is designed, especially if there are nine or → Seats, it is decided for the specified economic results to provide the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that his modernised "777X" phase 406 persons in the tourist class sitting, which are more than 17 tonnes of widespread and so allowed 日 per row.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of A350 transporters 350 persons in 18 toll broad seats in the tourist class, where there are nine per row.
Aeroplane gigants often share Hibe about technical details through the publication in the chat press.
Now Airbus calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders will probably run directly to the public.
Recently, the company proposed an indication that could be at the beginning of a new display war and showed the money providers a picture in which three persons sit together in an aurant, and thus the title: "Will you accept it?"
"Boeing proposes long-stream flights in seats that are stronger than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Operator Chairman John Leahy.
In view of changed nutritional habits, people are diker, but aircraft seats have not been radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-stream travel, and at the end of the century the weight of the human average Americans has increased between 40 and 49 years of age, so the data of the US Health Ministry.
The rate of the middle American media in the 21th century is 100.8 cm of US health statistics.
Airbus says that his rivals held a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body range of the freshly baptized "Jet Set" was smaler.
As a result, airbus has conducted studies that claimed that a social duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 pro.
Boeing stresses the numbers of airbus to the seats and says it is not to decide in the terms of the manufacturers how flight companies made the balance between flight tariffs and institutions.
The company also explains that the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the aircraft.
“It is really going to give flexibility to flying companies so that they can do what they have to think to be”, states the Boeing Flight Cabine Expert Kent.
They don't want us to dictate them what it makes profitable.
You know their business better than everyone else.
For the aircraft is more freedom, but for the manufacturer it will be a subject that can affect the borders.
After the extent of the extent, a aircraft orders with a estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the next year, which could be sustainable to the export by the US or Europe.
As Reʹs first reported in July, the Sitzlayout is the driving force behind the exhibition around the new jets.
Sowohl Airbus and Boeing claimed 20% more Effecenz per seat at their last two motory long-stream designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seed Boeing 77-300ER.
The statement Boeings on the results depends partly on that the 777X will be compared with its seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The costs per unit are still less than machines currently used with seats per row.
"Boeing therefore gets more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products," Kevin Keniston, leader of passenger comfort at the airbus.
On the other hand, the analysts, full cabins with seats per series of 777s suggested that many passengers decided for the widest arrangement, which could be income with more billiger flight taxes.
“Attty-to-site width would be beautiful for passengers, but the reality is: from a economic point the airbus offer has been distorted by the 777 threats,” says Mary Kirby, expert for cabine facilities, fundamentalist and author of Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no sits but a catalogue of suppliers from which the flight companies can choose.
The well-training Jet sellers are even a band to meet the establishment at the competition.
Even if they appreciate the comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with high-depth equipment for bicycle flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with a seat lines, but it does not mean that it has not been overwhelmed.
In the past, Airbus highlighted the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered a wide seat for some Jets.
Without the support of the only other producer of a large modern jet, experts say that the call will probably be published according to a new brain standard, but could refuse from the whale of 777X sales.
New anti-Nicotin vaccine can make the garaus enjoyment when smoking
Agencies have developed an anti-Nikotin vaccine that could destroy the fun of the smoke.
One single dose of the vaccine was able to make mouse a life long before nikodex.
Before tests on humans, further trials are needed, which can last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cority Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
"We are very hoped that this type of vaccine strategy can help millions of fucking fucking people who have attempted to stop and have tested all the methods available on the market, but they have to experience that their nickot investigation is stronger than these adjustments," so Cor.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains genetic information on the production of nicotine anticorps.
The virus is selectively inheriting the hepatic cells that then produce a continuous power of anti-corps.
The anticorps follow the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they get the brain, thus a smoker does not find nicotine height.
In trials, the incidence of the muscles who were administered with Nikotin was involved in their normal Action level.
Mouse without vaccination, however, would have taken a “awtime”, the researchers explained, a sign that Nikotine has reached her brain.
The experiments are written in Fachblatt Science Translatation Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained anticorps.
The vaccines had to be given so frequently to maintain the anti-corps of the anticorps that they were fair and unpraktic.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower because it converts hepatic cells into anticorps.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he is absolutely sure, may be given children before they try to try a cigarette, and prevent Nikot insight.
But more probably, the fuckers would use him to stop listening.
“They know that when they start smoking again, they do not have any pleasure more because of the Nikotinim product, and that helps them to delay the habits, ” he states.
British economists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that there would be more research needed.
Tripodi strikes to be influenced by Obeid
In contrast to the former Minister of Laborpartie Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by the state of corruption.
The former NSW Minister stresses to have changed the rules for maritime fear on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, which had covered allocations to three baselines on a Stately controlled country.
The Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on Friday on whether Obeid has affected different State ministers to extend the contracts on Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without exemption after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi had been interested in the foundations of Obeids after Tripodi had stated in accordance with the preceding staff leader Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In a year-time talks started in 2005, the Government had committed public statements for the contracts.
The feasts were opposed and wanted longer courses.
2009, the contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which introduced the Obeids for 2.5 million per year, were extended without public statement.
Tripodi, which was from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally expressed for public statements.
However, he refused to have made the amendments on requests of Obeid, who, as Tripodi employed, had led to a restructuring of the government's pattern schemes.
One of the ICAC phone records showed the talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who was changed to the hall ministerial after he had been under the fishing officer.
"Is this theme discussed in these phone talks the development of commercial promises?", asked the Commissioner's representative Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," you answer Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was certainly not.
Finally not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warfare aircraft takes targets, such as or sources
Israeli jail aircraft would have attacked a goal in the Syrian Latakia Latvia, and a leader of the Governing Agency for Fox News.
The officer did not state what was the goal, but said that it was at least one.
Lauthalted Press was the aim of Russian SA-125 rackets.
At least two times this year, Israel has made air fights on racket supplys.
Foreign workers with 457 visa could be subjected to “reality test”
The Government considers, within the framework of extended measures, a "reality test" for foreign workers with 457 visa.
If the test is to be introduced, it shall take over a criteria to prevent the use of the 457 in order to determine unqualified workplace or as the door for the movement of families and friends.
Today, a proposal was published by the Government after the former Labor party lawyers, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments of the Government regarding foreign employees because they could be rejected by the neighbors.
‘Australian statements such as ‘Austrian’ and ‘Australians first’ are a very unappreciated removal in times where the workshops requested a workshop,’ she said to the India Institutes today.
Historyly considered that it said that white workforces should be spent – and if some in the region echos of this historyal artact would not be wonderful, I would not be wondered.
The proposal for the debate shall include twelve measures adopted by the former Imigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Imigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was going to talk about human fights in Sri Lanka last night, has implemented five of the recommended amendments that others are still increasing.
If the "reality criterium" is adopted, a person who requests a visa may be examined immediately if "the application is true in the cases where the applicant is related to the holder or person concerned of the undertaking."
Firms could also be binding to deal with the number of 457 video-inhibitors after they have set up only a small number of employees in the past.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old sri-lankic asylantic died proudly on a heart infarct after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Wednesday.
The preserved nine-year-old son of the man, who came after him, has been subjected to the death of his father in the middle of the middle of the middle of the ship of a wedding neighbor who was also on the ship.
The authorities held the man in the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British Government has been announced to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to achieve high speed connections between Scotland and North England at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Foreign Minister Barones Kramer said that the project will be "combined closer to the United Kingdom".
The Scottish Minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed bathroom connection between London and West Midlands.
After phase 2 ends, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government corrected the estimated costs for the building of the high speed road between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, which refers to the transport of Scotland, has ordered HS2 Ltd to seek further stream capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This belongs to the possibility of traveling for last three hours or less of Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our objective for HS2 is a real national stream network, which brings British and its cities closer."
We're going with HS2 because it brings great advantages.
Without it, we stand before a capacity crisis in our train network.
However, it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, Glassgow and Edinburgh, which is improved by HS2.
The Scotch State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "The present announcement is a message for Scotland."
In the name of the Scotch Government, Keith Brown Carmichael requested to be used "inconsciently" for the Scotch integration in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed bathroom connection provides the potential of great economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, the economic force of Scotland provides an argument for fast road connections throughout the United Kingdom."
Therefore, we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed bathroom connection in Scotland, the benefits for all, and the link of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scotch government has already planted.
I am pleased to examine the investigation report with the British ministers in the next year and to decide the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force temporarily
Flight passengers also need to continue to disable tablets and archphones on start and landing, despite efforts in the United States to lock the rules for such devices.
The American Federal Aviation Aviation (FAA) allows US airports to change their standards, so that passengers on their devices read, see or play videos during critical aircraft e-books, if they are in the "flight mode".
The majority of the flight is permitted to passengers this is already allowed, but many people find it dangerous that they cannot read their e-books when they start and land.
However, companies watch the decision to implement the United States aircraft companies of unemployment, but do not follow direct plans to amend their rules.
The aircraft operator CASA also explained that the notification would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions in the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were applied.
“The CASA has currently no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft” was rejected.
The subject provides provisions whereby aircraft companies should maintain security at any time and passengers should follow the safety guidelines provided by the cabine staff.
Virgin has already led to flights with the CASA negotiation on an extension of its Wi-Fi maintenance system and explains that it is open for changes, but that must be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices through the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer life after we now offer (free interviews) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas explained that there will be more than the current rules.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices can not be used at the start and landing, and we do not have plans to change it now," explained the company.
The FAA rules apply to US aircraft companies.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly consider the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
The decision is different in US companies after the age of the Flotte.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate the radio operations through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand-pack programs and customer teachings.
“When a flight company has made the tolerance of its float, it can pass through the use of tragable, easier electronic devices such as tablets, e-book reading devices and artphones at every height”, the FAA said.
In rare cases, in bad view, the crew will show the passengers while landing disable the devices.
The group also recommended to make more difficult devices in the start and landing safely under the seat or in the seats.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB attachers with light trailers were provided for a heavy scene in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced hard consequences.
Before Friday Game of Football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a weight - ton.
It was an inhabited, almost spending acustic, which was born to the viewer until shortly before the attack of the party game between the German Vizemeister Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park signal.
To hear, the guestfans were overwhelmed with their clusters.
The southern tribe, however, where the most faithful and soundest of the BVB-Fans are, represented extraordinaryly quiet: no shoes, no shopping calls.
The pot of the Capo, which coordinates the common inflammation, remained unemployed.
And in front of the tribe, it was only a big fashion with the title "Section Stadium Prohibition".
Only as a traveler Roman Weather Fields, as always as the first BVB player, the short-term jubel burned up.
When his family colleagues followed, there were sounds and worrying shales - but no longer everywhere.
In the central blocks, 12 and 13 of the southern tribe, nothing happened.
Moreover, the stadium speaker Norbert Dickel renumbered the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, winning over arsenal, prolonging the contract of Tra · Jürgen Klopp - did not provide feedback.
Only five minutes ago, the Capo revealed his potter - and the accurate effort to the right hands falls in a sound cry, when the dickel as a habitual demanded the vote on the rings in the stadium.
At last, the southern tribe was as always at the row, and finally, it was back here as the soundest place in the stadium.
And the latest time with anapiff from the southern tribe the sound request "Therbysier stands up" came, it was all again as always.
The weakness before was probably a reaction to the events of the last days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the lowest BVB adjuncts were found in the spectaculars and on the place - and nearly the rounds of Roman Weiden Fields.
The game was spent because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in the office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was an enormous event for the fans.
"The Ultra movement will give massive implications," announced the BVB Boss on Thursday on a Podium Discussion in Frankfurt.
As a measure, Watzke submitted Ultras a coregraphy for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've prohibited it," he said.
The Null Tolerance Policy in Pyrotechnic things can't be rejected.
Moreover, the Ultra has been shown different chances of punishing - until Thursday, these have now been time to decide for a decision.
Otherwise, so Watzke, the BVB will fix a sanction until the end of the next week.
"It's going to be incredible," safe Watch.
You can be stressed how the reactions on the south tribe then occur.
Pfandhouse trees in Singapore, since the crisis has arrived in the middle
In a pfandhaus in the purchasing seas in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga entered a golden armry, a ring and a few horrings to pay their daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, there's all my money in," Amirthalinga says.
Although she deserved 3.000 Singapore dollars (approximately 1.730 euros) each month as administrative employee, and her husband also works, the monthly family income does not expose it.
In fact, the request in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of the households increases – is so large that ValueMax, where she has made its exchange, has been the week of the pfandhaus listed at the Singapore Board.
It is not just a quick way to get money – 1.300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost like an unsecure bank loan.
Typically, pfand houses in Singapore require an effective 17-year period, which is only more than 15.4 Pro日, which requires the United Overseas Bank, a local credit provider with a share in the same purchase area.
However, Pfand Houses provide the benefit that there is no need for a review of creditability or income evidence, therefore the loans are more rapidly possible than in banks.
That is why millions of people in the region turn to Pfand Houses, after familys have the pressure by growing livehold costs and a sustainable budget and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis and profitable credits due to a lower financial policy in the developed economic areas, familys with small and medium-sized income income in order to compare the subsequence in a steady economy.
This week, the Rating Agency was a standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly by increased hypothecs, as a risk factor for the creditability of the Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have, after assessing the Agency, the maximum budget debt in Asia in relation to Brutto-Inlands product.
Malaysia is 80% of the PIB at the top of the list, a growth of 60% in 2008.
People's economy also are concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has nearly come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed an existing export weight and a follow-up of the consumer application.
“In the end effect, it means that the people will be trying to add their income, whereever possible, in the middle to lower segment (the income scale)," says Song Seng Wun, the economy of CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
History highests in the gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the tend to deal with personal objects, since people use the opportunity to convert family beauty to bargaining.
In Singapore there are about 70% of the deceased objects in the 200 pillars of the city's gold.
The people say: "The gold price looks good, let's make our grandmother's gold chain and take back the next month."
The largest Thailand Pfandh operator, EasyMoney, has in his owns a 20-proof customer growth in the last months.
The growth in the Pfand Business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the staff in the Bended Sea and 15 more in Singapore, wants not only to expand in the neighboring Malaysia – where the company is four houses – but also outside Asia, so Ja Lee Ching, business leader of ValueMax.
The company finances the 60% of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which adopted this week with the rental in Singapore.
Since some credit providers have been put into the cross-feeding, yes, that Pfand houses are not just more profitable than other suppliers, but also directly increased the debt.
The Commission states: "The ability to enhance the objects they already have, and the injury of personal values does not increase the budgetary balance," it states.
The financing of pensions will be accepted socially as a short-term, safe financing.
Not even all people who use painfulness are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the valueMax's holdings to deal with gold bars and Rolex hours, for which they get up to 60% of the purchase price in bar.
We've got customers from every social shit.
"This belongs to the well-being who take something shortly for a business or investment, or small enterprises that have to overwritten the engine in the Cash flow," says Yes.
Sometimes they just need very quick money.
NSA saves data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service Enth'er Edward Snowden has principle interest in helping Germany in the advertising of the always British NSA sphere business.
Following the presentation of the Green-Bund-Bundag Deputy Hans-Christian Strobele, there were surprising meetings with Snowden in Russia under which conditions the former secret service employees would be expressed at a German State manager or before an investigation committee.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, said Strobels to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Saving package over 325 million Australian for Tasmanian health
The Australian Government is on the hard conditions associated with the salvation package more than 325 million Australian for the Task Health Society in order to ensure that the Government of the State cannot dismiss the money.
The Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will be taken “inevitable measures” to deal with a crisis caused by an old population of the island, a quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasman Deputy Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has enhanced an emergency package that involves our view of the unique challenges that the Federal State has regarded," Plibersek said today.
The 325 billion dollar package includes 31 billion and immediately aid for election services.
More 2600 operations, orthopedia attacks and treatments due to green stars are to be removed.
Moreover, there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better insurance after stationary stays, training, psychical health services and the introduction of a system for electronic health records in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas of which clinical workers have told me that they are the best opportunity to improve the Tanya Plibersek health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Ministry was on a strict reporting and accounting commitment of the Tasman Government.
The Federal State must maintain the current financing level in order to get money from Commonwealth and report monthly where the interests were issued.
A three-country Commission will be established and shall ensure that the Federal State provides health services as effective and as soon as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million would only benefit if they were not associated with real reforms that lead to a sustainable more sustainable taxman health system.
Instead of this, he praised the Government that she had reacted to his request for an emergency assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in the beginning of May.
"I am convinced that federal aid will be granted a great contribution to take the public health system of the Federal State from the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the Federal State, these elections will lead to the recent implications.
However, the health policy speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's announcement is only a “flaster solution”.
"We are therefore in the situation today because the Labor State Government has removed 430 million of people from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It cannot be that a government is almost a half billion travelling from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million and then doing so as if it is the news.
Dutton requested Plibersek to ensure that no one of the salvation package will be issued for additional bureaucracy.

It has distorted its ability to produce chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
The global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday stated that there were difficult meetings in the north of the country near one of the locations in which most toxic substances are stored.
Similarly, on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people were killed from the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came on a day before the date of the date.
1 November, which has placed the organization in the Haag to make all the equipment for production of chemical weapons or "inoperable", all machines for the mixing of chemicals to gas and the compliance of munition.
The conclusion of this process, which is in fact the first level of the Zerseaction, is a major milenstein of a ambitionated schedule that aims to destroy all chemical weapons until the middle 2014.
The destruction of the entities means that no new chemical weapons can be produced anymore.
However, it must begin to destroy the existing weapons and equipment.
According to adoptions, there are approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including Senfgas and the Nervengas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday wars found in the city of Safira, the experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and stores, such as the seat of the observer of human rights in the United Kingdom.
The activist group who follows the number of dead through a network of activists explained that 120.296 people died on Thursday.
It was 61.067 civilians, 6.365 children.
On the sides of the Government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were Governing Friends and 187 Libanese Hisbollah Milizers.
Similarly, among the dead were 2.202 devastated armed data and 5.375 battles of opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100 000.
This number has not been updated until now.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels from which many associations with al-Qaida groups.
The observation site said that it had lost on Thursday on both sides, but it didn't call details.
The fights support the issues of the chemical weapons, since their mission to freedom from Property gifted weapons is a round against the time in the midst of a major civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is closely together with the United States, the team is “not convinced that it has seen all important production and mixture and mixture devices mentioned by Property and has meterle.”
Therefore, “no more inspections have been planned for the present time”.
In the beginning of the week, the inspectors claimed that they had completed the first part of the reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the places specified by Cuss.
As a result of security thoughts, the inspectors said that it was not possible for two institutions.
On Thursday, the OPWC, which were two places, stated by the Syrian statement “and which existing objects of the chemical weapons programme were reduced to other installations that were inspected”.
It was not immediately clear whether the sites in Safira were one of the two institutions that could not visit the OPCW inspectors.
There is a plan for the completion of its chemical weapons to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I am going to draw the hot before the tape and courage you have shown all in the fulfillment of the most urgent mission that has been carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Organization of Monitoring in a comment published by the OPCW.
Since three years, the primarily Sunnitic Muslim Rebells in this civil war against Assad's government and their security forces, which are many members of the Alavites, have been deployed by the Shit Islam.

The cause of the explosion is not, he explained.
Injury on the judgment of Bali bombing officers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 persons who had come to the bomb attack in Bali in 2002 reacted increasingly on the judgment for the last of the employees presented before the court because Omar Patek should be killed permanently.
Patek, who was nearly a year as one of the most visited people of South-Eastia on the flight, was condemned to his role last night in building snippets for the bomb attack to a prison penalty of 20 years.
He could be released with a restitution after 15 years.
The 45-year-old mass murder was found to be guilty because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist quarter of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88.
A commitment was also made in a series of terrorism-subject points, which included a variety of spending claims on churches in Indonesia at the weekend of 2000.
The State advocate had requested a long-term penalty, even if it had been for the man who was deceived as a master bomb builder as a "Demolition Man" who could have caused death penalty.
The decision has made painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost its 39 years old willing Jane and Jenny in the destruction of Patek and his companions almost a year ago.
She said that Patek should be condemned to death.
I really mean he should follow the footsteps of the other guys.
"Man should put it before a shooting order," Corteen said to the AAP.
I have to live every day with that I'm not gonna get any other uncle and I'll never see my daughters anymore.
The Sari Club was equal to the earthquake, when on 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 hours, a poor bomb exploded in a small laster that was parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in PaÃ©'s bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a self-smÃ©dnÃ¤lder was allowed to explode a ruck sack with spray.
After the attack, he fell into coma for a month and “dead” three times, while he went on a life-keeping system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same shick salle as the three other members of the terrorist Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Prim Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbad and were assigned four years ago.
In fact, this type should have the death penalty before all others.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and killed many hundreds of people, it is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber, which was before the court.
He arrived almost a year of prize, but in January 2011, s ́ was attacked in the Pakistanian town Abbottabad, where US trip forces killed the former al-Qaida-Chef Osama bin Laden.
In the case of the negotiation, a FBI agent explained that secret services reports had made the statement that Patek was in Pakistan to meet the aim of rebuilding the connection between South Tahitian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't sit," said Corteen.
In recent times, he has not shown a lot of suffering for others.
The sentence occurred before the annual year of the attack in this year, which will be held with memory feeds in Bali and Bali.
"There will be many trees this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still call against his judgment.
FAA: Flightests can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but no mobile talks)
Flighters can now hear their electronic devices to read, work, games, music and use the view of films, but not phone with the phone, as the new directives issued on Thursday of the Federal Aviation Aviation (FAA) to the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they would be implemented, from the relevant flight company, FAA collaborator Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The aircraft companies must demonstrate the FAA that aircrafts comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight staff and the arrangements for the deployment of the devices in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it had already received plans from some aircraft companies that wanted to build the use of driving electronic devices in aircraft.
These flight companies were also Delta and JetBlue.
"When we were in the state of the plan, we could accept the extensive use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in a confidentiality.
Currently, passenger artphones, tablets and other devices must be disabled when the airports are closed.
You can only start it again when the flight has reached a height of three miles and the captain gives green light.
When the aircraft comes into the country, the flightests need to disable them again and cannot start them again before the flight is landed.
In accordance with the new directives, aircraft companies whose aircrafts are insured against electronic screening could allow their passengers to use the devices also at the start, landing and on the roll field.
Most new aircrafts and other F.I.F., which were covered for the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights, should comply with the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flight Group, welcomed the amendments.
“If the new scheme is safe – and we are working closely with the flight company – both sides will benefit from it,” commented Glading.
We have honestly said that we have to feel as a supervisor in this subject.
However, Internet connections remained prohibited to surface, exchange of emails, text messages or downloads of data under three miles, the Authority reported.
Passeers are invited to move arcphones, tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
So no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble similar online game, which the vision player Alec Baldwin 2011 played on →Artphone when he had to leave an American Airlines Jet effectively because he refused to disable the device while the flight was parked on the flight.
And more difficult devices like computers have to continue to be discovered because there is a damage in this case if they fly through the cabine.
Mobile talks during the flight also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone talks is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA may have a prohibition for certain electronic devices at start and landing on
Last month, Mark Rosenker said of the National Transport Safety Board, national security experts for CBS News, phones would still be considered as a risk.
"Handy is actually a problem, not only because they could cause potential screening on devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also snippet the sendmasters," so Rosenker.
A consultation committee of the Branche, called by the FAA to investigate this subject, recommended that the Government allow a larger use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to locate restrictions for use.
Critics like the Democratic Senator McCaskill from Missouri represent the opinion that there is no valid security foundations for the prohibition.
The restrictions are also to be made much more difficult because the use of the devices has become global.
In some areas, the talk that has forgotten or ignored until a third of the passengers is disabled.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices through flighting, after reports on sprays of facilities and communications devices by passengers, UKW radios, which then represented the latest technology trend.
New aircrafts are weakly dependent on electrical systems as the former generator of aircraft, but they are also construed and authorised by the FAA that electronic interferences do not make them anything.
Flugglenies have offered passengers since some years of Wi-Fi when the airport has reached.
The FIF adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also incompatible with interferences.
The major majority of passenger aircrafts should be appropriate for the increased use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices are generally less radio radiation than previous generator.
E-readers, for example, only deduct minimum radiation if you are able to broadcast.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com includes the deterioration of the restrictions for the use of devices by passengers.
2011 Company workers invited a passenger aircraft full of childle E-Reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but they could not find it.
Members of the FAA-Batting Committee expressed mixed feelings, as regards the risk of use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger department National Propertyation of Airline passengers said he was thinking that the søjling by the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only adequate reports of pilots that speak for a breakdown of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA permit pilots to arrange the devices by the passengers under bad view conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and welcomed them as a reasonable adjustment to travelers that would have been fully equipped with technology today.
"We are glad that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger life is not in contrast to security," Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel.
Refreshed by air-service of Northern Sea-Bohr island salvated birds
An air-bearing service at the coast of the coast of a bird that was found on a Northern Sea island was released to the nature.
The water rail was last month with a shooter to Aberdeen’logs, where it was appointed by the Scotch animal protection organisation SPCA in their salvation center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, leader of the Centre, said: “This water rail was probably a winter bird from North Europe, which was stopped by the strong wind over the North Sea."
Apparently, the crossed bird looked for flight on the island of the bourgeois.
He added: “He couldn’t continue, therefore we were contacted with the request for help.”
When she was released, the water rolls were repeated and healthy.
Is Europe's Elite ready to make business with the United Kingdom?
Business for Britain was started in April with the aim of bringing the economy to a table and definition of what those who care for welfare and work in the United Kingdom want to change our relationships with the EU.
To this end, we have assigned the largest and comprehensive investigation of British economic leaders and asked them what they think of British, the Economy and the EU.
YouGov asked over 1,000 leader forces from the economy which represented the British enterprises, sectors and regions.
The results of the investigation will be very surprised.
We have discovered that the major majority of companies exports outside Europe and are able to make it possible to modernize and grow, while the countries in the EU are stagnizing.
They want to favorise new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil by Government, the long and urgent process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
As requested by certain legally regulated issues – from the right to the product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of these key competences should be restored to Westminster.
It was generally unconscious of the fact that the company's statement would overcome the costs of the brossel rules between the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40 percent of the large companies agreed to the traditional of the most European friends.
Sâ, and most of them probably say, our question of economic leaders said that a clear majority of the United States wants a course to change the Agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade.
This recognition, which is found in all sizes and leading concerns, shows that the economy is involved in a "sensitive change" that brings the degree of the operation back to the United Kingdom.
It is a lot – an amendment of the Agreement and a better conditions for the United Kingdom would lead to a change in view of the remaining in the EU in a national vote.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this question shows that the British Economy is a plan for the new negotiations of the British Conditions for the EU's Mediterranean.
It also shows that the enterprises expect a clear distortion of power conditions to the United Kingdom from a new negotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and at least necessary after the euro zone is now moved towards a stronger economic and fishing Union.
The priority must be workplaces and growth in the United Kingdom, as the result of our enquiry shows what is a strengthened view of trade and a fundamental change in the brosseling approach to rules for companies.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom bears Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasear
The beginning of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria is the beginning of one of the largest energy projects, explained Gazprom.
"The current event is a milenstein: Building work in the Bulgarian Section of South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and important project in Europe," said the president of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a cloud.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire continent.
South Stream will provide Europe for more time at Russian export routes.
A fight between Gazprom and its pens in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides a higher risk for conventional rounds, such as hearing from official side.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks linked to transit countries were "forever" disabled.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to profit taxes when the whole project is in operation 2015.
Gazprom says that building works in other successful countries will be started on the planned road at the end of the year.
The pipeline is exposed to an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of earthquake.

Consultation before the Queen Commission: two YMCA employees accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual delegates
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual delegates in relation to children before 2011 prejudices against the child manager Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were highlighted, as the Royal Commission experienced for sexual misuse of children.
YMCA, however, said before the Commission, “new had never been done in the organization with a case of sexual child abuse”.
Business leader Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA partner was accused of crimes with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was condemned for the misuse of children.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer who assisted the Commission, that he knew of the first case, but he did not know the second.
He concluded that the YMCA's evaluation claim was also unnew in the opinion of the Commission, “he has given external checks of YMCA, where YMCA was recognized as the first front of the child's security”.
Moreover, the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that he received the secondary assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, agreed that the business guide “after me” refused by the Lord's approval and did not ensure that the employees had been clearly informed of their commitments to report violations against the Child Safety Directives.
Lord was sentenced by the beginning of the year for sexual abuse of twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was condemned at least six years of prison.
However, Hare concluded that YMCA had a cultural problem that the worker had stopped to report Lord's crimes regarding the safety of children.
The workers claimed that they had observed crimes, including that Lord was only with kids, she was private as babysitters, let her sit on a shot, told one that he loved it, and left children playing with phones.
Danielle Ockwell, whose representative Lord, and who had requested a school for child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said that the Child Barnat leader Jcum Barnat, who was the representative Lords in YMCA Caringbah, “is very disappointed and most of the time was very inappropriate”.
The business leader explained that he would not accept the statements of employees, which would not have believed that they would replace their proposed report.
Instead, he said, in most cases, have affected their friendship with the Lord’s power of judgment, so they would not have informed him.
Hare explained that he notified the representative of YMCA NSW that the lection that the organization had to take from the "Jonathan Lord's incident" was "not referring to the report" by the employees, and the proposal was accepted to him.
Hare said that the decision to comply with the employees to sign secret holdings shortly after the accusations occurred was found by the Child Services Director of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should be prevented from contamination of evidence, but that has been “over-term” and wrongly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, no safe organization for children, Professor Stephen Allbone explained by the Griffith, expert for sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He highlighted that there were “primary problems” in the position, review, training, training and monitoring of the workers.
The consultation was discovered until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the opportunity to return as a British Prime Minister – but he agreed that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview today, on the fifth stage of his exemption from the office, the 59-year-olds announced its views of different internal policies.
Since retreat in June 2007 after a year as a Governing Boss, Blair has avoided largely expressing himself to British, and his comments are mostly limited to the external policy and its role as a leader of the quarter of peacemakers in the Near East.
The question if he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair from the Evening Standard from London was quoted with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that it has been done, so ..."
When the horse-show experts were found in a cross in Cardiff to get the horse of the year, they knew that a hard competition fight was intended.
However, no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirps, who has not yet been in the child garden and has made his first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee shot locker through the three wallets and took the first price – where they left 30 waxed enemies behind.
The insecure couple, both equally large, was loloted because of their occurrence, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is made by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he arrived in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had placed his tolerance in a fresh angle and led the two-year old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in the coming with the Pony, which was far over age.
And toffee received good notes for his arrival and his personality.
Fenton had received toffee last march as a gift to Âen birthday and exercised with the Shetland-Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great pressure."
They had to join the whole field of shareholders and went out with Goldpocal and Rosette.
It was just the second time he had shared with toffee in a competition, and we were all disappointed when he won.
Perfect strangers in the Arena felt him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the footsteps of his tite Sharon Howells, which has led horses for over age.
Howells said, "The whole public was as electricized and everyone was stuck and stuck it."
He walked on the sand all the lengths of the Arena, and even though he looked so vicious, he made fantastic work.
Fenton is foolish after animals – he lies horses, tractors and builders and has two kitchens that he cares for.
As he has started, it will not dure long until he is on the "Heir of the Year" shadow – and I'm sure he's going to be well cut off.
A speaker of the annual horse view said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how he should go with Pony."
They're a great team together.

Chinese magazine should be "reformed" after calling
A Chinese magazine requested on the title page for the release of a reporter who was accused to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The seatful New Express in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, in the television, Chen later admitted that he accepted payments to false reports about a national company.
Now the new Express of a "including reaction" will be understood, explained the regulatory auditor.
The ‘Rectieering Order’ came from the Press and Public Authority, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the new Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incompatible reports on the Boss noted company Zoomlioon between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editing management of the new Express was unordered”, said the regulatory staff in a claim.
She said that it was decided to "voke a administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and remove his reporting licence."
“the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been recommended to provide a complete reaction to the new express and recommended to identify the relevant responsibles in the new Express and immediately check the new express team.”
Chen had written several articles for the new Express, in which he reported about relevant financial irregularities in a producer of Baumakins, named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the magazine published two calls for his release on the title page and posted behind his journalist work.
However, then, Chen arose in the state TV and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have made Zoomlion a war, as well as all the news industry and their ability to gain the confidence of the public," he explained to the State messager CCTV.
I've done it first because I was out of money and honor.
I've become clear that I've done wrong.
In addition to Chens Excuse, the New Express published a excuse on the title page and explained that it was dismissed to check the reports correctly.
Miscellaneous contemporaries have latestly been released in television.
Experts say that guests are still increasingly forced, despite a change in law in the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited to force someone to accuse themselves.
Tunel with own railways between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most raffined tunnels for the swimming between the United States and Mexico, which was completely equipped with lighting, flexibility and electricity, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeter tonnels measured as one of the most disappeared passports that they had ever found.
The Tunnel, which leaves in the Zickzack pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, connects storehalls near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are numerous invisible storage rooms, which makes it easier to hide with loaded LKWs.
The tunnel was closed before transporting unrecognized, the authorities explained.
On the discovery of the tunnel, the records of the Court were guaranteed at the eighth tone of Marihuana and 148 kg of cocaine.
Three men who were charged by the authorities as a leader were charged for the property and the provisional sale of Marihuana and Kokain.
During a responsibility of a prison penalty between the years and the lifetime.
In Nogales, Arωνta, put smuggler on a broad sub-terrical network of dilution channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passport discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana sources in Central Mexico in October, which provides the cards for the challenge of bringing their product quickly to the consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a nearly 640 meters long passport with shoes that left from a kitchen in a wellhouse in Tijuana to two stores in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still loved
See players Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go futurely driving ways.
But in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are two-year Flynn parents.
Orlando Bloom has expressed himself to be trained by his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with the US journalist Katie Couric, which should be spread on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "The life sometimes doesn't leave exactly as we plan or hope it."
Kerr and himself still loved themselves, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will be subject to each other and love as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom are married since 2010, her son Flynn was born in 2011.
The Veganism is stated that Lexika is subject to the Vegetaryism, but it is different from this in a very significant way.
Because while Vegetarians allow the consumption of sahnetorts, iron or a strong edamer, these wounds do not stand on the map of a veganer.
Milk, kiss, egg, besides the disorder of meat and fish, the veganer leaves all animal products from consumption - also milk is denied.
Whatever remains, you can ask yourself, but in closer consideration, the villaine energetic world has a significant incidence.
"Broot upstream is very poly," Ute Henkelmann, the inhibitor of the hiesic reform house, which provides a number of special products for Veganers.
Also Reuben Proctor wants to visit the laden in the Domain.
Since 13 years of age, he's seen in Lampertheim, he's seen everything he has made for life. "I've killed my food and became vegetary."
In the centuries, the next step occurred, and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of the food, but because of the choice of shooting," says Proctor, the artist's leader's normal lender.
He recognized that it was also in other daily significances without animal products.
In the first line, Vegan is a ethic.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of the Veganers that are focused on all consumption behavior.
Instead of refreshing citizens, roads, or gumbernators, the Veganer has quickly discovered very new products, which has increased the disappointment.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, Vegan doesn't make any distress, no askes, but it's a area-reduction." The assumption that with the eating summary of food options, Proctor's choice is more likely to return to the power of the normality.
And exactly these conditions also allowed some of them to make such a well-mentioned trial.
"The search factor is a completely determining factor that allows many to leave quickly, similar to smoking," says Proctor a comparison.
And he calls: "There are not to be found in the animal."
Often, it is the warehouse or the type of preparation that makes the shadow.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor adds to a grill fest, for example, aubergines, champignons and also a few vegan worsts.
He takes care of an exhaustive, divorceous food, where it will also be sorrowful.
Of course, you want something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's gonna be funny, but it's not just to reduce animal nature," says Proctor.
He has not suffered healthy damage until eating, another broad adoption, he has not suffered.
For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.
I'm not taking a strange cholesterin and having an increased vitamin.
There are high-effective athletes that eat outside vegan.
"My blood values are best, I often let me check," says Proctor.
In addition to the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics are warned.
"The animals are enjoyed with food, instead of grassing on the wheat, it is wonderful whether in the meat that you buy in the cold truck, the vitamin B12 is high," Proctor finds.
For Veganers it also provides the possibility to take the Coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
The Proctor must not go through ways for the nutrition of food.
There are basic foods everywhere, and every super ́ has average sojamilch and other products.
Everything I need, I'm going to find out.
Just get out and buy something special.
"Most people think that only the finished products are fair, but it also relates to "usual" finished products."
Without preparation of vagan courts, it is much more favorable and less timely than accepted in general.
"In the housebuilding there is much to discover, with a few small kitchens you can do if you don't get partly better results," Proctor says.
Margarine placed Butter, a little more back powder and coal acid placed eggs, with his vegan kitchen, Proctor also could bring his swimming powder.
The Veganer's family festival provides a new wheel.
That's a dynamic, when you buy together, it's a new place value.
"The situations that can occur are as different as people themselves," Proctor says.
Of course, but he has already been given scepsia.
Doesn't my eat go to you anymore?
"Will I feel bad now because I have milk trigger?" -- in such questions, you must act as a veganer with fingerprint feeling.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to expire.
And more accurately, the world doesn't seem to be as deceived as it is, and the Veganer does not be limited as all day as accepted by the community.
More fast food is allowed.
There's pommes everywhere!
"Several dance members offer Falafel, or even a vegetary yufka," Proctor says.
In a piιοria, he weighs on past courts, or commands a pizza without cake, everything a question of normality.
The restorations are so quiet about it.
"When I started to eat me Vegan 13 years ago, it was still much weaker," the new country can find a development: "You have to talk to people to take care of them."
"If there are enough questions, they may be able to add the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, for example, the combustion in Manheim or the café free of birds.
Proctor insists that other restaurants have at least a vegan court on the food card.
In fact, Wedney's judgments for everyone there are.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"The meat judges are, however, exclusive, and in the true sense of the word, because they end others," Proctor states.
"If you want to avoid food channels, Veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part of the front," Proctor says.
But the purchasing of vegan products may be something difficult at the beginning.
In particular, when you learn to understand, which also contains animal additives as color providers in the earth, it seems to be quickly abandoned by following the ethics in so many shops and falls.
Not only therefore, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganumo - animal contents and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are used to purify.
"Near and after you develop a scanner view and know what characters and logos you have to look at, "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay or to be stolen," says Proctor.
The Veganism, he's a major moral fingerprint that takes the knowledge.
Maybe he doesn't make it completely possible to reject his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to ask his habits critically.
Nasdaq OMX's officer continues to keep his customers in spirit.
The trade in Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday Wednesday.

The British Police provides asange a consignment of delivery
Today the British police has granted a delivery notice to WikiLeaks-ground Julian Assange, who looked for refuge in the ecuadorian message in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that it was given to the 40-year-year-old "invitation to make himself" that requested him to appear in a police guard, and that he should not follow him, he should not be arrested.
Assange, the delivery to Sweden because of the accusation in a sexual department, after its possibilities have been issued under British law since the Master Court of Justice has rejected its commitment against the delivery of the beginning of the month.
Since he cared that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he searched for refuge in the ecuadorian message in London on 19 June and asked the South America country for a political asylum.
Scotland Yard gave “a 40-year-old man a request to put on one of us selected time at a police guard”, explained a speaker.
He continues to lose the conditions of his release on the cution.
The message did not give any comment to submit the police request.
Assange fears that the Swedish is delivered to the United States and accused him for the possibility of spying, after he had published more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks Enthing Website.

Tax for foreign immobility owner against London's speculation blase
The Financial Ministry has temporarily calculated the CGT action, but still waiting for the final decision of the tax officer George Osborne, who in 2012 had decreased a rate of 7 per cent of apartments costing over two million pounds and annual taxes for buyers that hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Now the income from the stamp tax for property in the areas of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which lay up 708 million pounds in 2012/13, together the rescue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northwest, Northwest, Yorkshire and the region Humber.
Cook said: “With the increases in stamp tax on high-precious apartments and the introduction of the legislation against a consequence, it is difficult to say that high-valuable immobility is too low, notwithstanding the impact of the foreign community tax system.”
“And this step could make some of the foreign investors retaining the purchase of immobility in London, or holding the owners of it,” he added.
The first classic immobility – the main five-to-year pro of the apartment at Price – in the southern west of Londres, which was extended from Fulham to Wimbledon, has decreased the record value of 11,8% in the last year.
The prices in Central London showed an equivalent annual growth of 5,6%, but a streaming "Inlands" was overcome in which the southern part of the city, northern (7,4%) and the East (6,5%) experienced a survey of Savills.
Agencies were able to broke more light on how the sweet wheel of a dog is with its vote.
Earlier research has shown that happy dogs shared more to the right (of the sight of the dog), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now, the prosecutors say that other dogs can observe and respond to these subtile subdivisions.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurologist of the University Trient, said: “In humans it is good that the left and right brain helps are different to Stimuli, the positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs exactly as in humans, the right brain help is responsible for the movement of the left side, and that the two hemisphers played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side of their arts, researchers watch the animals while these films of other dogs are watching.
They measure the heart frequency of the fourth and analyze the behavior.
We'll probably understand soon why the weight moves to the one, once in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs — either a naturally cruel version or a silhouette to eliminate other declining aspects, and so we could control the movement of the weight more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how a other unexpected dog moved the wheat to the right (from the perspective of the deceased dog), they remained completely disappointed.
But if the swimming was primarily left (which is from the perspective of the dog, the heart frequency increased, and they looked insufficient.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate with each other by these movements.
Moreover, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should be concerned and won't.
He said: “If you have different meetings with other dogs and weakening with the weakness is better linked to friendly behaviour and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, you are responsible on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners, animals and trainers could help to improve understanding of their animal emotions.
John Bradshaw, expert for dog behavior and guest stipendiat at the University of Bristol for Animal Health Factory, explained that this wasn't the first stage in which it was investigated whether left and right for dogs is important.
Last year, a team of the University of Lincoln discovered that the dog turns the head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and rightly when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following states: “They are better going to a robot, if it is "Schwanz's left divorce and not right to be insufficient – just different than in the Italian.”
According to his statement, the subsequences could therefore touch that the dogs in the different areas did not interpret the animals in the movies or robots as dogs.
He explained how dogs respond to true dogs could help.
“Why there are significant claims for many different seeds that the two brain halfs are used for different purposes, but many of the details need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," so Bradshaw.
Since their behavior is simply up, it is probably not long until we understand, why the weakness is sometimes moved into the one, sometimes in the other direction.

Papst Franziskus referred to in February, first Cardinale
Papst Franziskus will first be called new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican gave on Thursday.
Cardinales are the most added clericers in the Catholic Church after the father and they are also who choose a paper, so Frances will call the first group of men who will finally be involved in the choice of his follower.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal, who has reached a 80-year-old, can not share in the paper station – that is a group of 120 "elected cardinales".
In a cluster in which the message was given, Pater Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, will be located a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremonie will be held for the name of the new cardinals, which are also as a conscitorium.
"Papst Franziskus has decided to give his decision to the conscitorium in February before, so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all the world may be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals will probably be seized until February.
He explained that a paper normally named so many cardinals as needed so that the number of electoral cardinals would be 120 again, and so many cardinals more than 80 as he wanted.
Therefore, the Council is important in the next year because it is the first thing since the election of Francisco in the market this year, so Valero.
Currently, there is a certain overall of Europe, and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new father will call the cardinal from the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty pros of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a profitable number of cardinals.
The Cardinales will also be the first ones who will be called since the French Cardinal Council's education to find a group of eight cardinals from the whole world who have the mission to find opportunities for the reform of the church.
In the past, the dad was all away alone.
"Now Frances has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was “good possible” that Francess requested the cardinals for the Council.
But until now we weren't in this position – that's all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically call from large places to cardinaals, but the French stack “full surprises – so we don't know who he calls”.
GM calls new pickkup trucks in the United States to repair the seats
General Motors calls nearly 19.000 of his new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup tracks with Bühr 2014 to address a problem with the manually prepared seats, such as a notice of the U.S. regulator for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there can be a defect in the mechanism to restore the pre-seats.
Therefore, they do not comply with the Guidelines for Vehicle Safety in the head.
“If the vehicle is on the back, it is possible that the heads do not spend the insects correctly, so there is an increased damage” was reading in the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Propertyation (NHTSA).
The returned models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM-tracks began in June and set the main model start of the US leader car manufacturers since the 2009-based restructuring.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first October half of the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notice writing because of the 16-day Government Shutdown, which was negative to the car sales in October.
The sale of silverado and Sierra-tracks, renewable for the 2014 model year, was spent in the early 20 months of the year, and GM explained on Friday.
In October, GM 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup-Tracks.
The GM action increased by 1,4 Pro in the New York Börse to 37,47 US dollars on Friday Wednesday.
A obama chooser's wrap cry
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made praiseworthy efforts which have been denied by the blockadectics of the Republicans.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's web site problems, the drug attacks
Obama's memories on the 2008 election battle were a painful memory of what was possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm reading a terrible triumph book now.
It's a book from which I believed that it would rebuild me during the second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” (the mut to win) and skilds the Barack Obamas memories to the presidential election 2008.
If I'm done tonight with my patients' nicknames and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the millions inspired and one talk could go up to the spirit.
The choice was held to a earthquake and the news speaker to lead the historical importance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the road to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
In 2008, when Obama changed to office, he had 82 % agreed values.
And then I'll close the book.
To turn again to the present, it is a bad wake as if you are thrown out of a dream.
It seems hard to remind these optimistic times – they seem to be a weak reminder, a painful warning of lost opportunities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could imagine.
I recognize the great and multilateral things that Obama has reached from the delay of the Affordable Care Act for Sicurance to the military decline from Iraq, the end of the disturbance of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the partipolitical blockadetactics have covered too many efforts with which our nation should be predicted: immigration reform, public option for hospital security and the closing of Guantanamo Bay to be called only some.
However, after I have defensed the government of Obama against colleagues and known ones, I have been at the end with my claiming attempts.
I have reached a point of political dilution.
The Republican Blocade Policy cannot declare why it is permitted to hear outside national heads or to kill innocent children by overseas.
It cannot be explained why the National Security Agency collects data about the life of Americans and is punished by whistleblowers that open the state's misbehavior.
It cannot be declared why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American State citizen, has been murdered without procedures, and why the public financing and department limits will be passed during the presidential elections.
It does not justifie the results of a report, which means that the efforts of the White House to relax the media are the "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon Government".
And at the latest it cannot excuse the incapacity to create a simple website for more than three years since the discharge of the Abfordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
If I should have understood that the government work could resist its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Deputy Board is not a predictable course, since a opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown Massacher are discussing public discussions.
But if I see the above examples, they seem to be highly chosen by the Government.
And that's the most of me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was pleased with his candidate.
Meanwhile, Romeney made a confusing and unexpected alternative that he seemed not to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second official time for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard for so long.
However, with the sensation of the approval values for Obama to be less than 45% this week, the return has become so harder in 2008 by this book.
It surprises in me the view of the many promises that have been solved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had to put a severe loss against Clinton at the prevalences in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his employees that they should return to the course and follow their purpose.
"I want us to find our bottle again," he said.
We must notice who we are.
It's five years later, Mr President, and I can't accept you stronger.

Clive Palmer claimed that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had interest conflict in parental authorisation
The billion and lawyer Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental vacation because his daughters were pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mountainbaumagnat, which is in a legal settlement on the payment of 6 million € to CO2-speed, replied that he wanted to exchange questions from the table whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mountains are controlled or shorted.
However, Palmer claimed that only Ministers could have interest conflicts and that the daughters of Abbot would benefit personally from the laws.
“He is in a great conflict of interest when it is payable for parents' vacation, because if one of his daughters are pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives or does not,” said Palmer.
Two months after the choice, the election committee Palmer, with 53 votes Vorsp, explained after the renumber officially to the winner of the Sunshine Coast site of Fairfax.
Palmer requested a review of the voting process so that it would be quickly off.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Whether these elections should be decided two months after the end of the vote delivery?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system in which you can enter the data into a computer immediately, and then have the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of bleeds when marking the voice tables.
Do you use them because you can raise the results if they don't like one?
It is incredible to vote with bleeding feet today.
The election Commission has examined the options for a electronic election and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that it belongs to a international aircraft for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office very seriously.
In a public office, it is about the public service.
"We are trying to do any recompense other than the story, which is that we can serve in a critical time of this Community," he said.
RBS suspended two devisen handlers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two employees from their devise department, as well as two persons trusted in the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide public investigation of the mutual manipulate manipulation racially takes a journey.
Some of the most largest banks in the world, UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, have assessed that they cooperate with the authorities in the world's largest financial set on 5,3 billion US dollars daily.
The two employees would be the first RBS workers suspended in the extensive investigation that the Skandale follows the Libor Interbank Business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspension, made this month a view that it received information requests from the authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fullly with the FCA and other regulatory members," the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last months the situation stated that the RBS sent the records of e-mails and Instant Messages sent by and to a previous operator to the British supervisor, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This operator, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and had to be authorised by its current position as a leader of the Forex-Spot Handling at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, leader of the Spot Trading at Citi, was allowed this week and Matt Gardiner, former leader of walls at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No such operators have been misbehaved.
Instant Message Group of Usher, bankers belonged to Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation of nearby persons.
UBS presented this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator Finma explained that she had examined a mutual manipulation of the Devises in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competitive Weko, the FCA, the US Justice Minister and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently occupied with prejudices to which bankers should have been dispatched on transactions in the field.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said trusted persons with the situation.
Banks cross the Instant Messages and E-mails from several years in search for cases of failure.
The news about these investigations has placed the employees in a area in emergency that has heard in the last years to one of the most profitable trade units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currency limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have attempted to play the business and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and high-graduated liquid devises, but leaders believe that this is not really true.
A leader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume in the devisen trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trade platforms and the lasting use of their own internal platforms by banks leads to “the market with very small ticket prices”.
The message came out on the same day, when Credit Suisse had given, she announced this week a vendor of its London Exchange Traded Funds office after he had caused a loss of nearly six million.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and → with them.
"We are sure that the vendor has handled himself and that the matter has been invoked," Credit Suisse said.
The building on the Bechtle basic piece
A group of citizens of the "Switzerland Wiese" initiative has broken the building on the Bechtle-based basket on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.

The planned coverage of the cracking house in the back of the basic piece was not allowed from security reasons, because the land is going to break.
Alfred Abel, who managed the basic stage, has been discussed by the BI with colleagues Reinhard Domke.
Before the action of the BI, a transparency was introduced with the message "We have been here."
However, the 20 members of the citizen's initiative were few in their action.
His moto on the big place called "We are against Bauruin".
This is what she wanted to indicate on the still greater ruins on the Swiss Wiese - it should break the riesen project one day.
In conversation with many passengers before the "building", it was clear that some citizens believe that it will be better with the realization of the town project, although not few have the same issues to the dimension of the project as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city continues to pass these answers, it is from the BI.
As it was to hear, the public expressions of the citizen were also affected.

Rangnick School for chirurgicals: There are no kings of whale
Ralf Rangnick is so satisfied with the current form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so the Sport Director of the "Bullen" of the Courts.
"There is currently an annual tendence that Mane and Alan will be joined into the Category of Swavel Kings," he took the two officials on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The youngest advice for Rangnicks Critics was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Green on the last Sunday, when the senegale was a famous player for destruction - which was freely not like the TV images shown.
"A crazy failure decision," said Rangnick, the courtyard Harkam was "forwarded".
Harkam would also be "her part" to scale between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Green-Trainer Adi Holder after the party.
His German landsman defended: "I would have behaved in any situation like Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with colleagues Geha.
I didn't know why.
"When I am the one who was wise," the 46-year-old stated.
In view of the successful course, Rangnick accepted a lobeshymne.
"There are only two words: right good," he stated.
It's not much to exhaust.
In particular, the way the community plays is impressive.
That's what it's going to do.
The changes in the winter transmission period will not be possible.
There are no wonderful reasons to change something.
"Besides a player takes the desire he wants to leave the union," Rangnick explained.
Supreme Court occupied Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Government of Obama: The US Supreme Court has discovered today that the health law linked to Barack Obama is constitutive.
With five to four voices, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – the US citizens are forced to conclude a hospital insurance until 2014, or to punish a penalty – is constitutive in the framework of the State's tax performance.
The chief judge John Roberts shot on the side of the four liberal members of the room, while the judge Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also examined the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the whole law and concluded that the standard of the health law, whether the Federal States should extend the conditions of access to medicines or other public medical adoptions, should not be constitutional.
The proceedings against the law were entrusted by 26 federal States and the National Federation of Index Business.
The Law was rejected by all leaders of the Republican presidential candidates, the last executive Midt Romney, in the pre-elected battle of 2012.
Norway: Norwegian place is made with rice reflection light
With big spikes, the inhabitants of a Norwegian east have brought light into its dark valley.
As a result of the low sun incidence, the Rjukan located in the Westfjord number of Herbst to Frühling usually in the shadow of the round mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters height, a middle-week dream was true.
"End!", heavy citizen Steinar Bergsland at the start-time of the television sender2.
Some inhabitants of the wallets rejected sunsets, others set up the middle of the sun.
In the winter, solar winters had to go to a nearby wheel.
Age ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to link the streets with spikes into the valley.
But this basic idea was already in place since 1913.
After multiannual debates, the town Council had implemented the project of the 5 million crowns (approximately 615 000 euros).
Similar construction has produced the Italian Alpenort Viganella winter sunlight since some years.
Email is no longer empty on Sunday
"Most citizens will not have not yet noticed that the red points for Sunday Learning are still at the different letters of the city and the city parts, but reading the small printed to the white containers of the Post AG, you can quickly find that the emptyness of sun and holidays is no longer placed," the FDP shares.
A request from the FDP has made this.
On Sun and Festivals, only before the post building in the Serious Ludwig Street 36 and in the Jacob-Mère-Street 1 is cleaned in the tent field.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is cleaned even Sunday, the response to the request of the FDP will not be answered.
The social and youth political speaker of the FDP, Fritz RÃenbeck, wants to be here.
The Sunday Learning is just a important post service at the date post.
"These subscriptions are radical and unmotivable, despite the increase of prices for letters in January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, the President of the Liberals Groups and City Foreigners, supports his colleagues: "What threats me is the fact that there is a secret change of training time or also deterioration."
From nearby citizens, the post is remote in the mile.
"It must at least clear the letters in the town parts Newlock and Rosen Garten again on Sunday," so Bittner and RÃenbeck unisono.
In addition, for the nuclear city, especially not mobile citizens should have been able to get a letter card with Sunday teaching.
Rõenbeck asked in the town parliament whether the town management talks are planned with the post on this matter.
Master Erich Maier answered, the post has not communicated with Lampertheim.
However, in Hofheim, it also gives a Sunday teaching.
Its party has already spoken for Implementation.
"Then decisions are taken in another place," said Mayer.
Frankfurter Parking Countries will increase strongly
Parks in Frankfurt might soon be more sensitive.
The town's magistrat today speaks about a presentation of Ver·szernent Stefan ́er (Green).
This is why the parking trains should be increased by 50%.
However, the prices should not be highlighted, but the time range of parking and parking cars should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the assembly of representatives of the city must be decided.
IHK Frankfurt's individual trade committee holds this "for no idea".
The possibility of parking directly before the business is "unprecedentable benefit for smaller experts".
The transaction club of Germany is the opinion that a growth after two years is "adjusted and longer overcome".
The public Nahverkehr will also be theurer.
Rejoice City: Quick action overcome guest providers
With a slight frame, Mrs I of the TSV city of joy in the Schiller-Cultural hall had to join the TG Gunningen from the Swedish Alb.
Although the elbers were with a experienced community on the other website.
But soon it showed that they, even old-conditionally, couldn't completely maintain the rapid actions of the rejoicing staff .
With the hard and located reliefs, the gains were very difficult.
Repeatly, they lost the feet and attacks of Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz purely played over the network media and were not at the blocking.
Two highly high-satured wins are clearly the overcome of the places of joy in all importances.
In view of this impressive and playing performance, the seat was then won something slightly and unleavened at 3:0-outstand (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).

TSV joy city I: Dominik Böuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second groups of Baiers sources and the city of joy stood in the Murgtalhalls in Baiers sources.
They offered a heavy fighting two hours-ma.
Nervecy on both sides caused, in particular, errors and point gifts when balling; in the pass, the precision was adequate manageware and in some critical game scenes, the overseer prevented the choice of possible point wins.
In this efficiently balanced meeting, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, but through the large corporate use and a satisfactory commitment of both teams.
Pleasure day at the small engineering support
In the middle of the fifth weekend, in the follow-up of the Natura 2000 project of top hotzenwald, a group of employed participants met in the small English household in Ibach.
On the basis of the recruitment of the population, this day, in the area of the tent of the cock, should be released into the valley, Mr Helmut Kaiser said.
Â Wanderers, such as the Caiser, had this area as the Square of the Flight Step, on which the landscape offers the ideal frame for beautiful views.
He thanked the presents for their preparation for cooperation and stressed that the holiday was a suitable tool to strengthen human and natural connection.
He offers to every citizen the possibility of putting actors in nature himself.
Similarly, with the tourist aspect, the environmental consideration can also be found.
This environmental aspect was found by the Department of Natural Protection of the Government Presidency of Liberburg, as a result of the welcome by the Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken the screen governance and wanted the action to be appealed.
The tourist goal of the Watchtower is to be covered by Tribukait with the goal of obtaining the highly grown old general west field with its specific types of living rooms by opening and connecting to the still existing vessels.
Specific species such as rare smileys and grasshouves can't overcome barryers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free connections to maintain.
Tribukait said she wouldn't want to dismiss it in this place to break a lance for the planned biosphère area.
In this plan, the current measure is not only added.
A biosphere area also provides the possibility of sustainable economics, such as environmental development based on the internationally recognized Unesco status, and thus a continuous completion of the future achieved with the life project and the current caredays.
According to these various exhibitions, Revier leaders Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the assistant in groups.
The largest trees have already been shot in the case, the forestlepper will be ready to call.

In 2011, Google delivered a starting order over 900 million € for the Nortel Patents.
Google increased his boat several times and offered too late €4.4 billion dollars.

Egypt prevents the first freely selected presidents
Mohammed Mursi defers the office, but his day of triumph cannot mean the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi spoke a “new Egypt” when he was determined as the first electoral president of the country and thus adopted the follow-up of Husni Mubarak, who was extermined from the office for 16 months ago.
With his mandate before the Master Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth country overseer of Egypt since the monarch's round about 60 years ago.
He sent the sweet before the 18 judges of the court clothed in black robots, which had his seat on the Nil, and was found in an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the festival ceremonie that lived in the state TV.
“The Egyptian people today have set the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brothership, a fundamentalist group, which has been adopted mostly as a prohibited organization of the respective government since 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and cops watch the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoi shortly after eleven hours.
Only a few hundred attachers had gathered before the court to join the new president, and in contrast to the president of Mubarak's time, the construction was held only shortly so that the carkonvoi could overcome the usually covered road that was connected to the city's area with the southern frontiers.
As an uncharismmatic "replace" of the brothership, his personal Prestige has increased since Vig and a Friday word, not only as the Islamic candidate, but all of those who wanted to take the efforts of the rebellion from 2011 against the authoritary Mubarak.
“Egyptus is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state”, explained the judges in the wooden wooden room in a blue tissue with red white clothing.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Kairo, where he should keep his approach speech.
He was often welcomed by an army capelle that played the national hymne he listened to.
The military leader of the field marchal Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the largest hearing room of the University with speakers of “The Army and the people are a hand. ”
The University of Kairo, created in 1908 as Bastion, developed to a islamist group of students in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi sent a symbolic swear on the Tahir place, the birthplace of the rebellion that last year led to the end of the authoritary rule of Mubaraks, and he promised to repeat preliminary powers that the military Council had taken from the office.
However, with the derogation of the official egg before the court, and not as usually before Parliament, he calls on the will of the military, which indicates that the power fight will continue.
Mursis Tale on the Tahir place was full of dramatic popular gestures.

Foreigners in South Africa: two-time life-life detention
Nine months after a 17-year-old girl's brutal administration and divorce in South Africa, the dairy was condemned to two-time life-life.
This was reported by the sender SABC.
The victim later died on the consequences of serious damage.
John Kana was already found in the beginning of the week of crime for responsibility.
The fact has been resolved in the country.
At that time, the 21-year-old Anene Booysen had managed in February in a industrial campaign in Bredasdorp near Capstadt.
14 hours, however, the physicians deal with the survival of the victim.
The view of young people was so deceptive that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had been granted during the process, in fact night with booysen in a bar.
He also felt that he had killed and managed them, but he decided to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had been out of several teases before, but two convinced that the evidence had not been sufficient against them.
The State advocate also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that Canada was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, there are almost almost all day-day exhibitions: Annually, there are about 64,000 shows for sexual violence.
These are almost so much as in Germany, but with 82 million people are clearly more residents than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women associates in South Africa appreciate the dark numbers of sexual violence at 10-25 times.

Did you think travel offices belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its benefits for the whole year and expects records of vacants in the United States and the United Kingdom.
The travel undertaking now comes from a balanced annual profit from taxes between 325 and 340 million, compared to 305 to 315 million in its previous prognose.
If the current target values are achieved, it means a growth of 12 to 17% compared to 290,4 million in 2011/12.
As the business leader Graham Turner had given, the flight center reached eight Pro± wins in the first half year and was a strong start in the second half year, especially in the Australian and British business.
"From the beginning of the year, our countries are profitable and some of them are on the way of recording year's income from prices and taxes," he explained.
This belongs to British and Great Britain, which typically belong to our highest results.
The free time industry in the second half year has been obtained, which is a lighter market for business travels.
Similarly, it was good for the free-time business of the Flight Centre in the United Kingdom, while the business offices were less exposed here.
The US work was renewed to the first half-year weakest season condition, so a winning for the year after the year is expected.
Actions of Flight Centres increased by 3 cents to 38.20.
Schools are kept to greater focus on Mathea, spelling and gram
In courses to English literature, students have to bear at least one part of Shakespeare, a Roman of the 19th century, romantic Lyrik and modern British Romans since 1914.
In the test, there are also “unvisible texts” input to raise a widespread reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is removed.
From 2015, students have to carry out an individual GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will be published tomorrow in the new teacher plans for English and Mathea – the first feeds that have been radically converted.
Other nuclear boxes will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual will provide a new organisation of GCSE structures, a new notation system and less course work.
In a speech in Summer, Michael Gove said that there is a "widely consensus that we need to reform our test system to restore the public confidence", and he stressed that the GCSEs would be "require, ambitionate and stronger".
Showing that in English schools it is used less time for Mathea – 116 hours per year or three hours a week per year – than in most other countries.
During that time, Australian schools study a average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
If there is no formal request to provide more time for Mathea in the hour plan, but from coalition circles it means that the comprehensive mathematical verification – combined with a higher weight of the professional in Rîistis – will probably encourage schools to put more hours.
In the teacher plan, more attention is given to “the problems of the right life”, Property Finance.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the ecumenian speaking forum
At the next ecumenian speakforum on Monday, 21 October, in the new museum of the closses, it is the subject of the "Zur Häe with the HÃe - theological reviews for today's negotiation with the last things".
Referencen is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenian Practic Forum is a initiative of the Catholic and evangelical church community Salem, the closses Salem and the cultural sequence of the earth.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow the question in the forum, how people today are invoking the "Latest things" after death.
If the people in the past centuries have been too much knowing about it and put on those images of heaven and Heaven, "they make up our imaginations until today," the modern prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion is more likely by a certain occasion or an uncleanness.
"The greatest hope is that Christian and Christians have been executed by religious critics," says the Referencerin.
"We've made so many wonderful signs that we've seemed to have the vocational signs."
Johanna Rahner continues to say, "And the decisionful challenge remains the threat of death."
This is a connection with the question after that sex, "which dreams that at the end all can be good."
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at Albert-Ludwigs University Freeburg from 1982 to 1989.
She promoted 1997 to Dr. Theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for fundamentalal theology and ecumenic theology followed the Western Wilhelm University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has introduced a teacher for systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of University Kassel.

Two juneors of the German Spitch class were also at the beginning in this legal battle: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Trubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of places at the German Masterships.
These both were able to get out of the field expected.
Like in the previous year, Felix Bader could save a small time prespective to the goal and defend his title as a whole of the short distance.
In two places, Pascal Treubel could be replaced.
In the ladies there was Theresa Duelli from the Albtraum team, which made it completely up on the winners.
In two and three places, Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the largest number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only about the performance capacity, the whole band width was represented in sportlers.
In addition, the age structure has been over 70 years in the oldest starters.
In the main round, more absolute topalettes were at the beginning in this year.
Four drivers were able to stop from the regional shopping drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a Mountainbike helpprofit from Black-Tusk-Racing team.

In road through swimming, fluid and jungle for free medical supply
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical assistance in apart villas in Camerun
Bwelle and his team lead almost every week to treat hundreds of patients
In the Western African country there are no many doctors, only one for 5.000 people.
vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other held in the top 10 to select him to the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George's Bwelle saw how his sick father always lost his knowledge and traveled to hospitals that did not overcome the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was killed in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the main city of Camerun.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then it became a burning that extended himself to his brain and caused a hematome that should affect him for the life of his life.
"There were no neurochirurgs in Camerun," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money getha.
Instead, Bwelle spent years to join his father in overfed clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five hours tomorrow and run to the hospital to be the first, and it is not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has never changed since Bwell's father died since 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one ar for every 5.000 people, so the World Health Organization.
In addition, the relationship in the United States is at an ar for 413 persons.
But even if there is an ar for them, most cameruns couldn't be allowed to make it possible.
Two of five people in the country live under the poverty border and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is the poverty," says Bwelle.
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his people suffered in Bwelle allowed the decision to take something against them.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer office have done 700 free operations in the last year.
He himself became Ar and 日 as a feast chirurg in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
✔ He found a useful organization called ASCOVIME that travels in rural areas and offers free medical provisions.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, and up to 30 people are in small buses and walk with the screened medical equipment on the cotton over an unconstituted territory to the villages that need help.
It doesn't always leave everything freely.
More than once, they had to move the vehicles through rivers and slims.
But when they come, they will receive as herds: a festival, an aggregate and dance and the best delivery that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical supply is actually a reason for celebration and bowls – with wide lakes and its free energy – is pleased in the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We'll treat 500 persons," Bwelle.
They come from a circuit of 60 miles to the village – and to the foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical supply in a number of areas.
People are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, undergrounds, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others receive tickets, spent brilliants or free birthtimes – a document that is needed for school, but many poor families can simply not be allowed.
The team makes simple operations with local disorder.
The operations usually are located in a school, a ratio or a apartment; after the entry, the patients stand up and go into the recovery area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the deinfection facilities is reflected by the group's generator and thus works Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a stressing pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They're throwing the whole night to stay wake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will return to the city, silence, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixing of Cameroun doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations in the last year and knows that, with their work, it has been a huge distinction for people who help.
One man explained that the free operation of a service break that he received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as Chirurg in the hospital, Bwelle also night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his profitable activity, such as Bwelle; it is part of the private S.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studys in the second year at the Drexel日 in Philadel and volunteerly studys in Bwell's group with.
He is always at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and hospital students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and submit Bwelle, this is a chance to collect practical experiences that they would never get home.
"We can be in operations where we can help to pull blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
This would never be possible in America as medical student in the second year.
Students normally pay their travel to Cameroon and often carry out healthy materials.
But if they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes the delivery, transport and guide.
"He's without doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people does not know limits.
For Bwelle, the nearly permanent work is not charged.
Helping others to a more happy life and to fulfill a promise that he has given to his Father makes him a great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laughing and slow down the pains.

Exhibits the war holder
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut down on the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hate in Property meter, the art of the show.
The old man Santiago can not form anything on fishing.
So these two are simply great.
It is almost thought to see the falls in the neck of the old man, of whom the fishing manolo speaks.
If Santiago's mourning from life is sitting on the throne, it's really in Janson.
The role of the old fisher is also through a character role that Janson excites.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who doesn't abandon and finally through his own and also his willingness wins the fight against the fish.
Janson's in a big line as a single manufacturer on the boat.
He can focus the attention of the public on himself so that his monology is not long-term.
His efforts to finally drag the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the surveyers forget that the sea is only from blue-lighted water flames.
Regissor Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to act in the ship before the fisher Dorf.
During the exhibition, he sets the active scenes into the light: the tent of Santiago, the bar of the song Marie-Luise, which is the feeling of life with her lie and her glorious voice, Cubas.
The four musicians play Cubas Rhythmus and are both guests of the bar.
Tourism: Return to the Romans
On approximately 120 metres of length, a channel of waste from Rome is received under the Köln.
Whoever visits Köln doesn't end in the court.
At 157 metres, the two towers raise into heaven and make it to the twoth church building of Europe.
However, just a few of the churchs who have been testing the two of the Philippines know that there is also a lot to discover under the court.
Ra’s school is expert in Kölner's subject world.
The meeting point for his leaders is the Köln tourism service center directly at Dom.
"We start in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the seventy years, the town fathers wanted an auto-righteous city, and thus they stayed from the old town walls just what was not too large.
The most users of the parkhouse are therefore running to the Roman residues today and just put their car off.
But whoever looks more accurately discovers an archaeological foundation that is covered by metal grids.
Seeing are about five meters high wheels from large stones.
"The rest of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," said Schulze.
Before it returns to the daylight, the school leaves the participants on the top park level to cast another cup into a dark, 15 meters deep ship.
This is the source of the old dome, which, unfortunately, has not been kept.
Next station of access is the pretorium, and here the participants go back into the depth.
We experience the office of the only powerful man north of the Alpes, the preacher of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a cluster wants to know.
"The decline refers to "Colonia Selva Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good Germany as "City of Roman law and city of the Agrippines, based under Caiser'udius at the place of the altar for the Caisercult".
And the pretorium is the former townholder palace, the power of the Roman Empire in Rhein.
From the front space of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel, which has been obtained here at about 120 metres long.
"You can slowly get a track around the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schulze urges the guests.
A surprise still has schools.
After he got the key on the box, he leads the group to a deep 16 meters, added ship.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bad," he explains.
The Jewish congregation built her bathroom deeply in the ground to come to the basic water that was inevitable for the ritual washing.
To this day, at the bottom of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water conditions are disabled by the changed pegel of the Rhein.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the raw space for which building work should be started in cover.
But until the end is done, some years will be lost.
Almost covered: Reloading of Rocker Process
A blue attack in the rock milk is rerolled after over four years.
A process on appealing to death, an earlier body damage and business damage against two 30-year-olds has started before the Court of Justice Frankfurt (or).
It is accompanied by strict security preventions.
The complaints are increasingly increasing.
You must have been active in the rocker scene and have heard the bandidos.
The State advocate proposes them to have entered and insulted three men in a car in June 2009 with unknown complexes in Finowfurt.
All victims were severely hurt, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims must have heard for the concurrence of Hells Angels.
One must have been a high-range member of Berlin.
It seems to have been a persecution year with several cars.
According to claims, it was about revier conflicts and a power demonstration.
The two complaints were released in the beginning of 2012 in a first procedure.
One judge said that there was no evidence that men were actually shared in the bloody faults.
The teasers had masks and weren't recognised.
The Federal Court of Justice raised the judgment after the Revision of the State Agency and revoked it to the renewable negotiation of the Court of Justice.
One of the complaints is currently due to another delict in the open cycle.
In particular, it was about the restructuring of the wastes in the night of fact.
As a Witness, the expert Commissioner was then loaded.
In the center, the telephone talks were of the complaints and other persons who had listened to the police.
It is difficult that Rocker almost always keeps on a right law for them - and not expressing it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims was packed.
State lawyer Stefan Golfier from the State advocate Frankfurt (or) said on a question that since the last procedure, new tracks have occurred.
For the process there are elf further negotiations days.
The traveling company doesn't think
The night was long, the music sounds and the vote is good, but sometimes it's going home.
Only: In the books of people on the leader and backseat, the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, it may be responsible for one or other cocktail or sect!
What is closer to the next driver to get a smallness?
I say, I'm pleased to go with it when it goes to the morning at the late afternoon tomorrow tomorrow.
A few pommes, a cola, a citizen - and then nothing like home and bed!
However, on the home road, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco prisoners are observed.
Because what must a man be thrown out of the car window with regularity?!
In particular, at the weekends, paper papers are located on road changes and on parking places.
"Why?" I ask me.
Are people too doomed to take the tooths with households respectively to the next egg?
It's not just that the paper products change the landscape.
In the case of the winds have already covered instructions such as guidelines and thus exploded accidents.
About what "Worf Society" says but doesn't follow, she probably doesn't even know what this word means.
If you are on the road at night, just with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after the nights that are running: clothes, flashes and other mâss are toughing there.
There would be no more or less to do, in contrast to the street, where no one wants to travel on the rest of the other.
I see the day that the cities and the communities will be bloody - and the feast feed cats need to be demanded for their deep pounds.
Obamas Researchers in Health Policy
After a violent criticism, the President Obama made a repeatedly repeatedly repeated, clearly promised: "If you like your hospital insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received an announcement letter from their insurer, the Republicans told the President in the last days that he had disappointed the public.
Tomorrow, Obama related to his original promise.
"The major majority of citizens who have a functioning hospital insurance can keep them," he said in a talk in Boston.
As a response to the numerous media reports to the announcements, Obama requested the Americans who received such communications to review on the free market after a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive a better, more comprehensive hospital insurance for the same price or more favorable than prognosed.
"They come a better boat," he said.
The Government was as little surprising that the five Pro > of the people who have completed an insurance themselves should be considered by another tariff, since their contract does not conform to the new standards of the Abfordable Care Act.
"I want these Americans to say that you have deserved better," Zebelius said in a audience before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Abfordable Care Acts, explained that the start of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm also frustrated and wow like all others," she said.
I'm determined to win your trust back.
This exhibition of a Sebelius raised to a meeting behind her sitting adviser at the urgent consultation in the representative house was adopted after a fighting conversation with the Republican Deputy Billy Long from Missouri, which would have been committed to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of consultation, Long Sebelius repeated the question why the "Architectin" of the Abfordable Care Acts did not volunteer to a stately promoted assurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to overcome millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not occupy an attack on Syrian air weapons
An anonymous government officer who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the CNN of the Ananian newspaper that Israelian campaigns would have attacked an airport point in Syrian Latakia on a day before.
The goal was "rackets and adequate equipment" from which the Israeli government had protected that they were certain for the Libanese Hisbollah, it was called CNN.
Eagle and Libanese media and the Arab Sender Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the support point in the Latakia town was destroyed in the midweek night on Thursday, and the Israelite was responsible for it.
The israelian television channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, where russian divergences from the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rackets, which, according to the channel 2, have a width of 35 miles, and can transport spray headers up to 70 km.
Uncertainly, the Government in Jerusalem has not affected the attack officially.
However, the news agency Reʹs cites an anonymous Israeli government officer with the words that he believes that Israel has committed the attack, but be not secure.
One speaker of the Israeli Defence Minister said, "We do not comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai showed in the Daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver hisbollah the ground-luft rackets.
The Israelite Government had repeatedly warned that every effort to provide Hisbollah with chemical or other annual weapons, meaning the overrun of a "rode line" which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unexpected consciousness that the US-spionage has “too far away”
John Kerry, with an unexpected consciousness, stated an evidence of the United States' disturbing attitude in respect of their monitoring programmes, saying that the spionage was “too far away in certain cases”.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs also admitted that he was able with Barack Obama to take the responsibility for the "autopilot" when the explosive enthries of Whistleblower Edward Snowden over NSA's spionagea.
By means of the transsuaded information, the US government has been made in a diplomatic storm of destruction from its associates.
In a video connection on the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The President and I have learned without question of some of the things that have passed almost by the autopilot, simply because the ability was to do what was to the Second World War and the weak years of the Cold War and, of course, return to 11 September.”
Then, as the first high-range member of the US Government, he agreed that the US Spanish has exceeded a limit, but also stressed that no rights have been misuse.
He said, "In some cases, it has been too far."
The President is determined to make clearness, and therefore conduct a fundamental investigation so that no one needs to feel that the misuse is located here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry, however, pointed out that the NSA is a power of the good and has been saved through their monitoring operations.
He adds: "We have to do it with a new world in which people are ready to spread themselves into the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is deceived to kill people, to spread into the air and to attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it works?
We have actually prevented the murder of people because we have learned in the case of such plans.
Furthermore, US legislators will travel to Europe to spread the thoughts against the traditional spionage and convince the Europeans that it is necessary to continue to cooperate with the U.S. Anti-Terror efforts, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Thursday explained.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he has spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and was concerned about their intentions to not participate in anti-Terror organizations because of the frustration on monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the United States' national security interests that the Europeans remain on board in relation to our common efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is sitting as democracy first in the seat, and who is the president of the Senate Subcommittee for external relations and issues, in a interview in Washington.
I'm going to Europe to clarify that we need to continue to cooperate in the terrorism, unless they are concerned about the NSA programmes.
Media reports, which the NSA has received millions of phone data in Europe, have charged the relationships with some United States, although the leader of the Secret Service explained that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato-Associated and was exchanged with the United States.
Other enths quoted from Snowden's documents, whereas the NSA monitored the phone of Bundesconzler Angela Merkel and up to 34 other State headers worldwide.
The leader of the National Secret Services, James Öpper, defended the Spanish at the United States as necessary and explained that this is usually on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said, his authority prepared the trip of the Congress that was to find this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and rooms.
The names of other participants shall be published in the next days.
He said that the precise travelout will be thrown out.
Currently, Murphy pointed out that the purpose of travel is to improve the relationships, he also said that there would be some "earliest words".
He said that the governments should be honest to their population about the type of spionage programs that they used themselves for years.
"Why can we change our monitoring programmes and make the rights of the Europeans better, but they must also be with the fact that we are not the only ones to spy," thus Murphy.
Thus, for John Kerry is a traveling to the Near East and to Poland on the weekend, in order to deal with the role over the US Property, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States Monitoring Sections.

In Thailand, there is a vocation against prison penalty
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was condemned in Phuket to 15 days of prison because she had falsely claimed that a taxi-factor had been charged, has imposed against the sentence of vocation and was released on the case.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was found before by a provincie court in Phuket on 15 June for an offence to have made a falsuescage, after she had indicated the Thai police, a local taxi carrier managed them in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June, while two other men held them.
Later, however, the records of a videocamera showed that she was safe in her hotel after she had been thrown by her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket asked Bamford for two days until she was able to expose the story.
until the Court negotiated, she was careful in police office.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison penalty in a prison with low safety level at the border of Phukets, placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruby Liga, who has joined himself to the foreign ministerial in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was "extremly concerned about the goodness of his daughter and wanted her to be back in.
"We, of course, make great concerns, but we hope that she is home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has imposed against the sentence of vocation and is against a cutting of 50,000 baths on free foot.
In Australian reports, it was reading that she made a vacation at the middle of the Krabi vacation in South Thailand.
On the side of the Court, Bamford was to be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the vocation could also lead to the destruction of a penalty of up to two years in a prison for awakened.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of the traveling caffrau Michelle, would have been attempted to improve his attached tourist image, and it is therefore a free move.
