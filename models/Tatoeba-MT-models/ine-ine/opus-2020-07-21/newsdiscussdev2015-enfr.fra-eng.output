It seems to be a typical rugby club.
At an English university, maybe...
Nothing to see with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, right?
Of course not, but the premium that says that it's covering in the rugby is a big thing...
Yes, finally, the prayers of the Muslims are not interrupted and the nose of someone during the drinking games (only, except if it is part of the game), but it was actually painted in black for some deguised nights.
I never played a drink game based on the Nazi theme that he said.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus suffice.
I left a similar comment on the article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first year students was very typical.
This new information does not give doubts to me that they are going far far away than the misogynian placers and the blagues under the alcohol business that often are associated with the rugby university teams.
Incidence with Muslim Students shows that they are trying to cause the maximum.
You don't know anything in the rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your prejudices and stereotypes enter the facts?
I think the rugby LSE team is not full of older students of these schools for which the rugby of competition is a tradition.
Otherwise, older guys of the private.
Emissions of very different environments than those playing backby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So the "misogyn placers" are acceptable?
It seems to be the rugby club of my university, I never saw racist behavior, but the nearly courses through the campus, the flight, the mixture of goods and the misoghynia were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't specify it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: say that your own body itself is partly composed of this ancient water.
I'll win in serenity.
Anciently, this interestal cloud also (ouf, not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article well: a small half of the water of your past has more than 4,6 billion years...
Yes, well, we can even consider that the float of the past is in the average easily more than 2,3 billion years, which is already not so bad that it is.
A sacred foot of nose to catastrophists and rechauffists of any pool that predict the end of oceans and water resources, while this water is always existing.
An irrefutable evidence that the rebound was stopped 20 years ago (see the notable travels of Serge Ferry financed by Total and Areva).
@manon too much: In what is the evidence of the rehearing stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and ironie, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much of the problems of the biological problems.
It is not question for the “catastrophists” as you say to be concerned about the shopping of oceans but rather than the reduction of water reserves consumable by humans (You know the sweet water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then usually this is not the most threatening climate efficiency for our species, but especially the reduction of small or not renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our ways of life of more increasingly germans.
As regards the study you cite and which you make the generous effort to cite the source, you are not naturally doing the truth of the conclusion.
With regard to healthy water problems, I think the French are far away from being involved in xD Then you need to stop considering Propertyology as an unfailed dogma, the ozone box is referring to quietly (evaluation of 100% for 2050 at the current rythme).
Yes, religiously dogmatic and irrational, not thanks.
"Therefore, you must stop considering the egoology as an unfortunate dogma, the ozone's throat is referring quietly" Yes, it is not like a spontaneous movement that would not come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to speculate that climate refreshment is a need because if we educate too much CO2 our earth will react to Venus.
A bullet that by the action of the oxygen will catch the calor without free it and which in a vicious circle will accelerate the lock process in exponential way.
Did anyone see direct actions until now?
Or the latest sign indicating that 10 000 good men would come on the ground to plant trees and do what a green army should be done, what can it be well?
Probably not me!
In the small brain of Abbott, maybe sending the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're going to go back, it's sure.
When are they going to get away from this town's idiot?
The latest revelations of which planting would consume 16 % of CO2 more than any klimatic model gives the priority to replanting.
It is no logic, because CO2 is the food of plants that are the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to keep the flower in the world.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been placed.
Did you see the Green Army anywhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is increased, your argument for the food of plants is only a failure.
And before you start your glass against the Wall Dooms, the most abundant gradient is not the CO2 but the nitrogen and the pain.
The most abundant of biogenerated materials may be carbon, but it does not mean that it is the most abundant grain, so the argument of Silverhead is unfair and deserves to be ridiculated.
◆ Action is a cup, because nothing can happen again.
The LandCare budget has been severely reduced and this money is now expensed by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing money where it was the most beneficial, it is now invested there where it will receive the most publicity to make liberal return to marginal electorals.
Your contribution, however, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too many CO2 in the air, plants make less photosynthesis and contain less nutrition.
This means that animals and people must eat them in much greater quantities to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
It is evident that this member is a portfolio.
Until now, he has not presented a academic rigidity certificate that prevents it from disclosing the rules of the XVIIe.
In addition, the sanction of him and not the Tevenoud is incomprehensible for the bad of the world, even if the UN Regulation is not a tax contract.
That this lady doesn't make any matter to her honour, it appears especially as a histery.
If Mitterrand had called all those who spoke to Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminisation of the names, the "Academy" was disappointed: "Let us say Mrs. Water or Scales" (post that has never been taken by a woman).
Pure maquism!
"The political arren" ...!
The season, the back-ground of the Republic replies, the marigot of operating guulants , the table of illusions , etc ...
But the arenal assumes gladiators, people who take real risks , good grace , bad.
When the Pelocratic Umphist sits on the label and Parliamentary Regulation by entering the + elementary civility under the fake paraplue ways, the sanction applies to him "e quality" for its partial heading and its massing of the political area.
The behavior of this member is not normal or worthless of its position.
He's doing the provocation to speak about him.
Until he was now unknown, he can now be honoured to be known as any cancer of a primary class is known.
Academia to the right side and we see the lawyers are sensitive to the pocket...
The OMP should be able to solve its internal problems and stop providing couchs and scandals.
The Academy has a good deal, especially when we tell her what she doesn't say.
This member acts as a full adult crisis, which causes the provocation and whose friends are going, in delegation, to see the Principal to make the hours of collection.
and in defense, based on a text they haven't even read!
Women do not even represent 15 per cent of the signatures of this UMP court.
Mr The Court, I call to two expert witnesses that some thousands of years are separate.
That's why I love time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so clear and attractive.
The dogs, the dauphins, the otages, the horses, they do all stupid things for the simple pleasure that it provides for them.
In contrast, it would be that we would have the majority of our 80 years to work, move and make the magazines.
What strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply through two of our lives, but we are able to make the majority in the neighborhood.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that anthropomorphism is.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, the "communication" requires a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, maybe?
I think the concept of interspective communication is not compatible with your faith.
That's true.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can make the dog I'd like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game is a course, an object to go to search, etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism – even though I adhere to the idea that we are hearing many coverages about animals that are playing, while they're simply playing.
Perhaps the game is not only "usual" ( it may be, or not), it is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber considers that there is a game principle based on any reality.
"If he had learned at the oil that a woman is not an object, he might not have violated it" Perhaps the hope is...
Thanks to the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be in good health and to be able to respond to a article today when you had to drink the information without being able to respond at least 15 years ago.
In general, I am not contrary to ideas, and I would even have tend to be quite enthusiased by those who seem to look forward to the first.
But when we see what many have kept from their learning in the oil, especially among the most possible public to deliver to agressions on women, my enthusiasm does not find the latest beginning of ancrage point.
“ the most possible public to deliver to agressions on women ” It would like to learn a little more.
Or, no, it's good, we understand.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel rose, even though it doesn't necessarily match your thinking schemes.
It is true that Neilly's youth and other beautiful quarters don't hear much in class.
She prefers playing on her iphone6.
Evry's deserted youth too!
If the reactions were not reacted anymore, Twitter would not propose to follow the Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I haven't learned anything about this in the Âole and I have never violated anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Should I like my happiness?
Unless I had parents to teach some values...
Micro-society is the learning of social life.
How can we undertake the reading of life when we can't read?
And are young socialists going to schools to teach the equality of men and women?
It would be more effective than to make moralization mounts on Twitter, but it would have to get out of beautiful quarters...
Grotes this campaign.
They are nobles everywhere but to give moral lessons, it remains the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I want to see the bread in a hair.
There's a blague there on the fact of using his bread.
The article of this week isn't going to crawl there.
It's not time to make blacks around bread, man!
It's a little agitation!
You have made a double-sensitive word game with the word "naan" to make reference to a grandmother.
60 books for that?
It wouldn't even be filled with a 90-year-old retraite home.
How is it that we're paying more, less than there's in the ass?
Because the quality of experience does not necessarily measure the weight or number of calories, as well as the quality of a movie or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yeah, I agree with you.
But why should good food be used in parts that wouldn't even satisfy a moon?
It doesn't have any sense, and it is only a decisive policy to make you buy more places.
Of course, it must not be like this.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both high reasons.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini plates.
More you pay dear, more you have chances to receive a portion of child available with art in your asset.
At least they did the effort to put naps.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before you decide that London is the only place on Earth, where we can enjoy good places?
Is it the Manif for all that is only a Catholic and Musulman movement.
Yes, that's a kind of raciality of homophobs.
But that's not just this.
There are also athes and humanists who do not want modern systems of "building of children".
A child must not be raised in a bacterial level or manufactured by an apparatus.
Bathing up?
Where do you get that out?
And if you respond to any technical intervention in the "fabrication", it is necessary to claim the prohibition of the PMA for hetherosexual couples, that would be the debt of coherence.
I am also surprised that the "for all" mentioned manif has not yet this logic revendication to his attractive catalogue.
It is exactly that these are not the only cathos that demonstrate: other religions also, Jews, Muslims, protestants.
This is still useful to remember that these different churches have been opposed to all the developments of the society: in 1865 (and I meet G.
Kauffmann) An evic, Mr. Dupanloup, was violently insisting on the will of the Gvt to admit the girls to the oil in the name of "Family Defence".
We're always in the same scheme.
And, recently, the same courants have hurt the civilization and the destruction of the family when the oil has become mixed.
It is the credit that we can grant to the positions of these people.
You don't need to be catho to injure the goods of the wheat and children...
All this is in the right line of the deficiency of western civilization, more contested by others!
For me, freedom stops with the other: yes, the homosexual couples who have the right to love themselves as well as others.
But not tolerance that the child is a mobile object.
And this is also valid for the heaters in the GPA search.
I can't just love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had a better ballon control and knew to avoid fudroying hours of stupidity, he could be a more popular player.
Moreover, I am sure that any other attacker, except Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will cumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have marked if he had given more than 42 elections in national team...
I can't agree, at least not categoryally:) Because this article speaks of the purposes he marked, I will not talk about other things that he offers, especially to ManUtd (which RvP, Mata, Kagawa does not offer or bring anything), but maybe it would be another reason for which he has won was much more often chosen than Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommendation 119 This is the way to criticize Rooney at this moment, so you can forgive to do it too.
That says it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in 2011, Aōro marked 56 targets and made 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney marked 59 targets and made 32 decision-making steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
Instead, "Wazza" is a good reason to ridiculize it.
I have to ask if you really look at the foot or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve the same choices as Rooney and B) if he had so many choices.
I really don't understand from where the critics about Rooney's capacity as football.
The most difficult, it is to be regularly selected in the team of his country for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously compared to Wayne Rooney's football qualities (not even attaching) with Peter Crouch's?
Are you doing this without blaguing?
There are really people completely at the mass.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been the previous center machine for England during his career in England.
Instead, he played before returning, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch that we mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and recently Daniel Sturri.
You must have written it by blaming.
In a country where the weapons port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people have a weapon, I find it totally shizophrene and paradoxal as a way of processing.
And those in this school are not just agreed with the employment of weapons in the United States!
The use of the crayon is still self-suicide.
Stop the connery: the girl is five years old.
How many are they playing with fashioned guns at this age?
Is that actually killers in power for so much?
Although the weapons port is in the American constitution and that it is strongly affecting the culture of the country, I don't think the rich ones are sensitively different from ours.
A little good sense and reason keeped svp.
It's a disarmad procedure!
Return, you're watched!
The information about this different fact is insufficient to evaluate whether this little girl really has, or does not have any premises to go of morbid.
Can we go from the principle that a series of killers can't have a strange behavior at the age of 5 years?
If people need a psy follower, it's more mabouls of this school than the Âs!
Let parents take their boy from there: she's in danger!
Completely agreed.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely sick.
Your response is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state of the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These blue coasts that men bring nothing of a undertaker!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson take at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar was carrying a long bottle in the cow and Sir Richard Branson was carrying a round cow.
I can't comment because I've never seen this, but everything seems so hurtful and without.
I don't have the impression that he wanted to say.
Contra, maybe?
But how depressing it looks!
You've forwarded me.
I would have thought that a mature knowledge of the AIDS would be an hot for business.
I'm asking what Mr. Bjayou does these days.
Perhaps when saying "ostraciser", he would mean "external".
It would be logical.
No, I thought that was what he could have said, but ostraciser doesn't always have sense.
In the worst, if all candidates were like Carmen Miranda and Sugar had a grid costume, it could be advanced that their intention was to ostraciser.
But here, no.
It seems to have been corrected – strange. Perhaps the whole phrase has been invented!
It's not funny.
Who knows what he could say well?
Probably nothing, but someone would absolutely quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well "ostraciser", which would not absolutely say anything.
The rate of shoaming in the United States has still been decreased, about 6%.
Never seen since 2001.
The prices of the extent are decreased in all States.
The American economy, with Obama, continues to strengthen.
Who's saying better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "soutenable"?
To live there at this time, I will say that the United States are quickly approaching the explosion as the inequality becomes foolish.
The political system is literally enriched by the financing of electoral campaigns.
Racial pressures, police violence, mass incarceration have an increase that we do not imagine in Europe but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
How long?
This is the main question.
A few days ago, the financial environments said that France was lost.
Now, it's the American who's at the end of his roll.
Happy, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Return one of these articles that simply forget the essential.
The level of consumption of the US economy is no longer supportable...
Boards and billet tables wouldn't know for a long time to give the change...
On the basis of the elimination of earthly resources and growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And probably the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "trick" or rather marble.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Does the Labour finally understand that its cynic and decisive policy to import compliant voters from the foreigner make him lose more support with him?
I don't imagine.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance to any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continued with Russia.
Laboratory honest performance, Ed Milliband is in the mouse, it plays 617 votes.
What about 11% for the Labor – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less in the fact that the massive immigration policy of the Government of Blair was designed “to breathe the right nose in the diversity”
The Labour delivers the partial election, the Tories lost the partial selection in safe seat against ukip = Crisis Labour Have you spoken about your fight against reality with a therapy?
I think that it's the same Multiculturalism that brings this return of manivel, the pendule has expanded very far since the end of the war, and I think he's now going to share in the other sense.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapy?
Lol - Safe Seat of the Labor, a 617 vote difference.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, everyone who's not in the deni knows it.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for the Labor, it's a victory at Pyrrhus.
Find the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentally against the word "defect", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a victory, but she's mad.
The Labour had to win at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them getting the majority?
Personally, I have little importance to win in 2015 until the Lib Dems are not here.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, right?
Yes, I know Canada, Greenland and the north of Russia are hard.
In contrast, do I ask if the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered too?
In general, it is to be seen the most “patchful ” earth than we imagine.
Is that right?
Some little perplexity.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us about a "soundly simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that puts on the earth's crown, the pressure on the hair is relaxed, which would give (a) a shot to the production of magma (b) by facilitating its access to the surface??
In any case, the "foot-cook" or the facilitation of access to the surface will be located ( more or less).
Difficulty to distinguish the cause of the effect and inverse on climate destruction, I am able to focus on its effects on our environment, which is already very complex.
Very friendly, patriced, does this vulcanism not affect our environment?
Does it not have any effect on our climate, future or past?
Isn't Prudence to go back?
When complexity is not able to solve by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yes, but also, when he's night, we see less well.
Hello, the end of the last iceary period was also accompanied by a stronger sismical activity, in particular in the “active” mountain chain where on the very English continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordialement CB
It is ignored too often that the earthly crown floats on the magma and that the only pass of the moon makes it up or down from about 30 to 60 cm, differently, after its transition to zenith, as it does for the ocean waters.
What makes the glamour of the tectonical plates, as well as the masters, is more or less easily by this movement boss, as much as the pool calotts are allocated by the source of ice, which thus causes a change in the equator equator equivalents, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am interested in this "human", saying the Supreme of the Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, ridiculated by his stupid action on the environment that created it and whom he so separated that became harmful, and himself and this environment.
And all of this to remain the superior commander of this nature that exceeds it in the organization of its own victoria, by an invention that consists of finding all the means possible to dominate his neighbor, one another, who is deceived of the ability, the money.
The earthquake is not on the magma, but on the earthquake, which is constituted of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at it.
Arrogant and arrogant.
This reminds me Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next party.
Belle history Wild1
Instead, it reminds me of a totally generous series of 2002 named Ape-man.
One of the best documentary series I've never seen.
Excellently, almost nobody remembers this now.
Damage that you never have passed outside the first impression.
Your loss...
“ The geʹs, our remote preachers ” You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thanks Brian
I am almost sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been performed several times, they are still going to Ethiopia (obviously)
Oh, there I don't support this guy, Brian 'air miles' Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to claim to make a bike eyes before a brain in a bocal.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you, committed to look at Coxy.
Maybe there is a group of support for you, it says.
I agree, everything is present in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet a marxist bottle?
In fact, this is the individualistic identity that has been predicted today.
She therefore needs to be himself, so it does not agree.
Certainly, but Desartes also takes place at the event of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this progress.
But at that time, these are just the premises that appear, today the individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're well in the "mass" individualism!
Without doing an unexpected horizon, there is no parent with the Cartesian approach to examine what we receive to believe, what we believe ourselves.
More than rebellion, the doubt is fecond.
Making Fo ́ault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and revoke it.
His work on psychiatries has produced a contra - reform!
With the problem at the level of its paranoid nominal, he blocked all progress and any reflection on the reality of foolishness.
And brought the most reduced and reactionary vision that supports: behaviorism.
Left has absolutely reason for this and being anti-conformist, it is to fight this disappearance.
We're reproaching in Marcel Gauchet to be a defensor of the order.
Great idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, ask one...
Blacks and beaches, to others.
Beeps and robots, they understand the most followed of those who see riddles in their mirror.
Thanks in any case to his responsible polymetics for sending under the fires of the present Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and so pedagogically lighting.
David Cameron supports the growth of the inheritance tax level
How many other budgetary costs will be necessary to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave's robot will make a good increase in its net value once he's not going to be powerful.
Business Councils, allocations, consultations costs, a series of best-sellers written by a negree on the "serious policy" – it will be worth 100 £ once the weapons are left.
Of course, he doesn't want tax on heritage.
Isn't that the same lie as the last choice?
And the richest are those who are very sure paying less tax on heritage through super-paid accounts and tax evacuation programmes.
This has all the signs of an empire in decline where heritage kills innovation.
It'll be 100 pounds when he'll pass the weapons on the left.
Anything.
He's probably promised to decrease the level of 1 million £, which is well about what you say it's worth.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the level of 650 000 for the couples?
Did you also think Brown thought only to his own inheritants, or are you only a free brain tribalist?
We didn't choose it last time, we had a coalition at the place.
You could not allow you to accuse him to lie only if we had actually chosen it to the power.
Like the rest of us, Dave will not die "normally".
The climate change and fluctuation will end it, he and the others of his end.
His “richness ” will be as unusual as the one of the others and will not save him nor his children.
Incapable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where the government debt has exceeded 1.000 000 000 000 £.
We all have to be imposed to pay the essential services and refund the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I don't say that the discipline diplomatic is inutile, of course, I just say that it is insufficient to acquire certain natural "sufficients".
Unreasonal declaration for the math Professor she was!
Like...
Better recruiting and better training teachers this is a quality approach.
However, the French political class does not know any other approach than quantitative.
There are two possible answers, the first would be to choose teachers according to their ability to translate knowledge => reform recruitment methods.
By +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
She doesn't understand them, she doesn't know how to act or react to work well => It's reduced to establish a defiance relationship that causes everyone to suffer in pure loss => I'd need 1 training for skills to teach.
A medium that learns, sure.
But the pedagogy is first one art, a natural provision and a vocation before being a technology.
Working on and with human beings is not to manufacture car pieces.
The pedagogy doesn't equate even when we're mathematical!
"Education Sciences" can't acquire a few natural abilities.
What is now missing, right now, is a real call at the bcp of those who take the profession
If the gifts exist, pedagogy (I prefer the discipline) allows those who are less likely not to be wronged.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the →s of which 1/3 tells us: it's nothing I already know what I think.
A Slate article describes the chaotic situation of this return.
Let's look at the old normal schools of Institutors.
She ended at 3 hours the morning from this week, but she started at midnight.
If it seems that it is appropriate for his time employment.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't fit to me!
It's been years ago that its emission starts at midnight.
We have this thing called Iplayer and that allows us to listen to emissions at the request when we want it!
The Internet is incredible, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum 4 MB download speed, I can't really listen to radio emissions.
I have an usb type adapter at my SKY box and is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV has seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I missed in the hours, I had to hear Richard Lester about 3 hours.
Although it's men on the radio day 2, they could at least put a woman in his antenna hour when one of men is in vacation or sick, it would at least please people.
They should start by getting away from Jeremy Vine.
Its emission is of anything sensitive in debate, and it would be better on a chain like the LBC.
The lack of DJ women today, where no of the regular animators, of Chris Evans the morning at Simon May's emission at night on the back of the job, is not a woman
It's five emissions.
So what (of these five) is the most possible to be.
Shennan knows it very well, but he doesn't say anything - for the instant.
Steve Wright is the semi-deduction of this time.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to offices as a real journalist, but the dinner keeps all the glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I think he's quiet, waiting for the current team to get married or turn away.
I was born in Switzerland in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal that these people vote in the United Nations.
Since 40 years, we have the same two parties that change to power and make the keys of the country to the other in less good state than they have taken it.
The campaigns are very poor, rather poor than the isolation.
We need to make miles to find a movie, a bar, a gymnase, a theater.
But as they don't burn a car, they don't aggress, they don't deal with, they don't interest the political men...
But don't talk about a department where you don't have v.
Yes ,Doclocal , they are under men , sociology is good to pick on them.
They also have the rate of absenteism and a very high alcoholism...
The FN promotes the hum's beast, the inculture and the ignorance so much that it still has a huge potential growth, it really needs them to be bad so that they don't have done better...
Today, the UN is especially promoting misfortune, fear of daily, the one of the other and the feeling that there is no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What pityable humanitarian.

"forgotten" in fact, there are less than resource =>base funds.
Here's the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just "meet and mix", women must be integrated in the development process.
I would like to say that in many developing countries, existing standards are submitted, such as keeping children and socio-reproductive roles.
This allows women to recognize that women can work in the economic area and that is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double flood, that is, we will expect them to go to work while they continue to fill their socio-producer role.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
Economy and benefits do not have sex's roles.
The money is talking, and if a sex is not at the height, the next!
The benefits are lost of your life.
What are you doing, what is the benefit and what you have to offer?
The benefits are lost from heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, businesses would listen.
Employment friends will never use women of age 20 to 45.
Well, my sister.
It is very difficult that no one speaks of unbalanced social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unrecompensed social work (which is the majority of women) must be equivalent to more than 50% of the BDP.
The unbalanced social work does not receive enough support and is under-valuable (without speaking of the fact that men do not do it enough), but it allows our companies to work and keep our work.
Unbalanced social work is also an important reason for which many women are unable to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the house...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the responsibility taken in a manner disproportionated by women when we conduct sex integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he will help many people who have to "cook a house".
The tigre is not Russian, it's only the West propaganda.
The Chinese are only responsible for the current situation and would better sit at the negotiations table.
The tiger right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are just in exercise near the border, long-term exercises before the present situation.
Furthermore, the tigre has no anti-air missile in its possession.
Free Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He just came to me the same kind of idea.
Here's a pretext all found to arm some separates to join China.
If the Tiger of Siberia is in China, it is that China is in Siberia.
It's only time to repair this error.
Why is an article on a wonderful tigre and a real risk of extinction, finally transforming it into an article of beating guides against Poutine?
What's he doing inside?
This is therefore not a faith in the Tigre of Siberia, but a faith in the follow-ups of Poutine's com's operation.
When we are exposed to the media, we are also exposed to ironie or even critical.
Perpetual victimization reverse of sympathisants of its potential.
Holland had also taken full of the powder with his camel without crying to the French anti-France complex.
Our learning Alain Bougrain-Dubourg holy protector of the Great Russia was personally involved in the re-introduction of this tiger.
Anyway, the tigre he's all understanding, he's bar...
That Holland's going to be low, it's something.
Firstly, it seemed to be a terrifying idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems to be a response to a real problem - the dental subventions of emergency - and effective.
So it is difficult to find something to go back.
And if only 53% of this sample were broke the teeth before, and →% after, it is a little blank sense of painting the patriarch.
In all, there's no inconvenient to break the teeth!
In fact, the complaints are related to the fact that they are targeted to unemployment and that it confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that is exactly, then it's not a justified critic.
Belindateraith, of the Regional Health Committee of Canterbury, said that the Ministry was concerned about the number of emergency dental subventions offered by the Department Working and Income of the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
At a median level, there would be better adjusted means to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonable.
There is an inconvenient thing to breathe the teeth.
If you broke them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamelake.
If your teeth breast is old and strong, it can pick the gentile and cause inflammation.
And I remember an emission on the book Guiness of records where someone had tried to broke the teeth as long as the judges of Guiness at the time had been strongly disappointed to do it because of the harmful effects of a frequency and prolonged brossing of teeth.
'for the first view' is very funny.
It seems to be a potential experimental design.
The simple factor of being voluntary for this study will have changed the habits of participants who know that the brossing of teeth would be studied.
That is why most of the behavior studies include things such as double age, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
Supposing that these texts are sent to each young who understands social benefits, there are two things that distinguish this from the test: 1) These are not volunteers, and 2) they do not give information back on the time they broke or not broke their teeth (easy outcomes in the air by people who give their results according to the expectations).
Does the epigenetic consequences have?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including the uterus) will have effect on genetic heritage, not in the geneome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited trades will be transferred to the following generation.
Does the grip of the uterus affect this phenomena?
The nidation is itself to a kind of grip.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we don't want to be born of a perfect clone of ourselves, is it a problem first?
I think it's going beyond the limit of the reasonable.
The desire of maternity and parentality should not move to go still far away, without putting the question of ethical, risk, mother and child.
Not the doctor is not all powerful, it is not without limit, and it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they want.
This has nothing, absolutely nothing to see with the tran

Now as a man, I wouldn't allow to judge in a sense or another or to participate in this gift, but I'll listen to women to it.
@Margane: actually, it has nothing of ananodin, and it strengthens the love act that it involves.
Giving a rein to a member of his family who needs it has nothing to do, and it is!
Please, don't make any Messi v Ronaldo combinations.

They're too good for the Second, but they don't have the Liga standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winner team of the title.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the sports before he went to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to make all the records of the Real Madrid purpose this season to be able to return to Old Trafford this summer with quiet consciousness...
I'm worried to believe it.
I think Ronaldo will finish his career at Santiago Bernebeu.

It seemed to me read a few times ago that a black child mom had been discovered in the current Libya and that this covered had opened new horizons, including geographical and timely (I think I remember that the mother was 1000 years ago to the first known African moms).
Do you have information about this?
Thank you for progress.

We knew the song.
And there is enough that a scientist European states that, even without any evidence, it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and so the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything with them.
But the song doesn't tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it is not and always "from his foreheads badly."
You should read the article.
This is an article published by neo-liberal checks of the free market, which preaches against the mobility of persons and the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people reached from Ebola and about whom the Spanish Government lies to us, not to give a bad image and to protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but the right governments, in particular (c.e. those of Spain and the United Kingdom), have tendence to protect business interests instead of those of people.
Stop, don't stop calling your local MP and blame your lack of transparency.
Even if I think that the government here is only a band of connards, good to nothing and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt that it is their biggest concern.
What are you doing?
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the infinite and its) because tourism is one of the only things that allow millions of people in this country to keep the head out of water, I would say that it is important.
If they are absolutely disappointed by the missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't send them to a air military basis and protect them there in a country hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had the mission to dismantle the Spanish Health Service, privatizing the nationalized hospitals, especially in Madrid, which is its power base until the courts entered into.
It's nothing but a right enjoyer for relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's missing the next elections.
To be right toward Cameron (I know that it is not easy here) socially he is far away from his right right and would find his place to the right religious fools in America.
Now he must sing the praise of the hospitals he had already descended to try to achieve his goal that is to protect the Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European part of right to the Spanish right.
It's cases other than me.
The Spanish Government lies about almost all that is related to it.
It's not like someone could accuse you to spread infunded sounds.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of Guardian is called The comments are free.

Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum .

It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villermé found the work of the children of 8 a.m. 10 a.m., when the Canuts were taking place because of a signed collective convention.
Oh, good old time...
Your reaction is so fascinating by your ignorance of TPE patrons!

Four manuscripts recorded on my salary bulletin of my youth, more than 100 information today!
This is an example, we could cite much more, which illustrates the continuous flow of restrictions, imposed without measure of consequences, and that enhance the small company.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as a expert and not as a surbon client.
In order to break the cow to the argument repeated by the French Working Code in comparison with the heavy, a serious university would be stuck in the Swiss texts and would have compared the number of of official texts and then the comments (without the latest of these can mean that Swedish laws are more comprehensible than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether or not, the jurisprudence is designed in particular...
And yeah, in France, there is another judge who is charged to apply the laws when a salary is licensed, for example....

Go ahead, the choice doesn't miss in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists that are not passwords of the party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a Chinese government troll.
I think China has produced many good modern artists.
Those who are portfolio of the Government are not appreciated in O日, and those who are not passwords are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, this is what you're doing.
Thank you for this, you just destroyed my little dinner.
I'm sorry, but I needed any price to expose it (without doing a bad word game).

KARSENTY DEMISSION This Lord is indispensable to carry out a electoral mandate of all boards (including sionists) must be put to the art.
Philippe Karsenty and his ridicules theories of the complot, which have valued several Judicial convictions, make Israel and Neilly's mairi.
He doesn't represent one or another.
Philippe Karsenty leads his fight against the truth alone, in marginal.
WHAT IS RECESSED TO ASSEMBLE
What does the Neilly Marie against Philipe Karsenty, who aggresses a journalist and his family, and calls to attack this urbanist?
Crime apology?
I don't find Neuilly on my map?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges?
This type needs care, as well as Ulcan Che日, they both do in the theory of the antijuif/anti-Israel complex and whose residences are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
In the same term as many people believe in any political decision, the hands of the "sionists" (the term that the sense has tend to disappear, because of its abuse), these two there, in the same title as the →J or even the CRIF, believe in any critical, even banal, an object antisemitism "which is not without reminding the shadowst hours of our story because it is still fecond the beast of my good lady we would have believed in Russia of the 19th century!"
Note that the incroy’s stupid Karsenty's theories on Charles Enderlin's reporting are still stupider than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the complex on September 11 are of a very crazy beast.
And this type has political responsibilities, it is extremely concerned.
In order to clarify my analogue with the theory of the complex of 11 September, cognitive dissonsion is discussed about how to address the subject.
Totally increased by a totally colorful truth, spent too much time, expendited too much money to get this, it is unsupportable to the adoption of this theory to distract it (as in the case of extreme religious).
Therefore, a logic and unpleasant fleeing forward, the end justifies all means, even lies, which is a complication, but it does not seem to disturb the mission of the concerned.
You advise to take care of and not put everybody in the same bag, but that's what you're doing for September 11.
There are still questions without answers for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudians/consorts are not pressed to answer it.
There are actually very colorful theories, but the official theory is, at least on some points.
Oh, nothing else is funny now...
Health NGOs and health portfolios find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their efforts to employment.
And, of course, they will need more subventions to follow!
As the fact of smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized that what it is actually, the alcohol will also know his time of judgment where the real damage caused in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it is easy to please say things like "alcool consumption is increasing," but what requires (small) more effort is to give real facts.
Sorry if you view this as an attack - you're going to drink a drink and deceive?
It is better to risk this rather than to put my mental health in danger by abstaining me.
The Government ends the pleasures when it costs him money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on unbelievable statistics.
Two average glasses per day are at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quotation → indicates that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second involves that it is a amount more or less without danger.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should agree (apart from one or two glass, but especially not three) and give us a number that they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now, we're gonna take them back, like smokers!
They're already doing it - soon it'll be grass!
My father didn't drink and didn't smoke, and the cancer brought him 64 years old.
So I'm going to keep drinking my two red bottles on Friday and Saturday night (and the other night when my wife is not there).
Why cancer Council encourages children to go to the sites where alcohol is used This is an old presentation that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not linked to a risk of cancer today?
Requins don't get cancer - they eat anything but they're not a good company.
Recorns can take the cancer - the skin cancer.

Exactly, +1
I just want a quick and quick repair to Jules Bianchi!
Brussels 2003, Europe 2007, the accidents that failed to occur between deployment and f1 were warnings without cost.
We knew that one day this would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, said it for years.
How the course organization and the FIA could have allowed these handworks without outside the car?
I can't accept that the risks of the chair or the fault are invoked when we haven't prevented the pre-prevention.
And that accident was it.
Even so, it must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which does not only mean "prohibition to overcome in the area" but is for the first purpose of signaling a danger.
It's not damn, it's happy for the family to be before the television.
Even under yellow flags, pilots will just rise up.

But well, we're caused in the empty there, until we've seen the images, we're not able to make a view.

Is there any wounds?
According to the CBC, no hurt has been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before this happens, which causes me to ask me what caused depression.
It is difficult to believe that there are still jobs where we must keep 24 hours on 24 hours.
I don't think there are hurt people because Canada is almost empty.
Perhaps there are hurt animals like wears, lave ratons, etc.
I hope it's an ironic.
Some of Vancouver parties have the strongest population density in North America and the Toronto agglomeration accounts for at least six million residents.
In Saskatchewan's campaign, trains do not work as increasingly, and these types of trains often cross the town areas.
Almost every Canadian city is passed through a railway line, and trains are very, very often in one day.
Moreover, as the roads often follow the water courses in the regions where there are lakes, oceans or oceans, they also pass into deeply small places, because people always want to live near the water.
Thus, all railway traffic is through the center of a city because there was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a great potential for railway disasters in Canada.
Mansbri's made a report on this last night, really shocking.
Did you, obviously, not read the article on the railway and explosion of a train in a city of Quebec who made 47 dead?
In fact, you're in part right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city well before the iron road.
This means, when the railways were built, they passed through the center of the communities established because it was the most direct and central road.

But our oligarchie also has its worships: the strong euro ( instead of the current ) or the free market (being supported by the State when it is necessary ) , etc .
Great ideas of religious surgery.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational seems, the religious is at the remorque and expresses it in the schism.
The religion has been born as a ideological support of the State, and the gods who served ambitions even if it has also brought the forms of contestation.
The theology declined between faithfulness in the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of the time was not aware.
Fanatism is often described as a bad interpretation of "health texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts that are used by exposed appesl to the hatred of the unbeliever.
Instead, they are the moderate religious (and happily they are most) who "lead bad" the texts and keep them only from humanism and common values to mankind, atheists and believers.
For me, fanatism is the use of the beast and evil passages of the holy texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Coran calling to kill "unbelievers", "infidels", "hypocrites", "juifs" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and, therefore, inacceptable if there are no verses higher or lower indicating that these executions are justified only in cases where the Muslims are attacked, killed and in the situation of defense.

The Australian film produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
It includes Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.

And I say that as a Roman citizen.
From Transylvania, with a Hungarian origin woman, in contrast.
I can't support Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the local powers that has not stopped denegating the Roman football to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperative" which decided before the start of the season what team would bring the championnat, which teams would go in Europe, which would be relevanced and which was white-core money, mainly selling players who were well-estimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelone, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (approximately a million euros), then paid them, but, apparently, he was badly advised by his lawyers, he accepted his errors to the court (which would have been worthy of a purified conviction) and thus took 3 years and half of prison.
The proceedings also valued the prison to the brothers Becali, four owners of clubs, the Steaua Mihai Stoica, and Popescu for crimes related to the football.
George Becali also purchases a penalty for trying to subdue (and then dissimulated the facts) a team to make us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the championnat, to get the title and get the jackpot of the champions Ligue.
The team he tried to sudoyer was our neighbors of Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first campions of Cluj while they were relevanced.
I'm always doing so much at this time.
In the dissimulation of this tentative of corruption, Piturca, which signed as a witness as a false document that indicated that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a land sale.
So this poor guy's not educated, idiot, trigger, and liar doesn't represent me, and he's never gonna do it.

I will conclude that the "socialist" pattern of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read a article of the canard?
A labourman can remain several months without news of his agency, but he must continue to search for jobs by its own means.
The controls have been allowed to radiate people who have no longer affected unemployment.
So we ask ourselves how to control people that we never see.
You are wondering what sanction is a radiation for someone who does not have access to the postal services or unemployment allocations.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow more radiation, we ask ourselves how it will help recruitment.
“The unemployed one can stay several months without news of his agency, but he must continue to search for jobs by his own means” Effectively, it is honest.
Why are these countries in the EU, while authorities are unable to defend European equality ideals?
Isn't it as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had made a major choice about racism in the foot?
Should we get them out of the EU?
The EU was only economically originated and should remain.
The goal is not to be a "People of thoughts".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It doesn't have any sense on a economic plan.
This is probably the reason why Great Britain will soon leave the EU: this is the most inequality society in Europe.
What equality?
Eastern Europe's teams continue to have the EUFA's corrupt mafia arbitrs.
The best solution would be that all East leaves this possible lucrative organization and creates its own.
At least we'll finally look at football.
This antiracism cross is only a `ran to cover injustice and corruption!
No, it's not true.
The currency and trade, rather.
European equality ideals?
So what is the matter with Europe to let the United Kingdom enter?
Uefa should appreciate them for delighting the Blatter's and his men's committee.
That's happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not surprising.
Got from Gardian two or three days ago:
Would he hope to see a little symmetrical phrase, just a story to get polymetic?
Anyway, it is a fact that at every small event to peace there is, there is, and there will be people who work to cast oil on fire.
The decade would be to say that the OA States are against a "Palistinian State" that they are pro-Israelian and that it only explains that these States have never done anything against Israeli State.
The deduction would be to say that to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, it should act against the overarmed Israeli identity state occupied by a colonizing oppressor destruction
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestinian in the detriment of an Arabian population who was not for anything in Shoah, it was more reasonable to clean the Bavier of its German people (which were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them by the Jews on Property.
It would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to claim, and Europe would have held millions of educated, entrepreneurs and dynamic residents.
Mr., let's take the example of Sahara O日al colonization...
Let the Marokko be the colonialist, it's evidence!
But as for Israel, we also need to ask the story, his covenants and support for the truth.
The colonialism, whether or not, has never been altruist, we agree.
Then stop your piroutes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule was colonized by the Romans, but now there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulois or others.
In Palestini, there is a discrimination based on origins.
Moreover, the Israeli state is defined as the one of a "Jewish people" whose non-Jewish people will not be able to be part.
The Israeli state says the non-Jewish, from which it is satisfied.
Conclusion: In order to resolve the conflict, sionism must be broken against Jewish and non-Jewish.
In Maghreb, some people have even been baptized by the name of their first status by this salvation civilization!
Two realities we need to stop ignoring.
Primo, the European sionist project (colonising appeal to the Palestinian) involved the deposit of the Palestinians, therefore it was an intrinsic antipalestinian project, therefore the solution needed to break with sionism.
Second, sionism is a political ideaology.
Uruguay has missed death since the department.
They're gonna give them what their fingers can smile.
He should start his rehabilitation by a small mouse.
I hope he didn't lose the appetite of the game.
So many suctises are tolerated, including racial hurts and hard tacs in the football, but Suarez has been sanctified too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to the earth, no matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molars.
Football is a contact sport where the tacks exist, and therefore, the players will hurt.
The fact of returning his teeth into the body of an opposite to have the benefit has no place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for making a similar gesture.
Now it's the third time Suarez's doing this.
If you're doing somebody at work.
What would be the consequences of you?
I knew somebody was going to shoot.
If you're dyslexic, I'll forgive you.
I'm actually dyslexical.
I'm forgiving this sarcasm with two balls.
I guess he was quick to go back to play full teeth.
All these words games on Suarez are losing their death.
I didn't hurt the hazard.
An essential condition for a good school park is respect for their teachers and school institutions.
This works if parents involve this respect for their children.
Parents make this easier if they also feel respected by their children's professors and children.
In good institutions, those who make their students progress, parents are considered partners, not emms.
Who can believe that it is the Professor who should do all the work (to teach, to educate, to respect, to live shortly) It is for parents to make at least 50% of the tax.
But it is certainly more simple to take it into the oil.
It is not operational to put on parents.
No one really took them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
In contrast, school institution could have many things.
Operational solutions and residents.
Should actors (professors, hierarchies and ministers) play their role there and do not continue to be touched.
We can solve a troop that turns away to restore it, not the family.
How not talking about education.
It is true that communication courses allow changes.
It seems to form teachers, but we forget the first role of the oil.
Transfer knowledge.
And if there is a need for parents, it is that the oil will ensure their children's education.
What is the Minister who will be able to repeat what the Public Instruction was called.
Article decisive: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Are you really waiting for a smart comment on this beef of the East borders?
It's a beep, it's, but I think he's not Willoughby, and so from North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He accepts the facts.
It's not surprising that we have a budgetary emergency.
Let him fall, and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
squarely true
That's it.
A little of Aloysius.
His electorate is Sydney North Side.
In fact, a drinker from the north coast!!!!
Well, if British BBC televisors want to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would clearly conclude that both are held by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It's going to be a brilliant today. :(
Yes, but his good leader lets him regularly on his famine.
Instead, you would be awesome also if you wake up a morning and realize that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these licit and illegal benefits will remain forever out of your port.
Pope Joe.
Very pathetic.
He tried to present a budget and then left.
At least he doesn't threaten to persecute someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be commanded, without gas turbines - in a remote country and call for aid in the State.
And as she knows to do lobbying, no fear of the result.
And so much for the employment in France, which doesn't have anything to do, she is still ready to lose when their corporation has losses on the markets, especially foreign...
It is just because their lobbying has not worked only the command has been cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time or adjustment for marpol, no doubt the project would have expired.
Now, to know if it's good or not and how BF will conform to the law despite all, it would be fair that "the world" is over!
The Brittany Ferries company is arrested by Brittany Ferries.
Those who burn the tax and sugar centres.
They want the State's help.
That they didn't have it to me for at least normal.
And so as a ship under the French metropolitan pavilion is 30% more dear than any other civilized pavilion, it is normal to wait for a powder of the State.
Or then we are condemned to tolerate that British people monopolize the market.
It's at the choice.
Eternal French problem that considers its maritime factors as tourist destinations, not as activities areas, where sometimes people live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, missing investment, from all short-time.
One of the reasons for which Bretagne must find its sovereignty.
It is this and then they will create the British pavillon with teams composed of pure brethren.
As soon as it is sure they're gonna make the costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, this is what we are doing from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything that was related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they have chosen to pass outside Hackett's solar career, which has always been closer to the spirit of Genesis of the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for Property/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you really don't understand their music.
To say the truth, they are almost not mentioning Gabriel's only work.
I don't think that the BBC can be accused of "deteating everything that is related to the prog" because they are going to distribute a documentary of one hour and a half on one of the largest groups of progs who have never existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a movie about the Group of Genesis, not on projects only of its members.
As regards Hackett's solar career that would be "nearer than the spirit of Genesis of the 70s", I am not agreed.
Hackett has no longer the right to take the road, play a number of songs of Genesis on which he had different degrees of participation and claim to have a niceness with Genesis that David Gilmore has the right to raise a half-finished demo rate and call this a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett doesn't ask anything more than a just representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, the first solo album of Bank, is absolutely generous, and actually in the spirit of Genesis of the 70s.
They passed outside Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been performed if they didn't have their commercial pop success in the 1980s?
I have not always seen the BBC spread a long documentary on groups such as King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a very interesting story but missing the popular attitude as Genesis has.
Good notes.
I would like to say that the BBC has always hated the fact that it ADRAIT the progressive music at the time.
A person with personal interest cries “prejudiced”: of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If death penalty is a temptation to double a terrible act by another terrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is an exciting success.
There will always be a difference of size between a deadly condemned oval and those who kill him.
He has done his act since his fake understanding of the society and its rules.
Those who kill him do it from the most righteous and wise view of a society.
That means they have no excuse.
They're undefendable.
Yes, we had understanded your point of view, the first time.
That is exactly the difference, Mr LeClos.
We need to have the well-like mind of the mortal community to enjoy violence.
That's what the igeel has done since his fake hearing of things.
But this is also what causes pain, hatred, victimity at the neighbors of the innocent victim: a false understanding which will never be able to prevalence those who are wisely determining the death of others from the healthy and just reasoning of their pedestal.
But to try to equilibrate the analysis, we could do the same valuation that the condemned to death often has exercised a salvational violence, which he could play, against extremely loving people, who made freely the costs.
The neighbors of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain affected by the disappearance of the one who was the bourreal, sometimes the tortionary, of being loved and healing their nights.
Don't worry about them.
Thanks for this thinking I find very just.
A strong and emotional article.
As regards Marc Asnin, he shows greatness.
The heart cell.
It's certainly what I've been reading for a long time.
However, we would believe reading stories of another time, ancient things, which the barbary of the past would excuse, and then there are the dates that claim, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is so genius.
Similarly, for the other two "Excellents Romanciers Americans" cited here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all surfaced.
I thought you stopped the white, man.
What's going on?
Roth is great, better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is uncomfortable, better than this penitent Bellow, who received his price.
Perhaps the judges of Nobel this year decided that if we have to have a American laurate, we could have a [read] racist.
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "geny romans" as if it was a literary type.
His homonym Joseph against...
What are you reading?
How many books of DeLillo the anti-DeLillo read?
I never ended underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Did you read The Body Artist?
The news as "Home Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first Romans, more foolish, smaller, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'm gonna end a day underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who prefers to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his talent of →an, I can only fear that his preferred romance is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict?
It's a simple interest.
It was a humanitarian treaty, "law", not a definition request.
Among the text and the mind, there is so much EVIDENT that the lady acted in SON only interest, and absolutely not in the institution that it represented, that we ask ourselves what the term "conflict" is going to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take very dear.
Yes, the state's services are very practical: whether they prevent a dynamic undertaking to create a value, or they have not prevented it from danger.
After we hear that the French salaries are not dynamic and are only seeking tranquillity.
The inflammable areas that become constructable from day to day on the next day when a large building program will be launched there is classic, not only on a low coast.
Look at the holiday plains near the areas.
We were told that “in our day there are no more intentions through the regulatory bargage”.
Now, we need to increase the retention lakes up and cross the fingers.
But it will be because of the state's services, of course...
The benefit on the ground, the promotion enemy?
By the ground.
So 6 million euros.
He's more interested there?
Get out the calculator and you'll dream to the life you could have in place of Mrs. Babin, the first UMP adjoint of La Faute on Sea and the former president of the Urbanism Commission, which grants the permissions to build!
The two mothers of the Sarkozysme triomphant are old and immobiliar.
I'm on the left and not all sympathising with Sarko, but svp, not political low or low-political goats, we're not there in a battle of potential bottles.
I wonder if the flics involved in these recent fusils were also involved in these incidents.
The United States Flicks are endured.
U.S. is a fucking shit.
So what the hell are you living, you?
The United States isn't a fucking crap.
Yes, the American flics are endured because of the raâls to which they have been working daily.
Of course, no one of them doesn't do anything but the flicks “come to emmert them because they are racished. ”
Here's a good excuse.
racism is endemic in the United States, unfortunately it fails an accident like that to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization shows a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
Good flicks must denote corrupt racist flics.
Venice them!
Make the calculation.
This type of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you participate in a conversation?
This is not a conversation, you accuse someone to be ignorant while you are actually not picking anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem that is the racism in the United States (not the ocean speculation).
It is strong that you appreciate the extension of the problem and do not appreciate how pressure is on this point.
Therefore, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which have never been very strong, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in various ways, from which the treatment from Occupy there.
What amazing me is the naivity of some, and it shooks me the fake naivity of VA and others.
And where do you think the research journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They will ask the responsibles, make them speak, survive confidence.
That Lhomme goes to Elisea doesn't really have anything to surprise.
Then, it is collection, verification, analysis.
And there we realize that the sarcolades have anxiety to do.
@Munstead, our current president was elected on an antisarkozysme vague based on any part of the business (a non-local and no conviction) which had been recognised by judges(2 returns in correction), two friends of Holland.
If this rebellion is reflected between justice, political, exemptive and the press that is not supposed to be a body of power, it is that your partisan mind is awesome to you!
RV with Holland...
And, of course, all of this is only coincidence and unfailed!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's support is indignant!
From the extent I could read, the VA's article only makes the boxer gone.
I've even laughed so much that was big.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chances to break because journalists are not "astraints" in the secret of the sources, isn't it?
In the difference that there is no consciousness between VA and the power while there is a concience between the power and the World journalists for a operation against a opposer.
I should not be the only one to wait for a explaining of the World on the ground and on its dangerous relationships.
We are well in front of a state scandale that would in any other democracy cause the fall of the government involved.
Where is this editorial to the aboys, which long says about complication with the current government.
It's not a question of left or right, it's more serious.
I would have thought the oil would be good with the smoke hareng!
It's just for the numbers and to reduce the salaries and create housing problems, I'm sure if I was an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents came here, I would have doubted about the issue of immigration, but this is not a reason to resist controls.
One of the most sensitive persons in the BBC's emissions on immigration was a Sikh of second generation who said that she was at the same time with the number of people who entered and the changes they had made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not all cooperating, even to give suppers simply because of the woman's religion, he also made it possible to enter into her place of worship while she claimed that he was not obligated to pray.
** "which said she was not PAS"
As we all know, if we let it do, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whoever imposes limits and contests, it must be admired even if it is a pub manager :) Better for you!
More to the right?
Where are you living?
If this country was more on the left, it would be able.
You think what did the New Labour that was especially left?
The liberalisation of a country, the NHS, this is a repeat, the massive immigration of immigrants (excluding their own terms for the goodness of the right inside), the culture of social benefits, the age of the entirely allowed, the politically right that kills the freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is from the centre of the left and not from the right, I said this to blague, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependents of the State.
It's typical on the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your ready arguments as much as you want, but what I asked you is specific examples of left politics, or a link programme defensed by the Government of New Labor.
Can you do that?
With all my respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what she had done to her the New Labour which was particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you accepted it and changed what you asked.
Yes, it's the Territory of Tim Bell.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful publisher director of the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with the economic migrants coming in Great Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He had completely reason to do that.
France to French!
We were in 40 45 to fall in another distraction, the money.
We'll make beautiful economies by seeing these technocrates...
We should renew the treaties.
Or, renewments, and if the word "democracy" in another sense in Europe, what should it not be done?
It is concerned that the committee is not concerned about the disloyal tax competition between countries in relation to companies.
This must be unnecessary quantity.
Europe is not the solution, it's the problem...
The EU has only a goal, it is to make the rail transport sector completely goods.
In terms of terms, this means that the whole French territory of bread will not be served by the rail.
The abandonment of which are already victims of many territory will only strengthen themselves.
All sacrifices, including the adventure of a country, on behalf of the liberal dox, I don't seem to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be well-treated once.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and means to put the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has been released for a long time.
The regions have the impression to pay for nothing but not the way to contrary the sf to respect its commitments.
Or use of public money without garage is essential in our days where resources are restricted.
And great needs.
I don't see very well what the TER competition could be!
Is there another problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be a loving head?
I think you haven't really succeeded to distinguish the problems that existed during the marriage and that, of course, you're always going to end pain and anger now than five years have passed.
Obviously, having an ex-alcool living so close to you and having what is to be a daily impact on your life is extremely difficult.
That's what, it seems to me feel sensitive to start the separating process between your life and the complications you have inherited.
It seems like that's what they do, but it seems an enemy.
Because you all live so close to each other and that complications are possible to endure while news make surface, have you thought of a “flight plan ” so that you can make a break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a coherent immobiliar credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
He's got a vindicative and persistent look.
Why not go to a family consultative group to say things openly and to provide him a support to help him re-employ the work and pay food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is done much more than the time you've passed with your ex.
Very good counsel.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meet the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not keep his promises on contact and ask them to consider how it would make them feel and how they will handle the deception if he does not keep his meetings.
Try to keep a contact with their father.
If they see that you do this for their good, despite your own feeling because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop to love you and if you do everything you can to easily easily make a father/child continue, they will know who thanks when they will be greater.
I think that children end by understanding who's wrong, if we let them see things by themselves.
Go to another little effort you're close to Godwin point.
In 30 to 40 years, civilization will disappear, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the earthquake against iron pool.
Moreover, with globalization, the country in the least social, fiscal, but also environmental has a competitive advantage, and others are obligated to follow.
All that politics seek is growth, the Crossance.
It'd have to be a international organization, but from here...
This is not the C02 climatosceptic.
These are all those who shooting, those who use the climate, those who take the air or car, those who live in apartments that you have to build, those who buy industrial products that you have to produce and transport.
These are not the climatosceptics that have manifested against the rubber, but the carriers.
No policy is climatisceptive and Arnold S consumes much more than me.
But nobody says that climate is more than CO2 than other.
Environment defenders also move for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be enough.
Political actions are also needed (other energy sources, reduction of dependence towards car, etc.).
And politicians are partly acting in accordance with their electorate's powers.
"I'll be back" is actually a glorious promise of McArtur on 11 March 1942 when he is Philippines.
Terminator just restarted the expression.
But it may be the humor to say that the expression is of Terminator.
"Lower gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the lock effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but every good apostle of the dogma of the RCA knows what it is.
Nobody knows what it's just the lock effect?
Bingo of Guardian: How long before someone puts the fault on the immigration?
I'm putting the fault on the crapule that took all the money.
Are we counting Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'll call my five dollars.
I'm putting the fault on the democratic mentors.
Or the democratic scrocks.
Or the lyers of the Labor.
We're wrong, they're responsible.
The movement of populations could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinic cases that run into a car or a plane to escape the epidemic are only to move the infection faster than they can imagine.

Small, actually!
Don't use the immigration word, you'll be afraid of the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on the immigration to pay all our retraits, to take care of our old, to clean their hygiene bassins, to bury the 30 000 people who die every year of hypothermia or hungry, (not forget your lake and goodness, which allow you to rebuild you, to eliminate the chauffage AND to eat this sandwich on the road).
Don't happen so much.
The non-controlled and tested immigration will lead Ebola in Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a black (mauvais) or is it not excited?
It's more comfortable...
This is how the public money is broken to allow a deep minority of individuals to pass a good time in the space to make galpets and to play clowns before TV cameras.
Thus, the reality has found nothing, and the authorities will certainly expect a baby to be designed there to flame the world and to raise the median coverage to west royalties used to the tabloids' maternity.
Maybe they would have to go back on the ground to find that we're bossing here!
In contrast with what you believe, we don't send men or women to the space to make galpets or clowns, but to work.
And these travels are very useful for mankind in general.
And this, in all areas.
Many things that improve our day are issues of space research.
So yes, it's the money costed usefully.
You can cite one thing that improves our day and issue of space search.
It's just a fucking bullet.

Shortly, working for work doesn't mean anything and represents even vacuum.
Oh, if the last played high tech.
After the infim minority of individuals who go into the space, there are several decades of thousands of others who work for what it is possible.
You know, people who buy what, including more and more private enterprises, especially to achieving the charge to the station.
If you think you're buying a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't think to buy a plastic gun now but who have the possibility to buy it in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to meet people to believe that it is a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very unreasonable article, it would have done bad to the author/editor than to put a photo of the "sword" in question instead of general photos of "swords in plastic"?
Or even to be quite interesting to ask yourself what the inscription (which is the case) was above?
The bad typical reporting, it is said that "This is only a plastic sword" and not the inspiring jiadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of the Shiit Islam.
In contrast, the Dirani family is a shit musulman born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups who are trying to cause governments to fall, and in Iraq they are almost solar muslims.
If only people would stop riding on the fact that plastic cottons are inoffensif.
In famous hands, they can be dead.
Even the small covers in the quick rests can be cut off the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common discorative object, it justifys the ridicule that the author gives him.
Not the pain to try to make a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts as you mentioned them actually support his argument.
At the moment, I saw these discorative objects in museum houses, or painting on the walls, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Good Jesus, you're right.
And that takes all his sense now...
I saw that guy looking like to be from the Middle-Orient to Kebab Stop and distributing plastic cottons to anybody all night!
I love the conclusion very much.

And it is impossible to benefit from new generations of frustration.
For example, call the Energy Solidarity, which allows you to isolate the combs of a house for 1 symbolic€ when it is inhabited by a modesty household (the costs of travel are supported by actual energy providers!).
Easy but not known even if more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting this PES.
But I never heard.
Who can call it, and how does that work?

The study shows that a family of 4 persons can reduce 30% of its water factory ( 150 m3/an to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water economy per year, keeping the same comfort.
This is not a crisis of the application, it is a crisis of the system that no longer comes to produce enough over (which then would have re-distributed as a form of income growth in real terms) to pay the increase of the expenditure you are classified in the category "restricted expenditures".
In other words, energy preservation is "just" the turn of the medal that the economy doesn't get to grow as soon as she would.
Note that the theory (neo-) classic of the economy is totally unable to answer such a question, because for it there is no internal limit to economic growth, and there is no element that can be contrary, more increasingly decades after decade, the economic growth rythme.
From its definition, energy is that allows all transformation.
Since producing, in general, is transformation, energy is allowed to achieve the smallest economic production (good or service).
And more we want to produce, more energy needs.
This means that any restriction to the increase in energy gain (indirectly called "Energy production"), even in the form of a growth of its price, covering its production to increase (excluding to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not rentable if energy is not quite nice).
Immediately, there is a very strong link between energy preservation and the fact that it is, or not, to increase the "production" of unclean energy.
And data very officially provided, for example, by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only be able to take place in the years and decades coming (the AIE, in these recent reports, indicates that it has been achieved in 2008 in the production of conventional oil, understanding, unclean oil.
And the oil is the most universal energy form, because its very strong energy density, its transport and manipulation and storage facility, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work any performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back, so it equals things.
Take this to France!
vote No. 18.
Are you a guardian's webmaster?
As it was noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
In fact, good work for guys.
Although many people like to moving from Scotland when they do only lose, there is nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tours when they come to qualify themselves, at least until they make themselves eliminate in the first round.
It is still more strict if we play against them ;)
England begins to worry about me.
Because, now that the "born shige generation" comes back, they may have a decent team with all these youths.
; Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the XI department, why do you change a team that wins?
The only footballer, who, in my humble opinion, really was "international class", is David Beckham, a little exhausted, perhaps, but I think if he tackled a patate in overweight like me, he would be able to stick me completely.
People forget his athletic constitution, otherwise, speaking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I'm never moving Scotchs.
I have tend to surprise by watching their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of evening...
The only footballer who, in my humble opinion, really was "international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people often forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is sure that Juppe would be bad to ask $100,000 for a Conference in South Korea.
And not sure he would get them if he asked them...
You mean, people are coming to make a good course?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on its rewards of ladies...
I particularly ask me to know what he can tell in his conferences.
How to reduce his deficit?
How to return to full employment?
I would say that no serious conference of a scientific discipline, any of its scientific levels, even if he is a holder of a Nobel price, will not think to ask for a minimum sum.
Conferences with content are most free or almost time.
And I can assure you that these young people work really and that the results presented in their grateful conferences are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is building.
The conferences of researchers are even paying by the lab!!!!
It's to say...
Everything lights for me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a valuable representative of the UMP ethics.
Do I have the impression that we're reproaching him to win money?
I'm far from being one of his fans, but we're reproaching him of having a bad (or fraudulently) management of his campaign OK.
But to make conferences is to be a very real activity.
In order to make the comment in Nina, let us remember that its movements are supported by the contributors.
Rule No 1 of the epidemiology: isolation.
All American and British flights to or to Africa should have been suspended for weeks ago.
Human life is more important than the right political.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other possible places.
What density of population infection is that politicians will decide to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the aircraft for Spain, and then I represent an aircraft from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola empires in Western Africa, I see them well forbid all flights and battles in the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that says...
What damage that the international media panic on Ebola is no longer used to speak of less spectacular health crisis but more mortal that touch the people of West Africa.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It's a journalist article so trist, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (all as relevant): Women are the first careful - read - men travel from a community to another, etc.
Such more intelligent comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where all of us can contribute to better understanding and interpretation of cultural and social approaches, and differences in sex role that could help combat Ebola in Western Africa.
Come on, let's get there, think and write, we don't like to do a voice.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and a smart opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I would put the female genital mutilation on the same range as the decapitation - a form of terrorism as barbaric, its survival rate only makes a different form of torture - say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is of Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case, obviously, it does not give a better perspective than the one of a medium activist in the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was “making ” as a worldwide resource of journalism in the 21th century, extending its fundamental prescriptions.
Who, in the editorial team, let this appear?
For a territorial or other election the money doesn't count.
I read without prejudice that the territorial function increases its effectiveness, and I have never seen a article giving them the word or trying to explain why.
It would be realistic , actually .
There will be lies without doubt and truths to us to separate the good grain of the jinn .
The court of the accounts is nice to tell so many economic niasseries.
It's true that they never had anything to manage people from Cambon Street.
CTs are not in deficit, they have financial needs that can only be concerned and only the investments they make.
In force to use too flexible concepts of press as the World plays all obscurance.
The debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, the debt finances especially the costs of operation...
And as the overbound of officers (for example, to make fine round points) leads to a growing and incompressive load (flow load until their death, since life-retrait work), these collectivities are in the investment.
It is therefore necessary to remove the status of officers, pre-award to the decree of the funds.
And also financially acquire the masters.
It is fabulous that intercommunities should comply with a decrease of common effects, and it is the inverse thing that happens, showing that re-equality is not effective without deleting others.
How do you want to correctly manage large territories like cacahuets at the time of the TGV and car?
The time of the horse when these territory were created is revolved, maybe it's time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to stay prisoned, worst enclosed, in the administrative toilet, would it seem to be!
Let's even try up, It's not too strong to explain the situation of blocking to which the state of the Vème has led with her providers.
This really started with Peter.
Then he continued to go to the series "by the end of the suffle" coming strongly.
Why are they not going to live in a apartment of 250 million dollars in Monaco over a cinema to leave all this soffrance behind them?
Europe is also built on a cimeter, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people take care of themselves?
Do not even try the answers of the type "is the fault of white."
'reply' not 'reply'
I sincerely hope that it's a sarcasm.
It was in my post, if it wasn't clear enough.
That's what happens when we move to be the first.
Whether or not, there is an argument to pass.
It is now agreed that the modern Homo Sapiens has developed in North East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and in a particular humid period about 150 thousand years ago they have succeeded to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the eight thousand years) is part of the history.
The current Minister of Defence had stated that no military hospital would be closed a few months ago.
So he lied.
It was certainly the only government who seemed to keep the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
Excuse me!
in 2017:Transformation in a comfortable hotel of placers for future retraits from the Republic?
Beginning of the ship dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a physician for nantes and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed doctor.
We're gonna economise money and the military will take care of the grippe of the little else...
Do you know that 70% of the patients are civilians, all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I have mercy on their fans based on Wycombe/Londres.
Like London Irish and London Welsh?
They left the "Londry" last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the inverse.
Moreover, movements outside for the Tigers and the Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the misunderstanding to be buyed by the Sale Sharks, and we ended by praising our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I was supposed to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training on the area, although they had access to other locals, we have no favour.
I like supporting Coventry City.
Good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has no bad supporters and who has recently been at the top for more than 30 years, to see his stage recovered by a rugby club.
I have aware of the recent problems of the CCFC, but this must be a good guilt.
For my part, I'm not the club's rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except a few Wasps fans at work.
Each and a few thousand others in the South East will certainly follow them far or will they now have to support another team?
Good article pro-domo and good vulgarization.
But who's concerned about it?
But why not all information systems are based on these concepts?

The travels of G.

We should stop (the media) of such persons, who work for the good of mankind.

But these people do not sell it.
Real time information has become a key sector in many areas, and few are those who know the intime details of these processes.
It's 15 years ago I didn't go to a Olive Garden.
The quality-prix report has expired.
I'm sorry for those who're going to lose their job, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There are too many salts in our food regimes.
Don't ask Olive Garden to not put salt in the future.
It seems that they reason with Faisons more benefits, and not Faisons of healthier places and the best quality-prise report.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, take care of that people don't have too much gressin.
And then let's make our supper by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there is full of salt inside, it replaces the real ingredients.
We'd like to make a little natrium glutamate.
The quantity of salt that you have to hold in the water of the powder is unnecessary, but it wellifys the go of the product finished.
This is not only the go of the salt, but it also affects the way they cook.
The product finished is so much better.
Without sole, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to the business kitchen.
Is there family restaurants and offers famous places for reasonable prices?
What happens in the United States is very trist.
A banal accident of work that was wrongly turned.
A young promising, furnished teacher followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man had all gone and brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
To be condemned at 10 years of prison, it seems to be the minimum.
Where are we going?
Completely agreed!
What a humor!
The desire to cover it is evident and hardly excusable and blameable at the same time...
In fact, the sending of covering it is hardly excusable.
That's why I have a certain sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the proceedings, the father of the Family claimed to never see his son again but without asking for forgiveness to the neighbors of the guy he killed himself.
Who's really victim in this story?
What are you coming to meet!!
The father of the Age was condemned for what he did.
With regard to the conner of lost balls, the accused and accusable, he knew just well that the balls were dangerous.
The guy did nothing to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime that he is responsible!
10 years, it's a little much to me.
For having the intelligence to take this young man to make a voice?
Really, it's been a voice!
If the opportunity is present, go to vacation in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winners.
This makes me do it twice, wine, landing and food are excellent.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many vineyard festivals that are in each community, it is still better.
I'm sorry, the Mosaic Valley, I'm too quick.
It pleases to see that German wine is recognized.
Instead, German winners use traditionally only one variety of rain, which means that they must really be hard to keep a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations make experiences with different rains, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is only the region of the Moselle that must be recommended - France, the Palatinat Renan (Pfalz), Baden deserves to be visited.
A French interesting region is Alsace, which is like a mix between Germany and France.
The wine is from German (or maybe it's the inverse, fast).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after eating.
Knowing the popularity of sack whites during food, they now offer much, and with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9 degrees.
But their traditional wine bottled to property are so complex, the doctor is very balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatles with a thermidor howard next time you're going to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good choice.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine of Hugh Johnston is a good guide, greatly illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers from Guardian who cover the wine, but this is a recape of each journal article on the German wine since the night of the time.
At the other time, there is an article on the German wine that is going to come, the new secs of Baden who are now going to join the plates, the red that are strangely vigourous, but especially, that are not those Liebfraumilch dego's that people drink when they were young (heu, I really don't think that it's still true or evocator, except if I'm addressing me to more than 40 years - which, as I say, will already have seen all of this).
Close the Val de Grace would be a great error and an illustration of the lamentable state in which the French Administration is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a pine in the foot of my grandfather's back and my grand-father's back, who have done their studies there.
In democracy, it is necessary to submit the management of health to the vote of the ladies' room: these ministerial campaigns held by the barbecue, and these closed decisions have become unsupportable.
Sorbogroin's right.
It should be done as in the Vert Soleil: euthanation at 70 years.
Moreover, we could revenge the meat that will feed our poor (sic) actives because they can't go to the market anymore.
Actually, find a job to our unemployment, the real work, and you will have no more deficit problems!
For elderly people, it was time to pay a little more because national solidarity is not able to provide...
Assets, in the way of disappearance, will not be able to keep this demographic transition only...
So of the geriatrium, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of 30 glorious ones.
Now, the maximum growth of 1,5% (that is already the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to repeat all the model set after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of the excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigorous and discipline known more in the hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
We're fucking crazy because the rest of hospitals is not at the height.
The scandal is that presidents and other elections are able to take care otherwise than at the hospital.
The solution is more in the increase of the service offer in other hospitals than to keep a doctor at two speeds.
The Val is a French pharmaceutical pool, and clearly a symbol.
Closing would be a mistake, a sign of more walking to the mediacrite of France.
Without speaking of military status, it must be kept absolutely.
"The Hospitalisation Day Price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Minister with local supervision of the Regional Agencies of Hospitalisation.
The affliction of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously the baby is only one of these economic re-reserved resources, he came in to have a better paid job than the one he had with him.
In almost all the countries of the world, a child born in this country of two non-citoyen parents is almost always uncitoyen.
Australia is far far away than most countries by making children born by Australian residents of citizens.
But this is Australia that is criticized because it does not respond to certain highly noticed standards, with evident difficult consequences.
Why?
It seems to take two weights of two measures.
Env° Abbott in the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, to end all perseverance and maltraining and war that makes people in their country escape and forces them to come to seek help.
If he doesn't want people to come through a ship, then we need to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to do about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war was 26 years old, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, war ended six years ago, and the country returned to the normal.
Everything takes his sense now, Nimrod...!
Wonderful that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe this little superchey when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron announced war crimes and crimes that still occurred.
Many European countries have already suspended the deportations of the Tamouls with a link to the ETTEs, thinking that they would cover a risk of torture in their return.
The UNHCR reviewed its guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with link to the ETTE be considered as a risk at their return.
The year [2013] has seen a number of attacks by Buddhist military groups against Hindu and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial advice were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, your coco has gone with so much p'dic.
Actually, this guy couldn't even get a chance to do it.
Didn't he have a health in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who will pay for the medical expenditure during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas maybe, unless some labs pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Especially in Texas
Ah!!!!!!!!!!!
There was a few years ago, we were explained that the ebola kills so quickly that a big increased epidemie was impossible ( there is all a scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of counterparty of returned persons was no.
More we're weird, more I'm afraid.
You have to read fun magazines to believe that a risk may be no.
Small or even three low but not no.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, more a virus is deadly (generally) less he has the chance of spreading himself because the death of the host signs his own death.
The combination of the 2 (height transmission and fast death) sometimes comes out of the Spanish dead grippe.

There is nothing obscene to do in front of the mediatics of certain good and vertuous oils, but in the detriment of thousands of other African sicknesses who were not known to the medium, or the bravoure, or the vertus?
Of course, this lights the actions of the NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repeat of the announcements is of a terrible partiality.
Freedom of expression, so loved for conservators.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott, weapons brothers attacking the freedom of expression and the right to the private life of the people.
I guess they have never imagined that their conservators would have lost them from their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I guess there's a man who's not gonna do it next time.
Yes, this is exactly what we need at this time, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A chauffing tour for when the problem will really become out of control.
There are no longer enough doctors working in the regions around Australia.
Tony Abbott's share in the “government” against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new finish market fund for medical research, which should reach $20 billion from 2020, would be only a black box of emergency for the budget.
By using the pretext of the noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as a general income.
I hope the Australian voters will come to see this excellent russe for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we don't want to believe.
It explains that Medibanke's sale is acquired by the Finish Market Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for diseases, a loss for elderly and a loss for low income people.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not just.
Finally, the "Lighter Roger" and its Market Fund at the end of Telstra were excellent tutors.
If that's not just, let's show Abbott who's smart.
Envelop it in hell to the next choice.
The most terrible for Nadine is even the "ancient personality", saurous....
I also noted it, very corruptly as noted.
Only if it could disobey her to get a buzz on her constantly.
The worst destination for a carrier policy: not recognised in the street.
Hello, she wasn't recognised in her town of Toul as adequate height to administrate her.
How good the good sense of “province ” is!
We've lived a hateful time, ma'am Morano.
I'm sure against the port of Burqa, but this is not the question.
What this anecdote is the sarcosism in the pure state: small median letters with the range of ministers, a confusion between the government and the executional function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on each actor of the road to show that he is well guarded by the public order), the grossness and the unrequiredness of their maximum degree.
I propose that the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all these “ancient persons” become desirable to bring a fire-in-law, and they would have all the pleasure to exercise their auto-proclaimed function of judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
It is actually the main teaching of the matter: even the police turned the page of Sarkozy, maybe they don't even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it becomes crazy for him.
I sent this agent who ignored the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the time
I don't agree, thanks to her, we're looking good ...!
Nadine, if she doesn't exist, he'd have to wait for it!
However, it's easy, she's staying in Christine Boutin with a blonde perruck.
In this case, N.
Morano obviously made in the mistreat effectively, in the degree of the police officer she had before her, and who would certainly have had to multiplie the corbetes and the "Yes Madam, of course, Madam, immediately tell me Madam in which direction I must run to take me without waiting for this whistle woman."
“ In one of the cases, the Super Hornets of Australia left a air attack on a target of Jesus when the risk of killing civilians became too important... ”
The Americans are not bad to this, but I think that even though Jesus's going to overcome them or have already done it, in Iraq, at least someone's counting the body right now, nobody's doing it.
For civil dead at the industrial scale, nothing implies with the west war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-o≤ls) between the two Iraq wars would have costed life to millions of Iraqs, especially children, elderly and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-government manifestants I knew would prefer the sanctions for the deferring of the “Where Machine”.
Did you also be the type of man who would prefer sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good note - the United Nations has acted incrediblely and unconscious in recent years.
The sanctions are usually ineffective and do not reach the elite - no doubt a reason for which they have the opportunity to approve the safe Security Council.
You may remember that the insects have not lost time to mark their main enemy when they have seen it in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the United Nations Mission's QG that they had committed at least five days ago in Bagdad in 2003.
They struck this place with power and two times and I imagine with satisfaction and blood-freed.
So brutal and hard this bombardement, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission has been targeted like that.
Good note, I really forgot this.
So you have a half million people of the total number of deaths of the Western nations (which at least with recent problems in Ukraine, the economic activity was directly guided to people they intended to hurt).
This helps your argument only to extract notorially unbelievable statistics.
The only five-yearly trustable numbers are the children of children of less than five years and they are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain has left target inspectors to find the facts.
It was obviously in his interest that the negative effects of sanctions were exhausted.
The most reliable estimates that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200 and 400 000, but no one really knows.
As regards additional deaths in other age groups, estimations are not better than hypothesis.
Since the number of pre-sanction dead in less than five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, the number of post-sanctions is a part of this age group.
Of course, we need to fear her, but also the gift of gametes in general.
We need to stop doing as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that we could do them with inconvenience that neither parents nor children may never know, without consequences for them.
One of our funding mythes is Oedipe, 60% of the French are from genealogy.
It's a crucial and disappointed thing to know its origins.
Instead of doing as if it was evident and using fantastic arguments, we should explain the serious problems that could occur for a child adopted or designed with a gate.
If you learn that your parents who have raised you have not provided the gametes you are issued, you could repeat it, in my opinion, because they would not have committed any crime.
The latest progress in the PMA (e.g. greffe) are at least as discussable as a GPA reasoned.
The true question is to me: Is the frustration of children's desire justified these acrobatics, and this does not have anything to do with marriage for all.
Very just as a point.
It is obvious that we need to fear the GPA, what is that stupid question?
Of course, it's trist not to have a child when we want it.
It's a problem I met with my wife.
However, it is less serious than to be born very healed or to become it, to contract a serious disease, to lose all his children in an accident, etc.
Among all life's concerns, that's not the seriousest.
It's a frustration among many others.
This doesn't stop living.
And we can always take care of children of others!
In a company that does not support any form of frustration anymore, where the child becomes a good consumption, the GPA is unacceptable for me.
The desire of the child is not a caprice where we could use the other one’s good desire.
The sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
