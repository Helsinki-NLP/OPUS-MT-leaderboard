Quick increase in the cumulated incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/The European Economic Space and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) shows a similar development in the European Union/the European Economic Space and the United Kingdom, confirming that, despite different stages, the COVID-19 pandemy is rapidly progressed in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must be prepared for a few patients with COVID-19 needing care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a home of an unknown ethology pneumonia was reported to Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Prevention and Control Centre designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known under the name of Coronavirus 2 of the severe acid respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since the disease resulting from infection in SARS-CoV-2 has been baptized with coronavirus (COVID-19).
Today, about 80% of COVID-19 people have a blessed affection, etc., with or without pneumonia infection, most of which are healing.
In approximately 14% of the cases, COVID-19 has a severe incidence needing hospitalisation, while 6% of remaining cases develop a serious form of illness needing intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In the framework of this study, we evaluate the development of the cumulative impact of the COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/the European Economic Space (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (R.-U.) and compare it to the development of the province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EE and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cas de COVID-19 in EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom
In China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemy in the rest of the world is currently followed by the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 was a pandemy.
In the Edition of 5 March 2020, Spiteri and al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe after the definition of WHO cases.
Inside the EU/EEE, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom (R.-U.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1 727 deaths, including 17 750 cases and 1 441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtainment of the cumulated number and cumulated incidence in cases of COVID-19
In the European Prevention and Control Centre (CEPCM), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country throughout the world, only received from official sources such as health ministers, national and regional health authorities of different countries and the WHO is updated at 08:00 a.m.
These data were used to evaluate the evolution of the COVID-19 in the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, and to set a comparison with Italy's experience.
In order to evaluate the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we have calculated the cumulated incidence at 14 days of the cases of COVID-19, taking into account the natural development of the COVID-19, within each EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, for the period of 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the total number of cases reported in each country to 15 March 2020 to 8 hours to the data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of the COVID-19 in the EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom
The development of the incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EE and the United Kingdom generally followed the province of Hubei (Chine) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of the COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This evolution was mainly due to the rapid evaluation of the number of cases reported in Italy, but all the other EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom had a similar increase in the cumulative impact of the COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 provides the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom in comparison with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, on 15 March to 8 a.m., 15 other countries of the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks ago.
Our results indicate that the number of cases reported by COVID-19 increases rapidly within the EU/EE and the United Kingdom.
The development of the cumulated impact of the COVID-19 suggests that pandemy progresses with a comparable speed in all countries.
And, despite the fact that the countries are different and that there are differences in the responses of national health services, potential variations in the definitions of cases and differences in the patient selection protocols to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, including for rattrage tests.
In early March 2020, the Italian doctors indicated that about 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data relating to the admission of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and/or in intensive care services are currently available at EU/EEE scale for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (not presented data).
However, a systematic collection is needed to be completed in order to complete the current monitoring data on the number of cases reported and death.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in the intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, from 29.2 beds for 100.000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100.000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modelization scenarios relating to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with a risk & gt; 90 % of the intensive bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid evaluation of the COVID-19 risks.
Since cases were grouped until then in certain regions of the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services are generally accompanied by a defined regional population, data on cases and seats should be set at the level 2 of the statistical territorial units nomenclature (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and the current development in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemy is rapidly progressing within the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore be prepared for a Community transmission scenario supported by SARS-CoV-2 and to increase the number of patients with COVID-19 needing care, especially intensive care, such as in Italy's affected regions.
As highlighted by the recent rapid evaluation of the risks of the CEPCM, a quick, proactive and exhaustive approach is essential to endure the propagation of SARS-COV-2, with an adjustment approach to an attainment approach, as soon as the rapid and preliminary heating of the number of cases may not allow sufficient time to the decisions and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented.
The rapid evaluation of risks also reflects health measures to achieve the impact of pandemy.
There is a short window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to enhance SARS-CoV-2 propagation and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without prejudice, health systems in the other EU/EEE countries must face a few patients needing intensive care in the future days or weeks.
The disease epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 of the severe acid respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has even caused more than 3 000 deaths and infected more than 80 000 people in China and other in the world, providing humanitarian catastrophes.
As its authorised, SARS-CoV, which led thousands of SRAS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by shoes and providing similar symptoms through similar mechanism.
However, the COVID-19 presents a severity and a less mortality than the SRAS, but it is much more transmissive, and it more affects older people than young and more men than women.
In response to the rapid review of the number of publications on this extreme disease, this article is trying to provide a suitable and exhaustive examination of this subject of research.
We will reach the epidemiology, ethology, virology, the treatment, the pronostic and the prevention of disease.
Although many questions are still expecting answers, we hope that this examination will participate in better learning and eradicating this serious disease.
The Premium Festival on 25 January 2020 marked forever the Chinese, who have seen commitments to remain closed for the entire time of the Gold Week and for longer other weeks because of the propagation of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly approved by the coronavirus (CoV) which causes a severe aguous respiratory syndrome epidemic (SRAS) in 2003; therefore SARS-CoV-2 was baptized by the World Health Organization (OMS) on 11 February 2020 and associated disease named Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan and rapidly spread to the whole China before he spread nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 cases confirmed by COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients who were hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For the WHO, COVID-19 is "the enemy number 1", perhaps more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.iscebi.nlm.ni.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 travellers have been held on the COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, ethology, ethology and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, with the sequence of the virus isolated from several patients.
This review tries to synthesize the progress of research on this new subject in full sense.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SRAS and another coronavirus disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, a epidemic occurred in 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned until now in terms of prevention and prognosy of disease, and we will address some issues still in suspension but even urgent.
Coronavirus is traditionally considered as non-mortal patogenes for Humans, mostly caused by about 15% of the common ranges 4.
However, during this century, we met two highly pathogenic coronavirus for the Human, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused a epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively before spread rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and death.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemy of coronavirus in the recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1, pneumonia houses were reported on 31 December 2019 to Wuhan with the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of coronavirus was devoted.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighborhood countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals were infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quaranty with interruption of its public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 cases confirmed, only 21 patients were directly contacted with the Wuhan sea fruit market, considered as the point of department of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified the world health emergency epidemic.
At the time of this report, the disease has already been spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries throughout the world (Fig.2).
As the situation is quickly developed, the final portrait and the severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8 866 patients, whose 4 021 cases were confirmed by COVID-19, presented an updated view of epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all age, but mostly in the 30-65-year-old tranche.
Nearly half (47.7 per cent) of infected people were over 50 years old, very fewer than 20 years, and only 14 were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 was more infected by men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and in periferia.
The average time between appearance of symptoms and COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time between the appearance of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (IC to 95 %: 3.51-4.05), and the R0 adjusted was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, which coincides with the mass movements that occurred before the Premium Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (IC to 95%: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality of patients was 3.06% (IC 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (human), age (≥ 60) and a severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus constitutes a subfamily of large developed viruses containing a simple RNA.
They can be classified in four types, namely alpha, beta, and delta, coronavirus with Property to infect the man belonging to the alpha and beta types.
Spike (S) of the envelope is the enzyme for the conversion of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell recipients for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, then a membranaryfusion occurs.
The viral ARN genema is released in the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral gene, the genemic RNA associated with anchor glycoproteine and nucleocapside proteins forms of veticals containing virions, which then combine with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% of genetic identity between 10 seed samples produced on the origin site of the epidemic, the market of Huanan sea fruit in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the transmission electronic microscope, SARS-CoV-2 partitions have been detected in ultrafinal sections of human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S lies to ACE2 less stronger than the SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less important infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could play a role in the pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of the IFNb; however, orf8 does not contain functional areas or motives.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and al., presented the Cryo-ME ACE2 full human structure in a resolution of 2,9 Å in complex with the transporter of amino acids B0AT.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed compliance, was gathered in a form of dimmer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two proteins S, which provides indications for coronavirus and infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for the rubber of medicines for elimity infection in SARS-CoV-2.
The original host and the intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were coming from shoes and that they were transferred to the Human through the civets and camelides respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, the cheaps were advanced as the SARS-CoV-2 Native host, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SRAS coronavirus from cow-souris named bath-SL-CoVZX45 and bath-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to browse the barrier of species to infect the Human remains unknown, and the way of transmission is still to be elected.
Ji, and al., issued the hypothese that the virus could have been transmitted to the Human by the serpents, which would include an approved recombination within the protein S.
According to a study conducted by Guangzhou researchers in China, the Pangolin - a long muscle mammifer that feeds of firemis, often used in Chinese traditional medication - may be the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host if the genetic genetic homeology is judged by 99% between a coronavirus covered by the Pangolins and the SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % between two genemens is a significant difference; it should therefore be expected of concluding results that allow concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in secure environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
The SARS-CoV-2 would be sensitive to ultraviolet rayons and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ether, the ethane of 75 %, the chloride-based disinfectants, the peractic acid, the chloroform and other grass solvents, but not the chlorhexidine, can effectively inactive the virus.
The population hum’s population in its own is generally depoured of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other coronavirus studies, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
Generally, when a virus infects a host, it is recognised by the inner immune system by the receptors of molecular motives (PRR), including the C lectini receptors, the type Toll (TLR), the NOD recipients (NLR) and the RIG-I recipients (RRR).
By various ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferons that limit the propagation of the virus and accelerate the phagocytose macrophage of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may allow virus to avoid immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against virus.
Lymphocytes T, in particular T CD4+ and CD8+, play a significant role in defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells that produce specific anticorps from the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of the T cells by inducing their apoptose.
Mutual immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and anticorps, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated anticorps from a retable patients have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a immune system's reaction causes a localised explosion of the number of free radicals, which can cause serious lesions to poultry and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, a multivissary disaster, even death.
Infection in SARS-CoV-2, characterised by a home appearance, is more likely to affect older people with comerbidity and adult women.
It is consciously admitted that people exposed to a large number of viruss or whose immune functions are compromised are more dangerous to be infected than others.
It is considered that the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, but more generally from 3 to 7 days after a study in the 425 first cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study conducted in 1 099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days in average, for a feed from 0 to 24 days.
A recenter study, as described above, has concluded at an incubation period of 4,8 days (3,0-7,2) after a demography of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine after the most precise incubation period to prevent infected but asymptomatic persons from transmitting the virus.
Generally, persons exposed to, or infected by, the virus are put in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended at 24 days?
The fever often consists of the first and main symptom of the COVID-19, and can be accompanied or not of other symptoms such as a sucking tough, a slaughter, muscle pain, disturbance, a head pain, a grass pain, a rhinoree, a thoracic pain, a diarree, nausea and weapons.
Some patients have presented a dyspnee and/or hypoglycaemia one week after the disease occurred.
In the case of serious cases, patients developed rapidly an acid respiratory syndrome, sectical choc, metabolic acid and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, as well as those who have a acid fever, even in the absorption of thoracic radiography anomalie, must be tested for the virus to allow an earlier.
A demographic study finally carried out in December 2019 showed that the diseases had 98% hepatitis, 76% sugar, 55% dyspnee and 3% diarrhee; 8% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Similar conclusions were reported by two recent studies conducted on a family and on a home after the transmission of a virus from a asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of the patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), a sugar tox (47%) and a dyspnee (55%).
However, 80% needed a ventilational assistance, whether more than patients with COVID-19, which is coherent with a higher letality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
A diarrhee (26 %) and a fat pain (21 %) was also observed in patients with MERS.
As regards SRAS, the main symptoms were fever (99 %-100%), sugar tox (29 %-75 %), dyspnee (40-42 %), diarrhee (20 %-25 %) and green disease (13 %-25 %), and a ventilatory assistance was necessary for approximately 14-20 % of patients.
On 14 February, the mortality of the COVID-19 was 2 %, for 66 576 cases confirmed at the world scale.
Similarly, SRAS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8 096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality was 37% for 2 494 cases confirmed.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6,47 with a confidential interval (IC) to 95 % of 5.71-7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of the SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in the Table Table
The above statements suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less letal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemies than it was for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemies.
The appearance of a house often interacts within a family or within a race or a vehicle, such as in the case of a cross.
Patients often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected regions, or were contacted with infected persons or patients in the two weeks with the appearance of symptoms.
However, it was demonstrated that individuals may be virus portors without so much to present symptoms for more than two weeks and that retable patients may be renewed to virus portors, which highlights the need to increase the duration of caranti.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of periferic white globules (including limfocytes) in the first stages.
For example, a lymphopedia with a number of white globules < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase as a viruse was identified in 1 099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had hepatic hepatic enzymes, muscle enzymes and high myoglobin in the blood, and most of them had an elevation of C-reactive protein and erythrocytary sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the D-dimmer rate, the current fibre degradation product was high, and the number of limfocytes was progressively reduced.
Toracic radiography anomalies are detected in most patients with COVID-19, characterised by bilateral inequality shadow or a depolated glass opacity at powder level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, a ligue pulmonary lesion and a aige respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, an uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis are seriously compromised with gas exchanges.
Disfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease of surface rate and increased surface pressure, thus reduces the capacity of pulmonary powder to gone and increases the risk of pulmonary apsus.
Thus, the most concerned toracic examinations often coincide with the severe form of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a disqualification of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, the interstitial lymfocytation and the presence of multinucleated sync cells in the poultry of a patient determined from disease, which coincides with the pathology of virus infection and SDRA and appears to the patients with SRAS and MERS.
The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RN was used as the main criteria for COVID-19.
However, because of the high rate of false negative rate, which can accelerate epidemic, the clinical manifestations began to be used for the LUC (which then was not only on the RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation was observed for SRAS.
Thus, combination of medical anticipations, clinical manifestations, laboratorial tests and radiological tests is essential and imperative to establish an efficient.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a SHERLOCK technology application protocol based on CRISPR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the identification of the synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 from 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of test) with a reactive bandel at least one hour, without need of sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technology will enhance consideration and practicality, if its use on clinical specifics would be concluded.
As a result of the lack of experience from the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide support care for patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies already used or proposed for treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Tableau2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressors, steroides, retable patients plasma, Chinese doctors and psychological support.
Even the retable plasma of patients was proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all used to develop anticorps and vaccines against virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is primarily attacked by poultry in a first time and probably, in a small measure, to other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the renal system.
However, disfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat for patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, a respiratory assistance is essential to highlight the symptoms and salvation of life; it includes general oxygenotherapy, high-depth oxygenotherapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, and severity of disease.
Patients suffering with serious respiratory symptoms must receive oxygenation by extracorporal membrane (OMEC), a cardiopulmonary deficiency technique used for the treatment of cardiac or critical respiratory insufficiences.
Moreover, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and sectical chocks, as well as the protection of the functions of living organs, is essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
A immune system reaction was established in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytokinic choc is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNb, IFNb, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokins introduce immune cells to free a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic chocs, especially for serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal anticorps were used to treat cytokinic chocs.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinal chocs include the modulation of the immune response by T cells, IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokines 4 signal suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressors, were widely used in the treatment of SRAS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids have not been beneficial on serious pulmonary lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would lead to serious secondary effects, including a avascular osteonecrose, which thus affects pronostic.
However, the recovery to short short-dose corticosteroid cycles was recommended for patients with a serious form of COVID-19.
At the time of this report, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed yet.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleosid analogue, has been effective in a American patients with COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
The remdesivir also showed a possible inhibition of other viruses to simple ARN, including MERS and SRAS.
In view of these conclusions, Gilead transmitted the component to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
Moreover, baricitinib, interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatment for patients suffering with aigus respiratory symptoms.
A diarrhee, nausea, vomiting, hepatic lesions and other side effects may occur after association with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully controlled.
Plasma of retable patients and anticorps production
Collection of blood to patients who have been healed of a county disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an anti-traditional practice.
In fact, retable patients often have a relatively high rate of anticorps against pathogeneous.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by limfocytes B to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they constitute unique moles in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
The plasma was thus extracted from blood from a COVID-19 group of patients who were healed with COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously reached patients.
Their symptoms have improved in 24 hours, in 日 with a decrease of inflammation phenomena, a reduction of the virus load and a increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, a verification and clarification are necessary to provide this method for a large-scale use until no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, since the therapeutic effects, some inconvenients associated with plasma should be examined carefully.
For example, anticorps can provoke an impulsive stimulation of immune response and cause a symptom of freedom of cytokines, possibly fatal.
The blood anticorps concentration is usually low, and the plasma application to treat seriously sick patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific anticorps quickly to fight a world epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isol B cells of retable patients and to identify genetic codes with relevant anticorps or to search for effective anticorps against the main proteins of the virus.
This would enable rapidly increased production of anticorps.
The MTC is used since thousands of years in China to treat a large variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely reflected on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the MTC theories.
Most of the effective components remain little or not in all cases where it is difficult to extract them and check them, or to know their optimal features.
Currently, because of a specific efficient treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with moderate symptoms or in a serious form of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best health rates of the COVID-19 have been observed in China provinces with the MTC for 87 per cent of their patients, including the province of Gansu (63.7 per cent), the Ningxia region (50%) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the province of Hubei, which had only 30 per cent of patients with the COVID-19, presents the lowest health rate (13 per cent).
However, it is an appropriate comparison because many other effect factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and its employees had a study that compared a treatment using the Western Medicine (MO) and a combination of MO and MTC.
The time of return to a normal body temperature, the time of disappearance of symptoms and the hospitalisation duration was just shorter for the MO+MTC group than only for the MO group.
More impressive, the symptom increase rate (severe) was just lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4 % against 46.2 %) and the mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8 % against 39 %).
However, MTC's efficiency and innocuity remains to be defined by the higher-scale tests and in more centres.
It would also be interested in characterizing the mechanism of action and clarifying the effective components of MTC treatments or their APIs, if possible.
Individuals identified as cases or confirmed by COVID-19 are usually anxious about this highly contagious and mortal disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of anxiety, singleness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxie and tough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insulin induced by corticosteroids, can cause increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the first times of SRAS epidemic, many psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crisis, psychomotive excitation, psychotic symptoms, a confusional state and even self-sufficiency trends.
In the context of the response for health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, the obligation to investigate contacts and put it into account can increase anxiety and lead to certain illnesses against the effects of the county, the quarantine, and the stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be produited to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as cases, people in contact with these populations and any other person in distress.
This psychological support must include training of multidisciplinary teams, communication with regular and precise updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid any contact that is reflected.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupte the transmission chain of animal reserves and human beings infected to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemies caused by extreme viruses.
Efforts were made to develop protein S vaccines in order to produce powerful long-term neutralizing anticorps and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SRAS.
However, the in vivo efficiency of these potential vaccines in elderly people and on the models subject to letal provocation and their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have been initiated yet.
This is probably due to the fact that the SRAS has expired 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported since.
In contrast, MRS's sporading cases and houses continue to be said in the Middle East and in other regions due to the sustainability of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive virus, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticules, particulates appearing to virus and recombinant proteins sub- units, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective in order to control the current epidemic.
However, it is a real challenge due to the important time (18 months in average) necessary to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As this is a extreme disease, COVID-19 just starts its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, sickness is gradually restored without sequels.
However, in the case of SRAS and MERS, the COVID-19 is also associated with a morbidity and a high mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, the establishment of a model of pronostic is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, in particular in the areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies to this point, factors that can be affected or associated with the pronostic of COVID-19 patients are the following (Tabelle 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SRAS' pronostic, and this is also the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects age 30-65, with 47.7 per cent of more than 50 years, a study of 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients with intensive care were more likely to present subjacent comrbidities and complications, and were just older (66 years of age against 51), so suggesting age as a pronostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart lesions and arithmy.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SRAS.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 could also be linked to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to hepatic disfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It is necessary to note that the age and presence of subjacent health problems are strongly corrupt and can interfere with each other.
Anormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein rate (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissual lesions; it was advanced as potential pronostic factor of disease, response to treatment and health.
Correlation between the CRP rate and the severity as well as the Pronocy of the COVID-19 was also proposed.
Moreover, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (≤H), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and cinese creatine (CK) can also participate in establishing pronostic.
These enzymes are largely expressed within several organs, especially at heart and feed level, and are released in case of tissual lesions.
Thus, they are traditionally cardiac or hepatic dysfunction marks.
High clinical symptoms: The results of the thoracic radiography and the time progress of the clinical symptoms must be examined in § with the other elements for the determination of the pronostic and complications of the COVID-19.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressors for infectional diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose use of corticosteroids was largely used for serious SRAS cases, many surgounding have presented a avascular osteonicous asylum resulting in permanent incapacity and median life quality.
Therefore, if necessary, the administration of steroids in patients with COVID-19 should be limited to low dose and short-term.
Psychological stress: As described above, COVID-19 epidemic has caused a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients who often know long-term periods, extreme uncertainty, as well as death of neighbors or other patients.
It is important to propose psychological companion and long-term support in order to help those people overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to demographic studies, COVID-19, presents different epidemiological characteristics of the SRAS.
In addition to responding in the lower respiratory ways, SARS-CoV-2 also reacts effectively in higher respiratory paths and does not draw or little symptoms in the first phase of the infection, instead of coronavirus from the origin of common rays.
Therefore, recently infected persons or incubation periods may produce a large quantity of virus during their daily activities, which results in the control of epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by seriously sick patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and difficult to control that it was not the SRAS.
Great efforts are currently developed in China, including Wuhan's confinement and neighborhood cities, as well as the continuation of the nearly total population in order to interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures had dramatic impact on the economy and other countries, the number of new cases declines, indicating the increase in epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decrease phase will dure from 3 to 4 months.
However, all experts do not share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and al., assume that the COVID-19, which is just more infectious than the SRAS, will not be expelled in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., set a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the proefements of the median nasal cornet and the grass of retable patients, 2 weeks after their outcome from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode in the side of the grippe.
However, in China, a progressive decrease of new cases was observed, suggesting that the implementation strategy would work.
According to the initial previsions, Ebola virus had to lead to a million cases and a half million deaths.
However, through a quarantine and a strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as for the SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 is disabled in terms of infection to finally extermine or develop in a less patogenic virus cohesive with the Human.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SRAS and MERS is provided below (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by toughs or surroundings, and may also by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in cells, thus developing a new potential for feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of the cases were likely caused by nosocomial infections, with 17 patients who had previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
It is therefore necessary to take precautions to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, neighbors and diseases, and even any person who may contact patients or infected persons.
The first defense line possible to reduce the risk of infection is in the face mask port; the use of chirurgical and respiratory masks N95 (1860) involves controlling the propagation of virus.
Chirurgical masks prevent the design of potentially infected goutlets or their depth on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 masks (1860) provide a protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5 % of the vials that can penetrate completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, because both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particules are able to pass five chirurgical masks empiled on each other, it is impatient that health professionals in direct contact with patients have N95 masks (1860s) and not chirurgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must have adjusted isolation blows to further reduce the contact with virus.
Virus can also infect a person by ocular way.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor appeared to have been infected in SARS-CoV-2 while he had a N95 mask; the virus could have penetred his body by ocular way because of inflammation.
As a result, health professionals must also carry out transparency vials or protection lamps in the contact of patients.
For the populations of the regions affected or potentially affected, it is strongly recommended to lay hands with sugar defecting more frequently than normally, to remain limited to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to keep a distance from a meter with the diseases.
These measures constitute effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the propagation of virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high level of gender with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, China must have placed high warning after SRAS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Control and Prevention Centre assured the population by claiming that the new virus was lowly contagious, that it had a limited inter-human transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain disease.
This message led a significant release, especially when the whole country was prepared for the Premium Festival, and the critical opportunity to keep the disease in Wuhan was missing.
Chinese disease control agencies must take lessons and take the measures imposed.
For example, these agencies need to be more active in their announcements, since each word can affect the behavior and the decisions of the population; (2) to demonstrate more efficiency and reactivity towards clinical data than to wait for formal reports of doctors or official events; (3) to demonstrate more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its starts than to try to reassure the population; and (4) to carry out more objective and relevant exercises in order to acquire the population on epidemic diseases, but to test and improve regularly the society's response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started in December 2019.
In less than two months, when the report was published, it extended to China and nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of the COVID-19 are also close to SRAS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as an impression of already-vi.
However, significant differences between COVID-19 and SRAS are observed, which should be taken into account in order to contain epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 is more affected by older people than young and more men than women; the severity and death rates are also more important in elderly people.
The SRAS presents more mortality than COVID-19 (10,91 % against 1,44 %).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is even possible in absorption of symptoms, while SRAS was majorly transmitted by seriously diseased patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the COVID-19 propagation.
This, partly, explains why SARS-CoV-2 was far more rapid and much larger than SARS-CoV.
Regular detection tests of SARS-CoV-2 CARS may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, retable patients may be positive to virus again.
This increases the risk of propagation.
Despite the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain still in suspension, including:
Where's SARS-CoV-2 coming?
Although a genetic approval of 96 % has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two type coronavirus SRAS from cow-souris, it is not sufficient to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus of the original host, such as the shoes-souris, to the Human?
Without response to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to interrupte the transmission effectively, and the epidemic can be repeated at any time.
A molecular modelization and biochemical analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 is read in the ACE2, but how does the virus fit exactly in the respiratory road cells and how does it result in pathological changes?
Does the virus also refer to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and precise or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemie take?
How does the virus develop genetic in the interhuman transmission?
Will he develop in world pandemy, disappear like SRAS or regularly surface as the grippe?
It is essential, even if it can take time, to answer these questions and to many others.
However, the expenditure that this should be done is not important, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible in order to restore the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is lower than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunodepressed patients have severe infection from lower respiratory paths.
The first case of SRAS returns to end 2002 in the province of Guangdong in China.
Without accounting the super-transmittents, it was considered that each case could appropriately generate two secondary cases with a period of incubation between 4 and 7 days, the pipe of the viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected by SARS-CoV first have a myalgie, head, fever, sickness and freshness, dyspnee followers, breathing and respiratory disorders such as late symptoms.
Lymphopedia, false hepatic function tests and high kinase creatines are coherent anomaly observed in laboratorial analyses in case of suspiciousness of SRAS.
Different alveolary lesions, proliferation of epiphelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SRAS.
Thereafter, about 20 to 30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to below respiratory paths, several organs including gastrointestinal paths, fee and renal can also be infected in these serious cases, often associated with cytokinic choc, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Several efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research since.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjoitiveness, fever and bronchiolite is coherent in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a 8-month natal boy suffering of pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in the Netherlands, he is actually present in the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a obstructive laryngite, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized because of a pneumonia and bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
In the case of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, providing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs get the ability to effectively translate and maintain themselves continually in humans, they become also less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS's clinical manifestations reveal the SRAS and are characterized by a evolutive acid pneumonia.
In contrast to SRAS, many patients suffering from MERS have also developed a acue renal deficiency, which is the characteristic of MERS in relation to HCoV pathology.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhee and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2 500 cases confirmed in workshops were reported with a high dead rate, or 34.4%, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most mortal viruses with humans.
A diarrhee is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected in SARS-CoV-2 were reported and could contribute to its rapid propagation in the world.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the six other HCoVs have shown very interesting differences and similarities.
Firstly, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of the COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four Community HCoV (hereinafter HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of infection in SARS-CoV, although the proportion is very lower.
Finally, like the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be decelated in salmon samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, its pathogenicity and its sustainable diffusion, will affect the last destination of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four Community HCOVs caused moderate symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
In other words, both could be the surrounding of HCoV pandemies.
In order to achieve this, HCoVs must be responsible for humans in a sufficient proportion to allow adaptative mutations to compulse the host's limitation factors.
In this optical, more the SARS-CoV-2 persist epidemic and more the number of infected people is important, more there are chances that the virus is totally adapted to humans.
If it is well adjusted, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quarantine or other infection control measures.
Since many years, the four CoVs acquisition in community have been within the population, which makes a simple range in immunocompetitive subjects.
These viruses do not need animal reserves.
However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and expand themselves in their zoonotic reserves and seek a chance to achieve potential hum·s targets, probably through one or more intermediate and enhanced hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 provides similar characteristics as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four Community-acquired HCoV.
However, it is more pathogenic than the HCoV acquis in community and less patogenic than the SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether he will completely adapt to human beings and will be among those last without animal hosts reserved or intermediate.
Before discussing animal origins of the HCoV, we will be well useful to discuss definitions and characteristics of the evolution, natural, reserves, mediators and enlargements of the HCoV.
A animal serves a HCoV-evolutive host if it opens a nearby rise that shares a higher approval at the level of nuclear sequence.
The virus of origin has often been well adapted and is not pathogenic for his host.
Similarly, a host reserves the HCoV continually and long-termly.
However, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservation host.
In particular, since 80% of Guangzhou's market animals have anticorps anti-SARS-CoV, the possibilities that several species of small mammifers can also be used for enlargeable hosts can be excluded.
These cows are positive to the anti-SARS-CoV anticorps and to the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have placed the bases of a new concept, which is the hosts of human pathogens.
The conversion enzyme of an angiotensine hum 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV recipient.
Despite a high authorisation between these two viruses, it is usually considered that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of the SARS-CoV and that the shoes are not the host to reserve SARS-CoV immediately.
That's why the shoes can't be the host of the MERS-CoV intermediate reservation.
Furthermore, studies conducted in the Middle East showed that dromaders were severely anticorps that neutralize MERS-CoV, as the camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
Furthermore, infected camels excrete the virus not only by respiratory ways but also by fecale way, which also constitutes the main way of excretion of the hair-souris.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Moreover, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than the separator of the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 of pangoline.
Recombination is an extensive factor of the development of beta-CoV.
Scientists are still divided into the immediate zonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could both be issued from the Cove-Souris CoV, while the HCoV-OC43 parent viruss and HCoV-HKU1 were found at rounders.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another CoV of chauve-souris, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam 19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelides were also suspicious of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 was broken up the barrier of species to infect humans from home beasts around 1890, an respiratory infection pandemy was reported.
The history of the interspective transmission of HCoV-229E is less.
Alpha-CoV of the nearby HCoV-229E chauve-souris was found.
On the other hand, contrary to the alpagas, men may have a contact with the shoes in a shared neck.
In contrast, people have close contacts with the alpagas.
Then, the alpha-CoVs of the HCoV-229E-souris cow are many and not pathogenic in the cheese, while the alpha-CoV of the Alpaga has caused an respiratory disease epidemic in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in sauvage animals.
In fact, the hair-souris is the direct source of human pathogen virus, including the rage virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that shoes can send HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the Alpha-CoVs of the cow-souris served for genetic reserves of HCoV-229E, the alpagas and dromaders could use intermediate hosts transmitting virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspective transmission of chains to human drugs and dromaders.
The evolutional origin of MERS-CoV found in the shoes is known by its initial identification and has also been strengthened by later discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV is present in the dromaders since decades.
It was well adjusted to these chambers that passed from intermediate hosts to hosts to stay stabil.
In contrast with the role of chambers in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
Several possibilities of interspective transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
Firstly, the shoes may be the host reserved by a virus apparent to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share a →logical nine with shoes through the depth or carbon mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts with which a virus linked to SRAS-CoV-2 was recently introduced.
Humans contract the virus by depthing and consumption of giber meat.
Many mammifers including domestic animals may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that have been together in contact with the shoes and pangolins.
Research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is current.
Compared with other simple ARN viruss, the estimated mutation rate of CoV could be considered as "modified" to "height" with a average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitution per year, › CoV adaptation phase to new hosts.
However, the CoV mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
In relation to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adjustment.
It can be assumed that he has already been adapted to another nearly human host.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV, which was well adjusted to dromaders.
In theory, genetic dilution is low to produce vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 short-term ineffective.
Thirdly, the CoVs change adequately and often a model in the replication of the RNA through a single mechanism of “copy choice”.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found at the same time for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for the CoVs observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and bathCoV-HKU9.
Virus interaction related to transmission
Besides these three viral factors above, the viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor that affects interspective transmission.
The SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive choice evidence during interspective transmission episodes.
In other words, these two replacements of amino acids may be key factors of human adjustment.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell recipient as SARS-CoV.
A difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein S1 means that the affinity of this protein S with the ACE2 hum′ could have been changed.
In fact, a electronic chryomicroscope study indicates a 10-20 times higher than that link than the observed ACE2 hum· and the SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interested in determining whether another co-receptor can be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Externally, HCoV-NL63 is also in the ACE2 but with a different part of the protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sial acid 9-O-acetil for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and HCoV’s natural reserves, such as shoes, dromaders and rongers, could constitute a barrier for interspective transmission.
New Eergence HCoV: return to the outcome box
The diversity of the cow-souris CoV offers many opportunities for new HCoV emergence.
In this sense, the CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoV.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered as important in human adjustment, since the SARS-CoV chain viruss were isolated, but were coded different ORF8 proteins.
This removes ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is pressure as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most of Nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been known to recombination episodes between different lines, which occurred in drugs in Saudi Arabia.
While a ORF4 was able to be observed in the cheap-souris and chamber virus associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple introduction of nucleotide, generating a discharge of the reading frame.
Finally, the development of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their reservation hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when covs were infected by CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and cows.
It seemed to have been well adapted to the CoV of anatomic and physical viewpoint.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the cows reduce effectively the pathology decreased by the CoVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive deficits of oxygen (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of the cow-souris chains could remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "relection" by the exoribonate, which would create a selective pressure and cause highly pathogenic viral socks when they are introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV sockets could also develop by recombination, generating the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adjustment of the host.
So this is not a hazard that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or providing moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as shoes and camels.
They are strongly responsible without providing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic porters and the cause of serious infection cases in humans.
Several symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and cytokine choc; more immune response is strong, more severe pulmonary lesions.
Nevertheless, in the asymptomatic porters, the immune response was removed from the CoV replication.
The same immune response strategy could have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the previous phase of infection in SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.
Moreover, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in the shoes.
According to this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a beta-CoV of cow-souris shared by 95% of nucleotidic genealogy with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a CoV of cow-souris dividing 96% of nuclear hemoglobin with SARS-CoV-2.
Beta-CoV of Pangolin note that similar to SARS-CoV-2 were discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediary hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs were returned under the ramp fires due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV exists in the dromader for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, milk and lake for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as it was done on the markets of safe animals in China to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop MERS recovering epidemies, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in chambers, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to elimise these viruss, new genotypes could cause epidemies.
Many Zonotic CoVs are in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of cow-souris, including the zonotic potential is very high.
Cultural consumption of sauvage animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unusual contacts between human and animals.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is a county opportunity.
Continue monitoring of mammifers is necessary to better understand CoV and their natural hosts, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemies.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent the virus zoonoses is to keep away from the natural zoonoses nine.
Firstly, if a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to pangolins, it would be interested in observering in what circumstances the shoes and pangolins could share the same →logical nine.
Secondly, if the shoes play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how people are in contact with the shoes.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, shoes and pangolins.
That it is a cow-souris, a pangolin or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or nearly identical parents virus observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contradict respiratory diseases such as grippe or rume, for example, by laying hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (c.-d. muckles).
The main medical goal of the hand lavage is of eliminer patogenic agents (bacteria, virus or other micro-equivalents that may cause diseases) and chemical products, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including the reduction of the propagation of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; the prevention of diarrhee infectious causes; the reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as reduction of the infantial mortality rate in household accommodations.
In developing countries, infantile mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhee can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as lavating hands to safe.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality in children less than five years, which makes approximately 1,8 million victims per year.
Inside the diarrhee and pneumonia, every year the death of approximately 3,5 million children leads to death.
The lavage of hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct contact.
Minimum delegate effect, frequency lavage of hands can cover the skin by providing a cut disorder.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that heavy lavage of hands could lead to echema or dermatite at the level of hands, characterised by squamous skin and demangeous, especially frequent in health workers.
The too frequent lavage of hands is also considered one of the symptoms of the compulsional disorder (TOC).
The deparsition twice a year, associated with daily lavage of hands to sane and daily teeth brossing with a fluored dentifrice, is in the heart of this national programme.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of scientists and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solution.
The only water is not an effective cleaning for the skin because the lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the ground, are hardly solved in the water.
The solid snow, due to its reusable nature, can rebuild issues of use.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or recommended desinfectants allows to target antibiotics residents in nature.
Thus, even if the antibiotics resisting sockets are not the fruit of the antibacterian sciences, these may not be as effective as announced.
Besides the tensioactive and skin protection agent, the most complex formulae can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobian function, and other protective agents (ara, vitamins, menthol, extraits of plants).A rigorous analysis from the Oregon University of Health has indicated that the sains were both effective as the antibacterian sains intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate the handholders.
The warm water used to lay hands is not sufficiently cold to kill the dead.
The body temperature (37 °C) increases rapidly.
However, heavy and sweet water is more efficient than cold and sweet water to eliminate the natural oil of salt and water.
However, contrary to popular faith, scientific studies showed that the use of tide water did not contribute to reduce the microbian load on hands.
A desinfect or an antiseptic for hands is a product of hygiene of non-coated hands.
Most of them are formulated based on isopropylic alcohol or ethatha associated with a heating agent such as the carbon (acrylic acid polymer) for → a gel, or a humeting such as glycerin to make a liquid or mouse for a greater use facility and reduce the effect of alcohol.
Diluated hydrogen peroxide strengthens the antimicrobian activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% of alcohol eliminate the germes effectively.
Hydroalcool solutions kill the steriles, multiresistent Property (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (such as HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, grippe and hepatitis) and champion.
Hydroalcool solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of counterfeit gastroenterity.A sufficient quantity of deinfecting for hands or hydroalcool solution must be used for good form or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their use facility and rapid elimination activity of micro-equipments; however, they should not replace a suitable lavage of hands unless you have water and sugar.
Frequent use of hydroalcool solutions may result in cut disorder if the formula is not strengthened by emulsions and/or hydrating agents of the skin.
The effects of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by embracing glucerine and/or other emulators in the formula.
In the context of clinical tests, hydroalcool solutions containing emulsions have caused just less irritation and cut sugar than antimicrobian sains or detergents.
The allergic contact dermatite, contact or hyper-equity or additives presented in hydro-alcool solutions are rare.
Despite their efficiency, non-hide products eliminate not the organic materials presented on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why the disinfectants for hands are not as effective as the science and water to avoid propagation of many patogenic agents, since these last ones remain on their hands.
The efficiency of deinfectants for non-alcool hands depends strongly on ingredients and formula, and has always been clearly lower than the alcohol and alcohol-based deficiencies.
Recently, the formulaes used by benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobian activity after application, in the difference of alcohol, which is achieved after repeated use, probably due to progressive cutanated adverse reactions.
Centry or the earth can be more effective than the only water, but less than it knows.
Moreover, if the earth or the cemetery is contaminated by microemes, it can increase the propagation of diseases instead of breathing it.
Inside the shadow, the census is also a deinfecting agent because, in contact with water, it forms a alcaline solution.
WHO recommends the censure or the sand as alternative to the sun when it is not available.
I have hands with courant water thick or cold.
The water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnating water points, while the water temperature does not make differences.
Make a generous quantity of sain on the hands by striking them against the other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the angles.
The sun removes the skin wings, and studies show that people have the tendency to lay their hands more carefully when they use sane than with the only water.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action to frotter growing fraction, which helps to eliminate the skin wheels, and to flourish longer from the wheat.
Rain too much to the courant water.
Renaming in a stagnating water bassin can lead to the reanimation of hands.
Sleep with a clean or free air.
The most often forgotten areas are the puzzle, the pointing, the spaces between the fingers and the beaches.
The artificial sheets and the vernis on the e.g. can have microequivalents.
A hydrated lotion is often recommended to avoid having sucking hands; the skin sugar promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash the hands when the water of the robet and/or the safe is not available. For example, to cool water from a bidon or a wooden and/or to use the cender if needed, in developing countries.In the situations where water supply is limited (as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economy water, such as "typepy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple hold that uses a suspended cross using a ring, and a pedal that allows a small quantity of water on hands and a sain bread.
Effective shutting of hands is a key part of the hygiene process of hands, but the best way to shut up hands in the toilet is discussed.
More research suggests that paper-services are much more hygiene than electric sugars than they are often located in the toilet.
Following the lavage and shutting of hands at warm air tomorrow, it was shown that the total number of tissues increased in average of 194 % on the finger pulp and 254 % on the powder.
The sugar seed in the morning was a average increase in the total number of tears on the powder of 42 % and 15 % powder.
After hand shutting, the following variations were observed:
There are many different sugar manufacturers, and the sugars have been compared to sealing with paper seeds.
The lavage of hands with disinfectable tabs is a alternative solution during movements, in the absorption of safe and water.
Hydroalcool solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when the hospital staff forgets to lay hands.
The medical lavage of the hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generic quantity of sweet and water or gel to mouse and break each part of the hands.
The hands must be stripped against the other by binding between the fingers.
After sucking, the paper seed must be used to close the robet (and open the output door if appropriate).
The objective of lavaging hands in health structures is to remove the pathogenic microems (hermes) and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before a aseptic gesture; and
All the birds must be removed.
In the framework of this procedure, hands and pre-brases are needed to be laid up to coal, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During the rice, the water on the pre-brases is not running up to the hands.
In order to reduce the propagation of germes, it is preferred to lay hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after being occupied with a sick person.
With regard to the monitoring of staphylococ infections in hospitals, the main benefits of hand-laving were obtained in the first 20% of the lavage, and there were only little additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand-lavage above 35%.
More research is needed to discover the most effective interventions in various health structures.
For example, in the major part of rural Africa, it is rare to find robots to lay hands close to private or private toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand lavage stations.
However, the low lavage rates of hands may also be imputable to tennis habits, rather than to a lack of sain or water.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand lavage stations can be included in the hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce infantile diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Lavage of Hands is another example of the campaign to promote the development of the behavior.Soon the coronavirus pandemy of 2019-2020, the CEF encouraged the adoption of an emosion that illustrates the lavage of hands.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of the lavage of hands to safe is just more rentable than other interventions in the field of water and asylum.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were two of the fetides called mixed.
For example, in Germany, the “good hand lavage techniques ” were placed at the neighbourhoods and in the toilets of offices and airports.
The expression "laughing their hands" refers to a person to assume the responsibility or to be complicated of something.
Furthermore, those who are authorised to lay their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclinated to give themselves to other compensatory measures of purification, such as the benefit.
Similarly, the hindouism, the buddhism, the sikhism, the Jewishism and the Islam requires to lay hands before and after each food.

'Cause it's the grippe season.
It should also be highlighted that the artificial selection can contribute to involving virus genemens, which are very probably following pressures under the selection, especially by the host's immune system.
For example, the total ORF4 loss can be cited in the HCoV-229E prototype socket due to a delegation of two nuclears.
While a ORF4 was able to be observed in the cheap-souris and chamber virus associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple introduction of nucleotide, generating a discharge of the reading frame.
Finally, the development of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their reservation hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when covs were infected by CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and cows.
It seemed to have been well adapted to the CoV of anatomic and physical viewpoint.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the cows reduce effectively the pathology decreased by the CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of natural murder cells in the cows is removed by the positive regulation of the recipient inhibiting natural murder cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of moleculars of the higher complex of histocompatibility of class I.
In addition, the high level of reactive deficits of oxygen (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of the cow-souris chains could remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "relection" by the exoribonate, which would create a selective pressure and cause highly pathogenic viral socks when they are introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV sockets could also develop by recombination, generating the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adjustment of the host.
So this is not a hazard that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or providing moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as shoes and camels.
They are strongly responsible without providing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic porters and the cause of serious infection cases in humans.
Several symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and cytokine choc; more immune response is strong, more severe pulmonary lesions.
Nevertheless, in the asymptomatic porters, the immune response was removed from the CoV replication.
The same immune response strategy could have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to the interferon is especially strong in the shoes.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the previous phase of infection in SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.
Moreover, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is defective in the shoes.
According to this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared in accordance with the general scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were issued.
While a beta-CoV of cow-souris shared by 95% of nucleotidic genealogy with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a CoV of cow-souris dividing 96% of nuclear hemoglobin with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present on the markets were discovered as identical virus porters in SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Beta-CoV of Pangolin note that similar to SARS-CoV-2 were discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediary hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there exists questions, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 has been designed by humans, either voluntaryly or accidentally.
CoVs were returned under the ramp fires due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in the cheaps and other animals has strengthened our understanding of the role playing by zoonotic origins and animal reserves in the transmission of HCoV to humans.
Many facts have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from the cow and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Since the infection in the SARS-CoV is from the contact between humans and markets, the closure of fresh products markets and the deterioration of civets that are there would have been possible to end effectively with the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the cost markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the covering of many beta-CoV beta lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question is to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammifers and, where appropriate, how this transmission is going to happen, remains to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV exists in the dromader for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, milk and lake for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as it was done on the markets of safe animals in China to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop MERS recovering epidemies, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in chambers, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to elimise these viruss, new genotypes could cause epidemies.
Many Zonotic CoVs are in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of cow-souris, including the zonotic potential is very high.
The opportunities are not lacking that these zoonotic CoVs develop and recombin, providing the emergency of new CoV more transmissible and/or mortal in the future.
Cultural consumption of sauvage animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unusual contacts between human and animals.
In view of the ravage caused by the SRAS, MERS and the COVID-19, it should be implemented a better preparation and intervention plan.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is a county opportunity.
Although the shoes have many characteristics favorable to the virus diffusion, the probability for man to be in contact with the shoes and other salvage species can be minimised if people are able to keep themselves at the need.
Continue monitoring of mammifers is necessary to better understand CoV and their natural hosts, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemies.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent the virus zoonoses is to keep away from the natural zoonoses nine.
All secrets of the Zonotic origin of SRAS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
Firstly, if a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to pangolins, it would be interested in observering in what circumstances the shoes and pangolins could share the same →logical nine.
Secondly, if the shoes play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how people are in contact with the shoes.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, shoes and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammifers, including domestic animals, are able to contract SARS-CoV-2, it should be processed simultaneously with monitoring and experimental contamination.
That it is a cow-souris, a pangolin or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or nearly identical parents virus observed in their natural hosts.
The future research in this area will enable the evolutional trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 to animals and will have important effects on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Require a update of the criteria of the "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team made a quick recommendation Directive for coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) and described our experience and provided references to combating this pandemy at the world level.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge gradually progress on the results of the current studies and the experience of the clinical practice; therefore, the strategy for the treatment and treatment are also continually updated.
In this court, we answered a comment on our directives and provided the most recent criteria for a "supported case" and a "confirmed case" of the last directives on the COVID-19 (seventh version) of the National Committee on the Health of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a epidemic that now officially carries the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called a severe acid respiratory syndrome to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified the COVID-19 of Pandemy.
To be able to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team set a rapid recommendation on military research on 06 February 2020.
She took much attention since she was published.
However, it is necessary to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progressively based on the results of the current studies and the experience of the clinical practice; therefore, the strategies for the treatment and treatment are also continually updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Directives of the National Committee on the Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) reported seven issues from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, with some contexts substantially.
Our directive has received a comment from Zhou and al., these recently presented a simple proposal for evaluation based on their clinical experience.
Their travels have made new evidence for our Directive and are also a valuable reference to this global pandemy.
We approve their important work and thank them.
However, their work should also be updated in the last COVID-19 Directives (test seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspicious case must associate one of the characteristics of the epidemiological anticipations with two clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations without epidemiological anticipations:
epidemiological anticipations: (1) an anticipation of traveling or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days before the presentation of symptoms; (2) an anticipation of contact with infective cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acids) ; (3) an anticipation of contact with patients presenting fibre or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan or of neighbors or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported during the last 14 days before the presentation of symptoms; (4) an anticipation of contact with the contact with a closely confirmed closing, as well as the 2-housing area, and the 2-secondation.
Clinical indications: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) images presenting the characteristics of an infection in the COVID-19; (3) total numbering of white globules indicating a normal, reduced or reduced number of limfocytes from the beginning of the symptoms.
The confirmed case must be supported on the subject with any of the following pathological or serological evidence elements: (1) PCR test in real time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the viral genocide with a strong homogeneity with new coronavirus with ; (3) positive serological test for anticorps IgM and IgG of SARS-CoV-2; or modifying the IgG specific anticorps of SARS-CoV-2 with a positive negative or increase of the title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase in relation to the Aigus Phase.
We can find that the PCR test of nuclear acids in real times in respiratory ways or in blood prefects has been ated in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic depistage of blood precepts was held at the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the serological evidence was given at the seventh edition.
These changes are supported by the continuous work of researchers aiming to find an optimal kit for the detection of nuclear acids for a quickly-speak, as well as the samples of respiratory paths including blood prefect, with a increased ability of different specifics, and contributed to the positive result of the specific anticorps in the confirmed criteria.
Moreover, more evidence reminds us of the density of atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphical representation of Zhou and al. should be updated because they classified people who have no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence is energetized and we ask the readers to submit their comments.
As regards the "supported cases" and "confirmed cases, we suggest them to follow and comply with the most recent directives in their country.
Our team will also update our Directive in time to offer its aid.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a journalist
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 on one day.
The country thus records a record of mortality due to virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangemis Institute of epidemiology, supervision of diseases and research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of infected persons registered included 114 active cases and 33 health careers, who remained limited to home.
A total of 17 deaths was recorded.
The closure of public transports began on 26 March and had to end on Sunday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medicin, fuel and food) was always authorised.
On 19 March, these three people had already been restored.
Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exceeded the million in the world, according to the data of the University of Johns Hopkins.
All around the world, the countries have announced stronger measures to prevent the propagation of disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Master of Moscou, extended the town's limitation until 1 May.
The Portuguese Parliament voted on the prolongation of the state of 15 days of national emergency; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and a vote against.
Zonotic origins of human coronavirus
Severe respiratory syndrome epidemies (SRAS) and respiratory syndrome of the Middle-Orient (MERS) have inverted the trend to demonstrate how devastatant and potentially mortal HCoV infection could be.
Most of the HCoVs come from cow-souris to which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate hosts of some HCoV are also with.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications in preventing human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also allow better understanding the CoV in humans.
According to the differences in protein sequences, the CoVs are classified in four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, ↑-CoV and delta-CoV). The type of Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoV and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence showed that the shoes and rongers play the genetic source role for the majority of Alpha-CoV and Beta-CoV, while birds are the main reserve of CoV and delta-CoV.
Today, seven human CoVs (HCoV) are with.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the respiratory syndrome of the Middle-Orient (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracking of HCoV's zoonotic origins provides a framework to understand the natural history, motor forces and restrictive factors of the franching of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search of the host(s) reserve, intermediate and enhanced SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future accounts.
Animal CoVs have been withed since the end of the 1930s.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs were identified.
HCoV-229E's first suck was isolated in the respiratory paths of patients with a higher respiratory infection in 1966, and then adjusted to increase in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected by HCoV-229E had symptoms of the classic rhume, including headwoods, extremities, diseases and fats, with fever and toughs observed in 10 to 20% of the cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present worldwide and are mainly transferred in winter in tempered climate countries.
Storage storages reduce the limits of toilet paper per purchase
Saturday and Saturday night, the ships of Australian magazines Woollts and Coles reduced their toilet paper buying restrictions to two and a package by purchasing in all the magazines at the national scale respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits were displayed as a form of messages to boxes and on Facebook pages of strings.
Buyers appeared to have reserves by fear of the COVID-19 and the need to be limited.
Mercedy, Wool ́ths also restricted toilet paper purchases for home deliveries to a package by command.
These measures have resulted in the significant limitation of four packages by purchasing introduced by Wool¤ths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his pressure of 8 March, stated that with the restriction of four current packages, “much storages are still in stock broken in the hour after delivery” and qualified the request for “unexpected” while ALDI, in a Tuesday Facebook publication, qualified “inexpected”.
The wines have known a "super growth" last week, according to a Wool’s portfolio.
The Costco magazine in Canberra also restricted the amount allowed to two packages last week.
In order to reduce the penalty, Coles commanded greater packages with the suppliers and increased the delivery frequency, Wool
Zimmerman, the Executive Director of the Australian Association of Detectives, stated that the detailers are trying to increase stocks, but that the restrictions of the local Council on the time of carrier delivery make the task difficult.
It provides an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to respond to the request and less promotions.
Thursday, ALDI announced that, after the anticipated discovery of stocks, some magazines are not able to honor the promotion of Thursday.
In a article on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, expert of the University of Queensland's distribution sector, explained that the magazines reassuring stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a voluminous article, which causes stocks of a reduced quantity that, once exhausted, leaves large empty spaces in rayons, strengthening the impression of a penure.
“ Coles and Wool ́ths consider that if rayons are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and deinfectants can be [build] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce the panic, ” explained Zimmerman in ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap stated last Thursday they were in stock rupture.
Kimberly-Clark, manufacturing the Kleenex Toilet paper, and Solaris Paper manufacturing the paper Sorbent, highlighted that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, pointed out that some soldiers of immobile goods offered free toilet paper to the first employer during business in Melbourne, while less wins were organized by the fact that the buyers were in conjunction during the long weekend of the work party.
The Sunday edit of NT News, a day printed in Darwin, included an eight-page envelope to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
The magazines were able to impose restrictions, a report on 3 March of the ABC, where they announced that they were not intended to introduce purchase restrictions.
Zimmerman also said that other products knew a strong request, including masks, desinfectants, seed products, hygiene products for hands and fat.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday evening that the British supermarket Ocado limited the toilet paper purchases of Andres to two packets of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization qualifies the COVID-19 of Pandemy
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) qualified the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) pandemy.
Although the word "pandemy" is only referring to the rate of illness propagation, not to the dangerousness of specific cases, the WHO indicated the need to move governments to action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemy.
If countries devise, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilise their population in the context of the answer, “Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.
"We are strongly concerned, not only by the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Peace, the former Director of the United States Centres for the Control and Prevention of the diseases, the pandemy is "without power".
He stated, in the proposals proposed by CNN in Fev, that “apart from the grippe, no other respiratory virus has been observed from its appearance to its continuous propagation at the world scale. ”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, explaining that “We have never been witnesses of a pandemy caused by a coronavirus. ”
What he said, "and we have never been witnesses of a pandemy that can be managed at the same time."
The new pandemy status follows the WHO decision, in January, to declare epidemia a international health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infections of the United States, said to the epidemic: "To make short, the situation will be empire."
Thursday, Press announced that there were at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, which led over 4 600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemy of 2019-20 is a coronavirus disease epidemic current since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acid respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, stated international health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemy on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 1,61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territory, which included approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364 000 people are healthy.
The letality rate is estimated by 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13,04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Corrent symptoms include fibre, tough, and exhaust.
Complications may include the pneumonia and the acid respiratory disorder syndrome.
The time between the exposure and the appearance of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it can cook between two and forty days.
There is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment.
The main treatment is a symptomatic and supporting therapy. Recommended preventive measures comprise the laying of hands, covering the mouth to allerge, remaining remote from other people, and monitoring and confiscating those suspicious of being infected.
The world's authorities have reacted by setting restrictions on movements, quarters, coverages, risk controls on jobs and institutions closed.
Pandemy has generated serious socioeconomic pollutions at the world level, report or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generalized penalties aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, which have approximately affected 99.4 percent of the world student population.
False information on the virus has been reported on the Internet, and xenophobia and discrimination incidents have occurred to China, other Asian origin and appearance persons in East and South East, as well as to other people coming from regions in many cases of the virus.
As a result of the decreasing travel and fermentation in the heat industry, there was a reduction in the atmosphere pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a home of unknown cause pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an application was opened on January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the market of big fruit of the Sea of Huan, and thus the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic was SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered and closely linked to the coronavirus of the cow-souris, the coronavirus of the pangolins, and the SARS-CoV. Then, it was found that the first known person who presented symptoms was sick on 1 December 2019, and that person had no manifest link to the later home of the fresh products market.
In the case of the first home reported in December 2019, both thirds had been linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an uncertain report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be remonted to 17 November 2019, with a 55-year-old person from the province of Hubei. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases seemed to decrease in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong sub-estimation of cases, especially those who have well-being symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among youths, 19 years old and less than 2,4% of the cases in the world. The scientific adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population had to be infected before they could reach an effective collective immunity.
The cases indicate the number of persons tested at the COVID-19, whose test was confirmed positively by the official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies to not test those who had only blessed symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
On March 16, a study showed that until 23 January, China estimated 86% of COVID-19 non-detected infections, and that these unregistred infections were the source of 79% of documented cases of infection.
A statistical analysis on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the cases reported.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of the COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study conducted by the United States Control and Prevention Centres concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people reached by COVID-19 are healthy.
For those who do not cure, the time between the appearance of symptoms and the death is between 6 and 41 days, the most covering of 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, 97,000 deaths were imposed to the COVID-19.
In China, at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of the deaths concerned over 60 years, and 75 per cent would suffer pre-exhibitive health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official decrees related to the COVID-19 pandemy are generally referenced to those who have been tested positively to the COVID.
The number of real victims of the COVID-19 could be much higher, since it could not include non-tested persons - such as home, home homes, home homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the overmortality numbers during the pandemy are 4-5 times higher than the official decount of the COVID dead.
A portfolio of the Centres for Control and Prevention of United States diseases (CDC) has recognized “We know that [the number of announced deaths] is under-estimated”, a statement confirmed by anecdotic reports of the sub-valuation in the United States. Such sub-estimation is often occurred during pandemies, such as the H1N1 grippe epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside the continental China occurred in the Philippines on the 1st February, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside the continental China, more than twelve deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths on all continents other than the Antarctic continents. Several indicators are covered to quantify mortality.
These figures are different from the regions and with time, and are affected by the volume of tests, quality of health system, therapeutic options, the time exposed from the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-d’estic report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases for a given period.
According to the statistics of the University of Johns-Hopkins, the worldwide case report is 6,0% (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the case-dèes report decreased from 17,3% (for the symptoms shown between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for the symptoms shown after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the letality rates (letality rates), which represent the percentage of persons covering a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rates), which represent the percentage of contaminated (diagnosed and unexpected) that coincide with a disease.
These statistics are not limited at the time and follow a particular population of contamination in the course of the disease.
Many scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford considers that the infection rate for pandemy in its globality is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this puzzle is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on the estimates of letality.
WHO supports that pandemy can be controlled.
The pipe and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and can vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the Pennsylvania State University stated: "No control, generally infectional epidemies are stabilised and then starts to recover when the disease is missing hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant previsions at the moment when it will happen. ”
The medical adviser of the Chinese Government Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed from June" if all countries were to be mobilised to follow WHO's recommendations on the measures to endanger virus propagation.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London High School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will continue, possibly for a year or two”.
According to a study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, a distance and other measures will be necessary “ until a vaccine is available (once may be 18 months or more)”.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus -- because it is very easily translated—developed completely" and that he could "be transformed into a seasonary disease, likely to reveal each year".
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the width of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes not specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most core symptoms are fever (88 %) and sugar tox (68 %).
Corrupting symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosity), loss of odorate, slowness, muscle and articulary pains, grass pain, chephalees, freshness, vomiting, emotion, diarrhee, or cyanose. WHO states that about one person of six is seriously sick and has respiratory difficulties.
Centers for the control and prevention of the United States diseases (CDC) recognise the symptoms of emergency such as respiratory difficulty, pain or persistent toracic pressure, sudden confusion, difficult reveals, and face or blue lips; immediately medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The later development of the disease can cause a serious pneumonia, a severe respiratory syndrome, a sequence, a sectical choc and death.
Some infected persons may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with results in test confirming infection, so researchers issued recommendations; those who had a contact with confirmed persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
The Chinese asymptomatic assessments varie from some to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between contamination and the appearance of symptoms) is ascilled between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of COVID-19 persons who lost the odorate was initially 30 % before falling to 15 %.
Certain information on how the disease is spread remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly in a repeated contact and by fines of gouttelets produced by alls, extinction, or speaking; this repeated contact corresponds to a range of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies revealed that no protection can design goutlets at a distance of 4,5 meters (15 feet) to 8,2 feet (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transferred by guittellet fingers that would remain in air for longer periods, which could be designed by speaking. The respiratory goutlets can also be designed at the expiration, especially by speaking, even though the virus is usually not airported.
Poultry can be attached into the mouth or nose of other persons at the side or even inhaled in the powder.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intrusion and reanimation (RCP) can cause respiratory secretions that are pulverized and thus lead to air propagation.
It can also spread when someone touchs a contaminated surface, especially the skin, before he touches his eyes, his nose, or his mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted by the sales, this risk is considered as weak.
The Chinese Government excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the beginning of the symptoms, however, the propagation can be possible before the symptoms appear and at the progressive stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive to disease until three days before the symptoms occurring, suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few signatures of asymptomatic cases confirmed in work, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) states that if we do not know exactly with the easierness of the disease, a person who is generally combined with two to three others.
Exactly, the virus could be detected at the end of three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable acid 304, after one day on the carton, and at the end of four hours on the cover.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Home animals and other animals have been tested positive to the COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, the British authorities recommend to lay their hands after touching animals, as after they have been in contact with other surfaces than infected people could have touched.
Severe respiratory acid syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three persons with pneumonia associated with Wuhan’s age respiratory disease home.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronavirus appearing in the nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the summer, which dissolve its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis showed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the type Betacoronavirus, Sarbecovirus (line B) sub-gene, associated with two sugar-souris issues.
It is similar to 96% of the genealogy of another coronavirus coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one friendly difference acid in some parts of the geno-sequences between pangolin viruses and humans.
The comparison of the ennome has at this day shown a maximum of 92% of the common genetic material between the coronavirus of pangolins and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Infection by the virus may be temporarily established on the basis of symptoms, however the final confirmation is effected by inverse transcription of the reaction in polymerase (rRT-PCR) of infected or scanner secretions.
A study comparing the PCR and scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is just more sensitive than the PCR, even less precisely, because many of its image functions are co-consistent with other pathological pneumonies and processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “the scanner is not used to describe or as a test of first intention for the COVID-19”.
The WHO has performed several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first submission on 17 January.
The test uses the inverse transcription of the reaction by polymerase in real time (RRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood prefects.
The results are usually available in a few hours or days.
This test is generally performed on a prufficient of rhinopharynx but it can also be used for a gorgeo. Many workshops and companies currently develop serological tests, which detect anticorps.
On 6 April 2020, no of them revealed sufficiently reliable to be approved for a generalized use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for an emergency use by only certificate workers.
The characteristic image elements on radiographics and tomodensitometers (scanner) of people presenting symptoms include the opacity of asymetrical device depths and an absent of pleural expansion.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently a international online database of confirmed case image results.
Because of recovery with other infections such as adenovirus, the image without confirmation by PCR is limited to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of the thoracic scanners with the PCR and showed that if the image is less precise for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, predicting it as a depistage tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutive neurones networks based on artificial intellectuality have been developed to detect virus characteristics in the image both on radiographics and scanners.
Strategy for the prevention of the transmission of the disease includes globally a good personal hygiene, laying hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with non-slaved hands, and cutting or out in a mouth and casting the mouth directly into a powder.
It was recommended to those who had already been contaminated to bring a chirurgical mask in public.
Distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. A number of governments have prohibited or disabled all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus reached the stage of the Community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spread in the communities, and some members of these communities don't know where or how they have been contaminated. It is advised to health professionals who care for someone who could be infected to take normal precautions and contact cares, and to carry out protective lunettes. The research of contacts is a important method that health authorities can determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of localization data by governments in this regard raised confidentiality problems with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for limits to this type of monitoring.
Various mobile applications were made or proposed on the basis of the voluntary, and from 7 April 2020, more than one twelve expert groups worked on respecting private life solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of a user in close to other portable phones.
The users then receive a message if they have been contacted with someone who has been tested positively at the COVID-19. False ideas are currently on how to prevent infection; for example, the nose and loading with the mouth bag is not effective.
There is no vaccine against the COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to lay hands to prevent the propagation of disease.
The CDC recommends people to lay their hands often in the sun and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they were at the toilet or when the hands are wedding salted; before eating; and after being mocked, shot, or extinct.
It's because the virus is destroyed outside the human body by his own family, who breaks his protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended to use a deinfect for alcohol-based hands containing a volume of at least 60 % of alcohol when safe and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unlawn hands.
The surfaces may be discontinued in several ways (in a minute of exposure to an inoxidable acid surface), including 62-71 % and isopropanol 50-100 %, natrium hypochloride to 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide to 0,5 % and iodic povidone at 0,2-7,5 %.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate of chlorhexidine are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a establishment as an immobile office or a crochet, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, and common electronic equipment such as tablets, tactiles, keyboards, telecommands, and automatic distributors used by sick people, they be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and their nose with their stuck cool or a mosque when they are all or extinct, and to cut off all the mouths immediately.
The chirurgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because the mask can limit the volume and distance of the designed polls by speaking, outstanding, and alls.
WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at the University of Leeds, “Bringing a mask can reduce the prominence of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without good hygiene of hands. ” The use of masks was also preconceived to those who care for a person who is potentially affected by the disease.
The WHO recommended the mask port for good health people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they take care of a disease reached by the COVID-19, even if it recognises that the mask port can help people not touch the face.
Many countries began to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medicin masks in tissue. China has specifically recommended the use of farming masks for good health people, especially in case of closeness (1 meters (3 feet) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends to carry a chirurgical mask in public transports or bonded locations.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to manufacture face masks and clean them every day.
Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited public outcomes without mask or other ways to cover his nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the port of the mask to everyone in the public places, so that everyone protects himself and protects others.
The Austrian Government ordered that everyone who enters a supermarket takes a mask.
Israel asked all his residents to bring a mask in public.
Thaiwan, who produced ten million masks per day since mid-march, imposed the port of the mask to train passengers and bus interurban on 1 April.
Panama has made the port of a mask for any output, while recommending the manufacture of a artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also largely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (a.k.a. distance) includes measures to control infections aimed at extending the propagation of disease by reducing contacts between persons.
The methods include road restrictions and closure of schools, jobs, stages, theatres and commercial centres.
Social distance methods can be applied, limiting their travels, avoiding the people, saluting without contact and maintaining a distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distance in the regions affected by epidemic.
The maximum width of races recommended by the Governing and Health Agencies of the United States was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of the COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public rashing of more than two persons. The elderly adults and those affecting health problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weak immune system know a increased risk of serious disease and complications, thus they were invited by the CDC to stay in the house as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organisms began to replace the term "social distance" by "distance" to clarify the objective of reduced contacts by preserving social links, whether or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term "social distance" was to believe that it was necessary for a total social isolation, rather than to encourage people to keep contact with others by means of other means.
They understand the recommendation to have sexual reports only with a person with whom we live, who does not have the virus or does not present the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for the positive persons in the COVID-19 and those who think to be infected.
Health Agencies have issued detailed instructions for a correct isolation, and many governments have introduced or recommended the implementation of individuals for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The most strict individual instructions were given to persons in the most risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a disease reached by COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to sit for 14 days from the time they could be exposed for the last time.
Epidemia control strategy is adjustment or elimination, and attainment.
The adjustment is placed in the first phases of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people and to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the propagation of disease to the rest of the population.
When it is impossible to prevent the propagation of disease, efforts turn to the attainment phase: measures are taken to extend this propagation and to reduce its effects on the health care system and society.
Assessment and attainment may be taken at the same time.
The elimination of the extreme measures needed to influence the pandemy by reducing the number of basic reproduction less than 1. A part of the management of an infectional disease epidemic is to try to attain the epidemic little: this is what it is called to adjust the epidemic corbe.
This allows to reduce the risk of surcharge of health services and to gain time for vaccines and treatment development.
Without the non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage epidemic include personal prevention measures such as the hygiene of the hands, the mask port and the individual quarter; social distance measures such as closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; environmental actions such as cleaning of surfaces. More drastic measures aimed at jugling the epidemic have been taken in China since the gravity of this has become apparent, such as the introduction of fourteen cities and a strict prohibition of traveling.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures to limit virus propagation.
South Korea introduced the mass depth and the posts in quarantine location, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected persons who have been engaged in quaranta, and has infringed harmful threats to those who did not.
Thaiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accommodation of medical supplies. Simulations for the Great Britain and the United States show that the attainment (reduction but not elimination of epidemic propagation) and the elimination (reverse epidemic development) faces important challenges.
Optical attainment policies can reduce health care request of 2/3 and half deaths, but can not avoid hundreds of thousands of dead, and health care systems are subjected.
The elimination may be privileged, but it must be continued as long as the virus is in the population hum· (or until a vaccine is available, if it happens first), because, in the contrary, the transmission is quickly reduced during the release of measures.
The long-term intervention to eliminate pandemy has a social and economic cost.
There are no antiviral treatments approved for the COVID-19, but developing efforts are current, including existing treatment tests.
The use of medicines without order against river or drink consumption, as well as rest can contribute to delaying symptoms.
According to gravity, oxygenotherapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can increase the results.
Several components already approved for treatment of other viral diseases are currently in the study for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal medicines" can add the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The ability and adaptation of health care for the needs of COVID-19 is described by WHO as a measure of response to epidemic.
The ECDC and the Regional Office of the WHO for Europe have made direct lines to the attention of hospitals and primary health care services to re-use resources at different levels, in particular by providing working services to the COVID-19 tests, cancelling non-necessary interventions, where possible, separating and isoling the patients tested at the COVID-19, and strengthening the intensive care capacity by training and exercising the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories about the place of origin of the first case (called no patient).
The first case known by the new coronavirus could return to Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China on 1 December 2019.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
They are generally linked to the market of big fruit of the sea of Huan, which also sold live animals. According to a theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. A unknown cause pneumonia house was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital of the province of Hubei, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors of the Central Hospital of Wuhan warned their "coronavirus similar to SRAS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reproved by the police for propagating false voices, and another, Ai Fen, was reproved by his superiors for giving the warning.
The municipal health Commission of Wuhan then made a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of an unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan's health authorities to initiate an early January investigation. In the first phases of the epidemic, the number of cases was doubled about every seven days and half.
At the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus was spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by the New Year of China and the fact that Wuhan is a transport pool and a major railway compatibility.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases on one day, including two people in Pekin and one in Shenzhen.
The later official data show that 6 174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On 26 March, the United States had exceeded China and Italy by showing the greatest number of cases confirmed in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported in the world; more than 97,000 people were dead and more than 364,000 were healed.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemy in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted movements and controlled borders.
The national reactions included adjustment measures such as the provisions in quarantone (as referred to in order to stay at home, open or confinement) and cover them. On April 2, approximately 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subjected to the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1,7 billion people in the world knew a form of confiscation, a number of 2,6 billion days later — about one third of the world population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; a non-certained report suggests that the first case would return to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown pneumonia case home on 26 December, which informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic tests of patients tests on 27 December 2019 indicate the presence of a coronavirus similar to SRAS.
A public opinion was issued on 31 December by the municipal health Commission of Wuhan.
The WHO was informed on the same day.

Actions have again fallen because of fears related to coronavirus, the most important decrease was found on 16 March.
Many believe that economic resistance is low.
Economyist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures made in time by the central banks and states.
The central banks react faster than they did in 2008's finance.
Tourism is one of the most touched sectors because of movement prohibitions, closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against every travel worldwide.
So many aircraft companies have cancelled flights due to a decrease of the request, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British Airlines Flybe has failed.
The impact on the cross-sector has ever reached a level before.
More holidays and iron ports have also been closed.
The epidemic was associated with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the New Chinese Year.
A number of events included important crowds have been canceled by national and regional governments, including the annual festivals of the New Year, and private enterprises have also closed their magazines and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Monday Year have been canceled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass racing, including the Prohibition of Pekin and the traditional temple's flights.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the vacances of the New Year to 10 February, providing the majority of workplaces to not open before that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country’s BDP and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong has passed at its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has stated an emergency situation, stopped schools until March and cancelled its festivals of the New Year. The distribution sector has been affected at the world level, with reductions of the opening of stores or temporary closures.
The visits to trade in Europe and Latin America have fallen from 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, trademen found a decrease of 50 to 60%.
This also caused a loss of 33 to 43 % of petroleum employment in the trade centres in March compared to fev.
Operators of the whole world's trade centres have introduced additional measures, such as cleaning frequency, the installation of thermical scanners to control customers' temperature and cancellation of events. According to an estimation of the United Nations Economy Commission for Latin America, the recession resulted by the Pandemie could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in Latin America in terms of extreme poverty.
In January and February 2020, while the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their job.
In China, a large part of about 300 million rural migratory workers had been blocked with them in domestic or coincidence provinces in Hubei provinces. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their employment and requested aid to the Government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million employment in the United States and the rate of unemployment could reach 32%, ­ the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India left tens of millions of migrating workers in India (receiving a journalary salary) in the labour. The Institute Reid requested that 44% of Canadian employees had a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900 000 employees lost their job in Spain since the mid-mart 2020 confinement.
In the second half of March, 4 million French employees have made a request for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers have made a request for universal credit. Nearly a half million German businesses have put their salaries to a partial activity device undertaken by the Government called Kurzwork.
France and Great Britain adopted the German compensation device for part-time work.
The spectacle and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by pandemy, affecting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both salaried and independent, at the world level.
The organizations of the art and culture sector have tried to maintain their mission (so financed by the State) to provide access to the cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the security of their employees and public and to support artists as possible.
In March 2020, in the world and in different degrees, museums, libraries, spectacle rooms and other cultural institutions have been closed until the new order and their exposures, events and reported representations.
In response, intense efforts have been developed to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerated consequences of disease, cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other social events, such as music and concert festivals, conferences and mode defilements.
The cinema industry also discovered an interruption. The Vatican announced that the Clebrations of the Sanctuary Seme in Rome, which occurred last week of the Christian penitence period of Carema, were canceled.
Many dioxes recommended the elderly Christians to stay with them instead of assisting the midst of Sunday; some churches distribute their religious services to the radio, online, directly or television, while others suggest to practice their worship in “drive-in”.
In the way of the Roman Catholic Diocese, who closed his churches and his heads and the place of Saint-Pierre, who was empty from all his Christian persians, other religious institutions also cancelled their services and limited public races in churches, mosquees, temples, and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iranian announced the cancellation of the prayers of Friday in the areas touched by the epidemic and the holy places were closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the introduction of foreign pearls and its residents in the holy sites of La Mecque and Medina.
Pandemy has caused the most important interruption of the world's sports calendary since the Second World War.
The most important sports events have been reported, including the EUFA 2019-20 campions Ligue, the English football Championnat 2019-20, the EUFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 and the LNH 2019-20 session.
The epidemic has disturbed the Olympical Games Organization of 2020, which initially begins the end of July; the Olympical International Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replaned beyond 2020, but later to the east 2021". The casinos and other world game institutions have been closed and the live poker tournaments have been canceled.
This has moved many players to log in online, and many online games have found a significant increase in their number of new records. The spectacle world has also been touched, with several music groups who have suspended or cancelled their concert turns.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, have also interrupted all their representations.
Some artists have searched for ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in replacement of traditional direct representations, such as online and online concerts or online "festivals" to make, distribute and promote their work.
Online, many Internet teams on the theme of the coronavirus have spread because many privilege humor and action against uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, a recycling of prejudices, xenophobia and racism has been detected to people of Chinese and east Asian origin and to people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have been observed incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility.
Reports related to Fev · (when most of the cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups throughout the world, which the Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries also found an increase in anti-Chinese feeling.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported a discrimination on their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the residents of the areas touched by the virus.
Following the progress of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, the Italian people in the first European country to rise up a serious COVID-19 epidemic could also face suspicion and xenophobie. The citizens of the countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea are in a first time signed by petitions aimed at prohibiting China to enter into their country to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become angry on Twitter.
China and the other Asian living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in racist insults and aggressions.
The American President Donald Trump made the criticism for qualifying the coronavirus of "Chine virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, manifestants attacked buss transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students originating from North-East of India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have been able to reach the coronavirus epidemic.
The President of the Bengale-O日al unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese had destroyed the nature and “that God took his opposite on them”.
The comments were then condemned by the Chinese consulat in Kolkata, which qualifies them of "fauses". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chine residents were attached by the pandemy, the strangers were described as "external waste" that he would have to "remove".
Many paying journals have revoked them for any or part of their cover on the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors have provided their scientific articles in connection with free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on publication servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratorial depistage of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detection of virus and detection of anticorps produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 RN.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of anticorps (serology) can be used at the same time for population monitoring and monitoring.
Anticorps tests show how many people have treated disease, including those whose symptoms were too much to be declared or asymptomatics.
A precise mortality rate of disease and the collective immunity level among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Because of a limited deputy, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested over 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests made in each country.
This variability is to be significantly affected by the reported letality rates, which may be considered over-estimated in some countries.
By using the inverse transcription follows a real-time polymerisation reaction (RRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngy ecuvilon or the expectation sample.
The results are usually available in a few hours at 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharynged ecovilons is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Afterward, the virus can disappear from the grass while it continues its multiplication in the powder.
In infected persons tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken in deep respiratory paths by aspiration catheter, or a crachat (expectation) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by the Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using an inverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (RRT-PCR), and was the base of 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (OMS).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test at 23 January 2020.The South Korean company KÍbiotech developed a Clinical Quality Citization Kit of SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene divided by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the use of the National Administration of Medical Products for a SARRS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR.In the United States, the Centres for Control and Prevention of diseases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) distribute their RT-PCR devices in real time of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to health workers through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the ancient versions of the test kits, a genetic test on three was obtained incomplete results due to defective reactions, as well as an outcome goulot of tests to the CCDs of Atlanta. Thus, a average of less than 100 tests per day have been treated with success during the month of February 2020.
The tests used by two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and at that time the federal and local workers received the employment of starting the depistage.
The test was approved by the Food and DrugAccession under an emergency authorisation.The United States Commercial Laboratories started the depistage at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national level of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantity limitation has been made. The collection and treatment of tests must be performed in the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre in Virology and Bio-VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Survey Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test in COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA's employment for a test that could be performed in large quantities at 3.5 hours, so that an apparatus was performed at approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an authorisation for the use of emergency (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on the Abbott 2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an US from the FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the isotherme enhancement of nuclear acids instead of the PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these apparatus in the United States, and Abbott intends to intensify the manufacture to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal anticorps that is particularly in the protein of the nucleocapside (proteine N) of the new coronavirus in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a rapid grippe test.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that “poulmonary radiographics have a low value in the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometer] can be concluded before even the appearance of symptoms. ”
Among the typical symptoms on the TDM, there are multi-lobry multi-lob depth opacities with a periferic, asymetrical and later distribution.
A sub-pleural predominance, a crazy paving and a consolidation develops as the disease is developed.
A study comparing PCR to the TDM in Wuhan, on the basis of the current pandemy, suggested that the TDM is just more sensitive than the PCR, even less precisely, several of its results of image coincidence with other paintings and diseases.
In March 2020, the American Radio College recommends that “the TDM is not used for the depistage or as a first line test for the COVID-19”.In March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for the initial depth.
The production of anticorps, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in persons from about 7 days after the symptoms appear, to determine immunity and in the monitoring of the population.The tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by test on the head of the patient (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
High-depth automated systems of many clinical workshops are able to perform these analyses, but their ability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the TLC, only one periferic blood sample is usually used, although series of samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For the PoCT, one single blood sample is usually taken by skin pointing.
In the difference of PCR methods, no stage of extraction is required before analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 entities who have duely informed the Agency and who can now distribute their anti-corps depisting tests.
On 7 April 2020, a single test was approved by the FDA in accordance with the authorisation of emergency use.Fin March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnosis and Epitope Diagnosis have received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA anticorps against virus in blood tests.
The depisting capacity is more than hundreds of samples in a few hours, which is just faster than the PCR test of the viral RNA.
The anticorps are usually detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.But April, the United Kingdom found that no anticorps test kits purchased by the country was sufficiently perfect to be used.
Hong Kong has set a plan in the context of the cases of suspicious ones to stay with them, “the emergency service will provide to the patient a sample tube”, patients crash inside, return and receive the result of the test.The British NHS announced that it conducts a pilot project to test the cases of suspects at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient does not infect others by providing a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in the case of use.In the context of the COVID-19 Drive test for the cases of suspeats, a health professional provides a test by taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres allowed South Korea to perform one of the fastest and exhaustive depistages in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Obligation Health Insurance Medicines stated on 2 March that she had the ability to perform about 12 000 tests per day, and that 10 700 patients were tested during the weekend.
The costs are supported by the disease insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
On 19 March, driver tests were available in several large towns.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests made in Germany was unknown because only the positive results were stated.
A first working study showed that at the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483 295 tests had been tested up to week 12/2020 and that 33 491 tests (6,9 %) had received a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and the Hotel Rambam developed and tested a method of analyzing the tests of 64 patients at the same time, including the samples and processing in the depths only if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, an improved work of emergency detection of 2 000 feet meters called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: gge, either "Feil" in the day of 2020) could be drawn more than 10 000 feet.
Thanks to its construction in 5 days monitored by Wang Jian, the BGI founder, the modelization showed that the cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the cost corresponding to the deployment would have doubled without this exhibition capacity.
Wuhan's workshop was quickly followed by workers Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 Chinese cities.
On 4 March 2020, the total quota capacity was up to 50 000 tests per day. Manufactured free models developed by Origami Assays were used to test up to 1 122 patients samples for the COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be exerted in small workshops without liquid robots.
In March, penalties and insufficient amounts of reaction became an extraordinary goulot for mass delay in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation encouraged some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that include the 98 °C (208 °F) samples for 5 minutes to release the RNA genes to continue depistage. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now the largest part of its population by the people of Coronavirus and were able to intensify the depistage to reach the majority of the population.
These results have been obtained by combination of the ability to conduct driver tests and buying a high-depth workshop at the level of the population at the group 42 and BGI (based on their laboratory of emergency detection "Huo-Yan" in China).
Constructed in 14 days, the laboratory is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first workshop of this ability to be operated outside China.
Miscellaneous testing formulaes, which aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile, were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits sent to low income countries without the resources necessary to develop their own kits.
The German formula was held on 17 January 2020. The United States disease control Protocol was developed only on 28 January, retarcing the testability in the United States.Chine and the United States had problems at the level of test kits reliability at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, could not provide enough kits to respond to the request and recommendations of health experts.
In contrast, experts indicate that the majority of the tests in South Korea has contributed to reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The ability to devise, in large part, in the workshops of the private sector, has been strengthened throughout several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of depistage programmes as the best way to extend the progress of the COVID-19 pandemy.The strong request for tests due to the wide distribution of the virus caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States private workshops, and the reserves of ecovilons and chemical reactions have been exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were "defects". The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private tests.Spanish buyed test kits with the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be linked to the incapacity of collecting samples or correctly using kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that he would return the kits with wrong results and replace them by another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic have provided false results.
The Prime Minister Matovič proposed to throw them into Danube. Ateş Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey stated that the test kits that Turkey bought to China had a "high error rate" and that it did not use them." The United Kingdom bought 3,5 million test kits in China, but announced that they were unusable in April 2020.
The depistage, followed by the fourteen of those receiving positive results and the tracking of persons in contact with the portfolio of SARS-CoV-2, has given positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place of the first death linked to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests to the total population of approximately 3.400 people, about 10 days of interval.
Approximately half of the people who received a positive result had no symptoms, and all the cases covered were set in quaranta.
With the limitation of movements in the commune, this measure has completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to the aggressive track of contacts, the incoming travel restrictions, the depisting and the quarantine, the coronavirus pandemy of 2020 in Singapore has progressed sooner than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and sales institutions in detail.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay with them on 28 March, but schools round at the date of the end of the vacation on 23 March.
Many other countries also managed the pandemia using an aggressive track of contacts, restrictions on incoming travels, depisting and caranting, but with less aggressive restrictions such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study discovered that countries who have performed most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower letality rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have only symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries without analysis capacity and national workers have only a limited experience of the COVID-19 sent their first five positive tests and ten first negative tests from COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference workers to perform confirmation tests.
Among the 16 reference workers, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 inside.
In the following table, the column “Positive in % of tests” depends on national detrimental policy.
A country that tests that the persons accepted to the hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country testing the enthusiasm of citizens, which have or not symptoms, other factors are the same.
The lavage of hands, also called hygiene of hands, corresponds to the fact of cleaning hands in order to restore the salt, grass, micro-emissions or other adverse substances.
The systematic weapons of hands with sane to some "key moments" of the day prevents the propagation of many diseases, such as diarrhee and cholera, which are transmitted by gold-fühlal way.
It is possible to contradict respiratory diseases such as grippe or rume, for example, by laying hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (c.-d. muckles).
It is important to lay hands on the sun at five key moments of the day: before and after defeating, after cleaning the feet of a child or changing his beds, before eating a child, before and after preparing food or manipulation of flesh, fish or crushed flight.
If you don't have water or sugar under your hand, you can lay your hands on the scene. The World Health Organization recommends to lay hands:
before, while and after preparation of food;
before and after he was occupied with a sick person;
after changing the beds of a child or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after being mocked or exhausted;
after touching a animal, food for animals or animal residues;
Hygiene in medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
The fact of laying hands before administration of medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the propagation of diseases.
The main medical goal of the hand lavage is of eliminer patogenic agents (bacteria, virus or other micro-equivalents that may cause diseases) and chemical products, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical area, but also for the great public.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including the reduction of the propagation of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; the prevention of diarrhee infectious causes; the reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as reduction of the infantial mortality rate in household accommodations.
According to a study conducted in 2013, improvement of hand hygiene practices could lead to improvement of children's growth in less than five years.
In developing countries, infantile mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhee can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as lavating hands to safe.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate related to these diseases by approximately 50 %.
The establishment of actions to promote the lavage of hands could reduce about one third diarrhee episodes, comparable to that obtained by providing potential water to low income regions.
Laying hands on the safe allows 48% to reduce diarrhee episodes and constitutes the most efficient and less costful way to prevent the diarrhee and the aid respiratory infections (IRA). It is an act that must be made automatically in the homes, schools and communities of the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality in children less than five years, which makes approximately 1,8 million victims per year.
Inside the diarrhee and pneumonia, every year the death of approximately 3,5 million children leads to death.
According to the CEF, the fact of taking the habit of laying hands with sugar before and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce by nearly half the deaths of the diarrhee and of a quarter the deaths imputable to the acid respiratory infections.
The lavage of hands is usually associated with other health measures in the framework of the water, asylum and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The lavage of hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct contact.
Minimum delegate effect, frequency lavage of hands can cover the skin by providing a cut disorder.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that heavy lavage of hands could lead to echema or dermatite at the level of hands, characterised by squamous skin and demangeous, especially frequent in health workers.
The too frequent lavage of hands is also considered one of the symptoms of the compulsional disorder (TOC).
It is important to lay hands at five key moments of the day to reduce the air-fface transmission of diseases: before and after use of the toilets (mixation, defeation), after cleaning the feet of a child (or changed his beds), before eating a child, before and after preparing food or manipulating meat, fish or crushed flight.
It is also necessary to laugh the hands correctly to prevent the transmission of diseases, especially before and after the injury of a coupure or of a wound, after being exhausted, seated or mixed, after touching animal wastes or manipulating animals and after touching orders.
In many countries, the rate of cleaning of hands to safe is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries and with the hygiene of hands, 38.7% of the medium-sound-handed employees showed that it was the highest rate in Saudi Arabia (97%), the United States were in the middle of table (77 %) and China showed the lower rate (23 %). Today there are several methods to develop the behaviour and democracy the use of the suin for the laying of hands at the key days of the day. In particular, in developing countries, it is intended to propose the students to lay hands in the group at the precise time of the day so that children may make this habit.
For example, the Philippines Education Ministry implemented a "Prior healthcare programme" in order to promote children's health and education.
The deparsition twice a year, associated with daily lavage of hands to sane and daily teeth brossing with a fluored dentifrice, is in the heart of this national programme.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate the microems presented on the skin, it is appropriate to acquire sains or water detergents.
The main action of scientists and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solution.
The only water is not an effective cleaning for the skin because the lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the ground, are hardly solved in the water.
A suitable water depth, however, easily cleaning.
The solid snow, due to its reusable nature, can rebuild issues of use.
A small number of studies on the transfer of Property from solid contaminated sain concluded that the transfer was little because the mouse is recycled.
The Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) indicates that “autodistributors of liquid sugar are preferable”.
Anti-bacterian sciences were strongly recommended to those concerned about their health status.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or recommended desinfectants allows to target antibiotics residents in nature.
However, anti-bacterian sciences contain coherent antibacterian agents such as triclosan, with many resistance sockets.
Thus, even if the antibiotics resisting sockets are not the fruit of the antibacterian sciences, these may not be as effective as announced.
Besides the tensioactive and skin protection agent, the most complex formulae can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobian function, and other protective agents (ara, vitamins, menthol, extraits of plants).A rigorous analysis from the Oregon University of Health has indicated that the sains were both effective as the antibacterian sains intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate the handholders.
The warm water used to lay hands is not sufficiently cold to kill the dead.
The body temperature (37 °C) increases rapidly.
However, heavy and sweet water is more efficient than cold and sweet water to eliminate the natural oil of salt and water.
However, contrary to popular faith, scientific studies showed that the use of tide water did not contribute to reduce the microbian load on hands.
A desinfect or an antiseptic for hands is a product of hygiene of non-coated hands.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 20th century, hygiene products from non-alcool-based hands (coramicly called hydroalcool solutions, anti-septic solutions for hands or disinfecting) began to be popular.
Most of them are formulated based on isopropylic alcohol or ethatha associated with a heating agent such as the carbon (acrylic acid polymer) for → a gel, or a humeting such as glycerin to make a liquid or mouse for a greater use facility and reduce the effect of alcohol.
Diluated hydrogen peroxide strengthens the antimicrobian activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% of alcohol eliminate the germes effectively.
Hydroalcool solutions kill the steriles, multiresistent Property (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (such as HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, grippe and hepatitis) and champion.
Hydroalcool solutions containing 70 % of alcohol eliminate 99,97 % (reduction of 3,5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of 30 seconds after application and 99,99 % to 99,999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of the deficiencies presented on hands 1 minute after application.The desinfectings for hands are more efficient against the equivalents and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcool solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of counterfeit gastroenterity.A sufficient quantity of deinfecting for hands or hydroalcool solution must be used for good form or cover both hands.
The pump and the back of the two hands should be limited, as well as the interstips between the fingers and the sheets for about 30 seconds until the liquid, mouse or yellow is sucked.
The American Centre for Control and Prevention of diseases recommends the lavage of hands rather than the use of hydroalcool solutions, especially when the hands are salted.
The increased use of these products is due to their use facility and rapid elimination activity of micro-equipments; however, they should not replace a suitable lavage of hands unless you have water and sugar.
Frequent use of hydroalcool solutions may result in cut disorder if the formula is not strengthened by emulsions and/or hydrating agents of the skin.
The effects of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by embracing glucerine and/or other emulators in the formula.
In the context of clinical tests, hydroalcool solutions containing emulsions have caused just less irritation and cut sugar than antimicrobian sains or detergents.
The allergic contact dermatite, contact or hyper-equity or additives presented in hydro-alcool solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcool solutions have less trends to cause irritant contact dermatites has made them more attractive than the water and safe lavage of hands.
Despite their efficiency, non-hide products eliminate not the organic materials presented on their hands, but only disinfect them.
That is why the disinfectants for hands are not as effective as the science and water to avoid propagation of many patogenic agents, since these last ones remain on their hands.
The efficiency of deinfectants for non-alcool hands depends strongly on ingredients and formula, and has always been clearly lower than the alcohol and alcohol-based deficiencies.
Recently, the formulaes used by benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobian activity after application, in the difference of alcohol, which is achieved after repeated use, probably due to progressive cutanated adverse reactions.
In low income populations, many are those who do not have the way to buy safe, and who use the censure or the earth instead.
Centry or the earth can be more effective than the only water, but less than it knows.
Moreover, if the earth or the cemetery is contaminated by microemes, it can increase the propagation of diseases instead of breathing it.
Inside the shadow, the census is also a deinfecting agent because, in contact with water, it forms a alcaline solution.
WHO recommends the censure or the sand as alternative to the sun when it is not available.
The United States Centre for the Control and Prevention of diseases recommends correctly laying hands to prevent the transmission of diseases, as follows:
I have hands with courant water thick or cold.
The water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnating water points, while the water temperature does not make differences.
Make a generous quantity of sain on the hands by striking them against the other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the angles.
The sun removes the skin wings, and studies show that people have the tendency to lay their hands more carefully when they use sane than with the only water.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action to frotter growing fraction, which helps to eliminate the skin wheels, and to flourish longer from the wheat.
Rain too much to the courant water.
Renaming in a stagnating water bassin can lead to the reanimation of hands.
Sleep with a clean or free air.
The most often forgotten areas are the puzzle, the pointing, the spaces between the fingers and the beaches.
The artificial sheets and the vernis on the e.g. can have microequivalents.
A hydrated lotion is often recommended to avoid having sucking hands; the skin sugar promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash the hands when the water of the robet and/or the safe is not available. For example, to cool water from a bidon or a wooden and/or to use the cender if needed, in developing countries.In the situations where water supply is limited (as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economy water, such as "typepy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple hold that uses a suspended cross using a ring, and a pedal that allows a small quantity of water on hands and a sain bread.
Effective shutting of hands is a key part of the hygiene process of hands, but the best way to shut up hands in the toilet is discussed.
More research suggests that paper-services are much more hygiene than electric sugars than they are often located in the toilet.
In 2008, a study financed by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the Westminster University (Londres), to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper-services, warm air sugar morning and the more modern air-sook morning.
Following the lavage and shutting of hands at warm air tomorrow, it was shown that the total number of tissues increased in average of 194 % on the finger pulp and 254 % on the powder.
The sugar seed in the morning was a average increase in the total number of tears on the powder of 42 % and 15 % powder.
Following the lavage and sucking of hands with a paper-sheet, the total number of deteriorations was reduced by 76% in average on the fingerprint and up to 77% on the powder.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential of crossed contamination with the other toilet users and the toilet environment according to each sugar method.
The aircraft suit morning, which suffles from air outside the device with 180 m/s annual speed (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to exhaust microems from hands and apparatus and eventually contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 metres.
The use of a warm air sugar day allows micro-equivalents to distribute at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters of the morning sugar.
In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Product and Environment, various methods of sucking of hands were evaluated.
After hand shutting, the following variations were observed:
There are many different sugar manufacturers, and the sugars have been compared to sealing with paper seeds.
The lavage of hands with disinfectable tabs is a alternative solution during movements, in the absorption of safe and water.
Hydroalcool solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The lavage of hands in medical environment has become obligatory well after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis has discovered its efficiency (in 1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when the hospital staff forgets to lay hands.
A study showed that their use would lead to decreasing infection rates.
The medical lavage of the hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generic quantity of sweet and water or gel to mouse and break each part of the hands.
The hands must be stripped against the other by binding between the fingers.
In case of residues under the sheets, it is possible to use a powder brown to remove them.
As the worms presented in the water are possible to stay on the hands, it is important to renew and try with a clean seret.
After sucking, the paper seed must be used to close the robet (and open the output door if appropriate).
This allows us to avoid retaking hands to the surface contact.
The objective of lavaging hands in health structures is to remove the pathogenic microems (hermes) and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand cleaning rate remains unacceptable in most of the medical institutions, a large number of doctors and infirmers who are regularly forgotten to lay their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microemes.
According to a study, the decreasing of hands correctly and following other simple procedures may reduce 66% of the rate of blood infections related to categoryes. The World Health Organization has a brochure described the standard procedure to be followed in order to lay and break hands in the field of health.
The draft directive on hygiene of hands established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect the comments of the internets.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
Manufacturers available in the trade may measure and certifie the hygiene of the hands if the regulation is subject to.
The World Health Organization defines " Five indications" concerning the hygiene of the hands:
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before a aseptic gesture; and
after having been contacted with the patient, the fact that the antiseptic chemicals to the saon (sounds "medicals" or "antimicrobians") results in the lavage agent of hands in the destruction of the germes.
It is desirable to elimine these germes before performing a chirurgical operation or in environments where the residents of antibiotics are very extended. To "frotter" the hands for a chirurgical operation, it is necessary to have a robet that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a product of clorhexidine or iodic lavage, of sterile servings to cut off their hands after they have laved them, of a sterile browsing to float and of another sterile tool to clean under the bottles.
All the birds must be removed.
In the framework of this procedure, hands and pre-brases are needed to be laid up to coal, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to break hands for 10 minutes.
During the rice, the water on the pre-brases is not running up to the hands.
Once the hands were laid, hands should be cut with a sterile ling and thrown a chirurgical box.
In order to reduce the propagation of germes, it is preferred to lay hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after being occupied with a sick person.
With regard to the monitoring of staphylococ infections in hospitals, the main benefits of hand-laving were obtained in the first 20% of the lavage, and there were only little additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand-lavage above 35%.
If we compare the lavage of hands made with an antibacterian sane, the rate of infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing the cleaning of hands with a based alcohol solution and the lavage of hands with an antibacterian sain during a average period of 30 seconds, the first reduces the contamination of 26% compared to the second.
In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care institutions, it is possible, in particular, to form the staff in the lavage of hands, to put more alcohol based products on the disposal of it and to address him written and recorded memories on this subject.
More research is needed to discover the most effective interventions in various health structures.
In developing countries it is considered that the lavage of hands to safe is a small and essential tool that allows health protection, even to eat properly.
However, because of the lack of reliable water points, sane or installations to lay hands in the house, in the oil and on the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal habits in the area of hygiene of hands.
For example, in the major part of rural Africa, it is rare to find robots to lay hands close to private or private toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand lavage stations.
However, the low lavage rates of hands may also be imputable to tennis habits, rather than to a lack of sain or water.
The fact of promoting the lavage of hands to sane and conducting activities in this regard can affect political decisions, knowing the benefits of this practice and providing a long-term behavior in the population.
In order to achieve this approach, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic examination of 70 studies showed that local approaches are effective to increase the rate of hand-laving in low and intermediate income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. In the promotion of the lavage of hands in schools, it is possible to cite the example of the " Approach three stars " of the CEF, which encourages schools to take simple and less costuous measures to ensure that the ships are laying hands with sane, while respecting other hygiene rules.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand lavage stations can be included in the hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce infantile diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Lavage of Hands is another example of the campaign to promote the development of the behavior.Soon the coronavirus pandemy of 2019-2020, the CEF encouraged the adoption of an emosion that illustrates the lavage of hands.
A few studies have examined the global cost-effective report of hand-laving in developing countries in comparison with the number of years of good health life (e.g. DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of the lavage of hands to safe is just more rentable than other interventions in the field of water and asylum.
The importance of the lavage of hands for human health, especially for people in the situation of vulnerability, such as mothers who were accused of accommodation or soldiers in hospitals, was identified for the first time in the middle of the 19th century by two hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British “the founder of modern carecares”.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were two of the fetides called mixed.
In 1980, food origin epidemies and nosocomial infections led the American Centres to control and prevention of diseases to enhance the hygiene of hands as a essential means to prevent infection propagation.
The appearance of the green influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemy in 2020 led to a greater consciousness in many countries regarding the need to lay hands with shane to prejudice these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, the “good hand lavage techniques ” were placed at the neighbourhoods and in the toilets of offices and airports.
The expression "laughing their hands" refers to a person to assume the responsibility or to be complicated of something.
It is issued of a Bible verse of Matthew in which Ponce Pilate lays the hands of the decision to crucif Jesus Christ, but this expression was broadly spread in certain communities.
In Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth undertakes to lay hands in compulsive way to try to clean a imaginary tackle, symbol of her bad consciousness regarding the crimes she committed and incitated her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after remembering that they had committed ethical acts contrary or intended to do so, have tend to lay their hands more often than others and to give more value to the hand-laving devices.
Furthermore, those who are authorised to lay their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclinated to give themselves to other compensatory measures of purification, such as the benefit.
Certain religions prescribed the lavage of hands for the purposes of hygiene and symbolic. The symbolic lavage of the hands, which consists of using water and not of the safe to lavage hands, is part of the rituals of the lavage of hands in many religions, including the laisism and hyndouism, the inmersion (tevilah) and the ritual ablution of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in the Jewishism, the lavabo in the Christianism and the wudhu in the islam. The religions also provide the lavage of hands for hygiene purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to the Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam, it is obligatory to lay hands after he went to the toilet.
Similarly, the hindouism, the buddhism, the sikhism, the Jewishism and the Islam requires to lay hands before and after each food.
COVID-19's risk controls on the workplace
COVID-19's risk checks on the workplace indicate the implementation of health and safety methods for the monitoring of risks in order to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate risk controls on the workplace varies the workplace and tasks based on a assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to an infection by COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Affairs (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with less risk of exposure have a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only the basic preventive measures against infection are recommended, including the lavage of hands, the encouragement of workers to stay in the house if they are sick, the respiratory label and the maintenance of a cleaning and the disintegration of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk employment includes those needing frequent or close contacts with persons without a suspicious or known COVID-19 but may be infected because of a current Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the large public, in particular in schools, high-population work environments and certain detailed environments.
The risk controls in this group, including the basic measures for preventing infection, include a ventilation with highly efficient air filters, hygiene vitres and a individual protection equipment in case of meeting with a person reached by COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspicioned or known COVID-19 as a high risk of exposure, which is a very high risk if they make aerosol processes or premises or manipulations of persons with a suspicioned or known COVID-19.
The risk checks for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemies may have multiple effects on the workplace.
Workers can be absent because they have fallen sick, have to take care of others or fear a possible exhibition.
Commercial models can change both the goods requested and the means to purchase them (including to make their courses outside the hours of point or use of delivery or drive services).
Finally, the sending of articles from severely affected geographical regions from the COVID-19 can be suspended. A preparation and response plan to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take account of the risk levels associated with different jobs and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors related to the family and Community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathology.
They also lose the necessary controls to face these risks and emergency plans for the situations that may be presented after epidemies.
Preparation and response plans to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to a epidemic include the reduction of transmission among staff, the protection of people with higher risk of medical complications, the maintenance of commercial operations and the reduction of side effects on other entities of their supply chain.
The severity of disease in the community where the enterprise is influenced by the answers applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms a global framework used in health and safety in the work to group risk controls by efficiency.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are the technical controls, monitoring administrative controls, and finally individual protection equipment.
Technical controls involve isolation of the work-related risks without having to rest on the behaviour of workers, which can constitute the most economic solution to implement.
Administrative controls designate the changes of policies or procedures to work needed by the employer or employer.
The individual protection equipment (PI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but it can contribute to prevent certain expositions.
All types of PI must be selected in accordance with the risk for the worker, correctly adapted to the needs (e.g. respiratory masks), correctly and systematicly, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced, and correctly removed, cleaned and stored to any contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Propertyation (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with less risk of exposure have a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic measures for prevention of infection recommended for all workshops include a frequency and minute lavage of the hands, the encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory label, in particular covering the mouth and nose to cut and outside, providing mosquies and powder, telephone preparation or working hours, dissuasion of workers to use the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining cleaning and disabilities of the work environment.
The identifier and quick isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial stage of the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others on a workplace.
The Centers for the Monitoring and Prevention of Sickness (CDC) in the United States recommend employees with adequate respiratory disease symptoms to stay at home until they have no more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms since at least 24 hours without use of febrifuges or other drugs that act on symptoms; they also recommend to apply flexible disease congestion policies, to allow employees to stay home to take care of a member of the disease family and to inform the employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-exposition risk employment includes those needing a frequency or heavy contact at least six feet (1.8 m) of persons without a suspicioned or known COVID-19 but who can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to a Community transmission around the company's seat or because the person has recently conducted a international travel in a region with an extended transmission from the COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the large public, in particular in schools, high-population work environments, and some high-volume detailing environments. Technical controls for this group and higher risks include the installation of highly efficient air filters, the maintenance of ventilation rates, the installation of barriers such as hygiene in transparent plastics and the installation of a driver window for the customer service. Administrative controls for this group and the highest risk include the promotion of sick workers to stay at the house, replacement of meetings in persons by communications and promotion, promotion of job protection, public protection, interruption of non-necessary travels to the financing of the COVP regions, promoting and promotion of financing and financing, financing and financing, promotion of public protection, promotion of non-economic works, promotion of the workshops and promotional works, promotion and promotion of the financing, promotion of the promotion of the promotion of work, promotion, promotion of the promotion of the public and promotion of the work, promotion of the work, promotion of the work, and promotion of the , promotion of the work and promotion of CUE and promotion of the CUE, promotion of the work, promotion of the , promotion of the work, and promotion of the work and promotion of the promotion of the , promotion of the , promotion of the public, promotion of the tion of the work and promotion of the , promotion of the promotion of the promotion of the promotion of the public and promotion of non-up of the public and promotion of non- the work, promotion of the work, promotion of non-
Workers of this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls sick at a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separate the disease from others by a distance of 6 feet, design a member of the team to take care of the disease and offer a protection mask to the sickness or ask him to cover the mouth and the nose with the help of the weapons when he is all or foreign.
Cabine equipment must be carried out with jetable medications when it takes care of a sick passenger or affects organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the disease passenger presents the fever, a persistent tough or respiratory difficulties.
For commercial navigation, including cross-balls and other passenger battles, risk controls include the report of the travel in the case of disease and the auto-isolation and immediate information of the board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, an isolated person's cabine should be monitored in the medical monitoring. For school and children's care institutions, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and deinfection if a infected person has been in a school-based, independently of the Community propagation.
In the case of a minimum Community transmission to moderate, social distance strategy can be implemented, such as cancellation of pedagogical outputs, assemblies and other important races such as education or coral courses or feed at the cantine, increased space between offices, scaling the hours of archaeze and output, reducing non-essential visitors and using separate heritage for children with grip symptoms.
In the case of a major transmission in the local community, including social distance strategy, a long-term school vacation can be considered. For the forces of the order that perform daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered as low by CDCs.
Agencies of the order forces that must contact persons with COVID-19 sospesed or confirmed shall follow the same directives as the ambulances, including the port of an appropriate individual protection equipment.
In the case of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and deinfecte their equipment and service ceinture before reuse using a box or a spray deterrent manage and follow the standard config and reception procedures used by the EPIs, as well as the confining and clothing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers as part of higher or very higher risk of exposure categories.
High exhibition risk jobs include health, support, labor and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspicious or known COVID-19.
They become very highly exposure workers if they make procedures that produce air-sols or pre-process or manipulation of patients with suspicious or known COVID-19 tests.
The procedures produced by airlines include inbuction, touch induction procedures, bronchoscopies, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive invasion of samples.
The high-exposure workers include the workers involved in preparing people's body with COVID-19 suspicioned or known at their death; they pass to a very high risk of exposure if they practice autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 sospesed or known, including during the implementation of air-producing procedures.
A specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral environments.
The samples must be manipulated using biological safety precautions at level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to separate patients coming into separate wait rooms depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. Furthermore, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons who work at least 6 feet of patients with a suspicioned or known infection by SARS-CoV-2 and for those who make aerosol processes.
In the United States, N95 or highly approved NIOSH respiratory masks must be used in the context of a full and written programme of respiratory protection including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide a higher protection and better comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends the port of a chirurgical mask only by the depistage staff at the income point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, carry on or transport COVID-19 patients in the absorption of aerosol processes, the WHO recommends a chirurgical mask, protection lamps or face-ran, blue and candle.
In the case of aerosol process, the chirurgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Since the world supply of EPI is insufficient, the WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI through telemedicin, barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a COVID-19 to individuals directly involved in its care, the use of EPIs that are required for the special task only, the use of the same spirit mask without rejecting it for the support of several patients with the same cup, the monitoring and operation of the EPI's supply chain and the disuse of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

Objective: [Covid-19] Allow load and prepare the future
DATE/HOWN: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No right reserved
We find us this month in an exceptional situation.
COVID-19's epidemic is a demonstration of our global hum's interconnection and the responsibility we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unnecessary, but we know that our best response is on the type of empathy, cooperation and strengthening of the Community at the world level that is in the heart of this organization.
The camerary and the welfare we have observed among all our e-mails, calls and instantious conversations are a wonderful testimony of incredible human beings with whom we have the opportunity to work.
I couldn't be more eager and proud to count you all among my ecstasy.
Last week, someone made me part of his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at this time, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible through your work, that you maintain the operational sites, take care of the payment of our communities or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
It is a moment when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
As a result of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will follow the following adjustments of the way we work from the next week.
Adjustments of our work and time employment
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our time employment in the days and months to come.
We have discussed what would be an adjusted response to the situation in which we face and the best way to ensure the viability of the organization during this period.
We first had to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take a breakfast, don't worry.
All members of the staff, subtractors and contractuals:
Our daily worktime goal will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week to the new order.
We don't declare a ferry day: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful for the mission.
However, the world is imprisoned at the present time, and if you need to take care of your neighbors, make courses or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No illness or payable delay required: simply prevent your superior and help your team to review the calendars and jobs of time to ensure that main work are covered.
(If you are positive in the COVID-19, you should prevent Bryan from T&amp;C Ops to help T&amp;C and make sure your situation receives the necessary attention of the direction).
The time staff will be completely rewarded.
We have already announced it, and we will repeat our commitment to honour our responsibility to our sub-treaters and our members of the time staff.
Everyone will be rewarded on the basis of his ordinary working hours under normal conditions.
It's worth if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do may be incredible, especially in periods like this.
Once again, the goal is to keep you.
We simply ask you to be with your superior, so that we know what we are waiting for and we can take the necessary provisions.
Certain tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we need to continue to do.
SRE, Ops RH, Confidence & amp; Security and Fund Collection (e.g.) perform a key work that might need strength.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and to support the tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we are just going to work on the most important projects.
Now, relaxation will not do bad later.
We do not intend to "work two times more to take away the lost time" when the pandemy is going to pass.
We will not ask you to make additional hours to respect now irrealistic times.
We believe that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set up new objectives and efficiently as appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt us to our new reality and daily worktime objectives, we intend to adjust the effort to deliver our annual plan 2020-2012.
Our aim is to propose a plan for 2019-2020, which provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to work on the essential work, to take care of them and their neighbors while adapting to those who need or want to see their latest working time in the next weeks.
This prolongation of expansions reduces the load of work and pressure of the current planning in the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and teams of the next steps after confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we have learned that one of our clusters based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by excess of density, we called an antiviral cleaning team to deinfect all the surfaces of the Office of San Francisco.
They used an antiviral hospital quality solution to deinfect all surfaces, as well as the income hall and ascensor boxes leading to our stage.
The building has made its own protocol for the debt of diligence that uses products to ensure the safety of its locals.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we will decide to return to it.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which shared with us and the members of the staff based on Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration to San Francisco's advice.
As some of our ecclesiastes established in New York know, we also discussed the idea of celebrating a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but they could be updated.
Some of our ecclesiastes work a distance for the first time.
Our habitual work at remote work realized that adjustment could be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Decrease the time of meetings at meetings for one or two hours.
If longer meetings are necessary, consider to divide them in several days.
Define the meeting, have a agenda order and send the documentation forward.
Make videos the standard by means of tools such as Google Docs and Zoom in order to promote direct and direct trade.
Dispose of a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instantious conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or to take collective notes).
Send a electronic cure to the technical support if you need a comfortable cask.
Use your refrigeration well-being for employment.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your work distribution
The RH operations team studies ethnic directives based on web-lines to support the distribution of work in the Fund.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of the Community subvention of the public events financed by Wikimedia, such as the edit-a-thons, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemy.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to achieve their agreed subvention activities and that no one would be penalized in the case of retaliation or change of these objectives.
The next week, we will make additional directives on Wikimania and other thematic and regional Community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community → to be ashamed of the disturbance and disturbance in front of clarity and the possibility of becoming on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
For the next time, the CRT works on the creation of a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in contact despite the problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for a extraordinary meeting of the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will benefit from this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spending time in.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you anyway.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this electronic currency and all other essential information related to the COVID-19 of the Wiki Office.
The CRT will update these pages and raise all information at the same place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with the members of the residue staff in countries that are currently seriously touched.
If you have questions about movements, events, important work flows or cover difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not need to predict and work with the CRT.
We're here to support you and ensure the connection where appropriate.
For any confidential or sensitive question, please send a electronic cure to Bryan Judan, the international international transactions RH.
No of these amendments should be considered as a abandon of our work and our obligations.
In contrast, it is recognizing that our work and our obligations are probably to be adapted in a senseless way.
These steps are the steps we consider necessary to support us mutually and can continue our work, bring to our movement the help he needs, and offer to the world the service on which everyone can count.
Our planned work will be there to wait for us when it comes.
Instead, it is time to enter into and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and maybe the next months.
We need each of you to reach it, therefore you must keep and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself the time come.
Finally, please: lay your hands and do not touch your face!

b'The conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external (cellular membranes) of the powder cells, arters, hearts, renes and instincts.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin convert enzyme (ACE) reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increased Ang (1-7) which makes it a promised medical target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of introduction in the cells of some coronavirus.
The enzyme version of hum’s enzyme is often designed under the name of hACE2.
The conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc at the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a M2 field of peptidae to termination N and a field of collection of renal amino acid transporter C.
ACE2 is a single member-member protein of type I, with the active area on the enzymatic level is exposed on the surface of powder cells and other tissues.
The extracellular area of the ACE2 is removed from the transmembranary area by another enzyme called sheddase; the solution protein that results is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is presented in most of the bodies: ACE2 is mainly linked to cell membrane of the pulmonary alveol cells of type II, gray intestin entherocytes, artificial and vineyard cells and artificial cells of the most organ muscle muscles.
The expression of the ARNm of the ACE2 is also presented in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalam and cerebral tro.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to hold the ACE.
ACE claims the angiotensine hormone I in angiotensine II vasoconstric.
ACE2 turns the amino phenylamina acid to carboxyl carboxyle of angiotensine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and the hydrolyse in vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also climb several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinine, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grain.
The ACE2 also regulates the membranary employment of the SLC6A19 neutre acid transporter and is involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As transmembran protein, the ACE2 is the main input point in certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SRAS virus) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus originating in COVID-19).
More precisely, the association of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 protein S1 to the ACE2 enzymatic area to the surface of cells results in endocytose and translocation both virus and enzyme in endosome in the cells.
This input process also needs the initialization of protein S by host-serial protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of this last is currently the subject of investigation as possible treatment. This leads to some to think that reduction of ACE2 rates in cells can contribute to combat infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended to continue standard treatment with the ACE and ARB inhibitor.
A systematic review and meta-analysis on 11 July 2012 showed that “the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34 % of pneumonia risk compared to witnesses”.
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated by ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular the victims of AVC and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction of the mortality associated with pneumonia, although the results were less evident than for the global risk of pneumonia. ”
The conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 recombinant hum (rhACE2) is pressure as a renewing treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and improve pulmonary hemodynamic and saturation in oxygen in porcelets with acid respiratory disorder syndrome produced by lipopolisaccharide.
The half-life of the rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes more than the 24-hour efficacy duration.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for people who are intolerant to the classic inhibitors of renin-angiotensin (SRA) or for diseases with high angiotensin II.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracking of contacts in the context of the coronavirus pandemy 2019-20, namely identifying people ("contakts") which may be in contact with a infected person.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been set up for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those who are focused on the trace of the geographical emission of application users, arise issues regarding privacy.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the closeness of a user with other portable phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced jointly the direct integration in their Android and iOS operational systems to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese Government, in → with Alipay, has developed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has chosen for an application named TraceTogether.
It was developed by a local community of informants, which was provided in open source and will be delivered to the Government. The North Macedonia launched "StartKorona!", a Bluetooth application which ensures the tracking of the exposure to potentially infected people and quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application was expected to approve by the Google Play Store and App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the application of contact tracking was a progressive development stage and could be developed during the next weeks.
Australia and New Zealand intend to implement applications on the model of TraceTogether in Singapore and on the basis of BlueTrace Protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geoperation application for patients with a COVID-19 and resistance in Moscou to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambria, has raised a number of possible practical problems relating to the use of systems based on applications, including false positive and lack of potential efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns on the propagation of false or damage applications “coronavirus”, Apple only implies“ official” or generally worth confidence to use applications related to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Soldiers for the protection of private life have been involved in their concerns on the implications of coronavirus applications in mass monitoring, in particular the possibility of the supervisory infrastructure created to face coronavirus pandemia once the distant threat.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have made a statement calling for the limitation of this type of supervision.
These organizations have set up eight conditions to be respected in the framework of government projects:
monitoring should be "necessary, and proportional" ;
Control and monitoring operations should be conducted by extinction clauses ;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the COVID-19;
data safety and anonymate should be protected in a demonstrable manner ;
digital monitoring should ensure preventing any accuracy of discrimination and marginalisation ;
any share of data with thirds should be defined in the law ;
Protection against abuse and resources for citizens should be provided for in case of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all interested parties would be obligatory, including those of health experts and marginalised groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters without frontiers (Reporter without border) (RSF) in Germany have also made check lists.
The plan proposed by Google/月e aims to attack the problem of sustaining a monitoring by eliminating the tracking mechanism of their equipment when it is not necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocalisation system instead of applications, which eliminates the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network tracking was approved.
Network solutions with access to brutal geolocalisation data have important problems in respect of private life.
However, all systems on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows private life to be respected (see section Next).
In South Korea, a system that does not refer to an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a given application, the system collected tracking information to various sources, including the data on tracking of mobile apparatus and transactions by card, which they later associated to send warnings by SMS to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of these information to warn potential contacts, the Government also provided information about public locations, which was allowed by the deep changes made to the confidentiality laws of information after the MERS epidemic that touched this country.
These information are available to the public through several websites and applications. These countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve private life.
The details have not been made on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of contacts relating to the private life is a well established concept, which has been set up by a large volume of research data since 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than one twelve expert groups worked on solutions relating to private life, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the closeness of a user with other mobile phones.
However, project PEPP-PT is an effort to associate with centralized and decentralised approaches and is not a unique protocol. The decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, previously called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), including.
These protocols allow to ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all corresponding posts are effected on the device.
The Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab now develops SafePaths, a platform for use of private life preservation techniques in collection and use of localization or contact data to follow the COVID-19 propagation.
This technique is based on the results of the white book Apps Gone Rogue: holdtaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic in March 2020. The SafeTrace of Enigma MPC, a company who develops the protection of private life initially based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses safe materials to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the International CCN Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and protocols essentially equivalent to reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global interoperability of trace and warning applications, a key factor of their adoption by a broad public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, who control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts, stateing that it would allow private life to be kept and associated with Bluetooth Low Energy and a cryptography that ensures confidentiality.
They also performed the specifications of the baselines used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be developed in three phases:
deployment of tools allowing governments to create official applications for the trace of coronavirus respecting private life
direct integration of this function in iOS and Android. Google and Apple are intended to resolve the problems of adoption of the solution and maintenance of monitoring by initially distributing the system through the updates of the operational system and submitting it later on the same way as the distant threat.
The reposition of a medicinal product (a.k.a. reorientation, reprofilation, reaffectation or therapy change of a medicinal product) indicates the reconversion of a medicinal product approved for a disease or a different medical affection than that for which it was initially developed.
It is a scientific research axis currently studied to develop safe and effective treatment against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of convalent persons. SARS-CoV-2 presents approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of them with several linking sites.
The analysis of these link sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral medicinal product against the proteins of the COVID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, the protease of the papaine type, the ARN polymerase depending, the helicopter, the protein S and the ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, and al. have studied several candidate components that have then optimized and analysed to determine their structural similarity with the most approved medicines to accelerate the development of a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinic study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.

The Governor of New York, Andrew Chomme, announced that the tests of the New York State on chlorokine and hydrochlorokine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorised the use of the hydroxichlorokin and the chlorokin phosphate according to an emergency authorisation (USA).
The treatment was not approved by the clinical test process of the FDA and is only authorised by the EUA as a experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that “the use, dose or duration of hydroxychlorocin for prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection is not yet established.
The doctors indicated use of this medicinal product “if there is no other option”.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chlorokine in 日 with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
A larger study is in Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School performs a test on the safety and efficiency of the prevention of hydroxychlorokine use.
Chinese clinical trials performed in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "effectly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative in a average time of 4 days while the disease duration was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan of 240 patients suffering from pneumonia, half of the favipiravir and the other half of the humifenovir received.

It may not be sure for women who are sick or who are trying to create.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that no benefit was observed.
These medicines were designed to inhibate HIV replication by linking to protease.
A team of researchers from the Colorado University tends to find these medicines to find a composition that would be with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are critics in the scientific community regarding the use of resources for the replacement of medicinal products especially for HIV/SIDA.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and virus infections Marburg. Gilead Sciences then discovered that the remdesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several filovirus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause a severe disease and a severe transmission.
Some previous studies before the test suggest that the remdezivir may have a high genetic barry against resistance. Several clinical trials are current, including two of them conducted by Cleveland university hospitals; one of the people who suffer from a moderate pathology and the other on the more serious forms.
There are three clinical tests on intraveinous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously sick from the COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (Chine and Canada) and one without control (Italia).
New York State started tests relating to azitromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.

A multicenter study of 300 patients studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in prevention and therapeutic doses was an anniversary in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have been subject to the reposition of approved antiviral medicines that have been developed for previous epidemies such as MERS, SRAS and the Western Nil virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19日 at the 7th edition of Chinese directives
Umifenovir: Umifenevir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19日 at the 7th edition of Chinese directives
Some antibiotics were identified as potentially repositionable as treatments of COVID-19:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also current in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical tests, many development trials are on.
Final February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, virus from the origin of the disease before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were studying phase I security.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was stated throughout the world in 2020, generating important investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use genemens to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the impacts of the EESC's initiative for the establishment of a vaccine are the speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, the CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different platforms were conducting research and development projects starting in 2020 in order to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform in phase I safety studies include:
Nuclear acid (DNA and ARN) (fase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (fase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenoviral vector
As the CEPI scientists said in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are in the first stages of development of 78 (79 of the Milken Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 other announced years, but with little information available (presumed in planning or design).
A phase I-II test is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and performed in several centres, determining more effective doses.
Phase III tests usually include more participants, including a group of witnesses, and test the effectiveness of vaccine in the prevention of disease, while monitoring the adverse effects on optimal dose.
Among the 79 active development vaccines candidates (confirmed by April 2020), 74 were not yet in the evaluation phase on the human person (always "preclinic" research).

In March 2020, the American Government, the industry and three universities joined their resources to access IBM superordinators, associated with information resources on the cloud of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have hetherogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they predict.
Another randomly test is expected of 4 170 health professionals.
The current development vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficiency of a vaccine using specific animal models for the COVID-19, such as ACE-2 transgenic mouse, other working animals, non-human primates, indicate the need to implement biosecurity config measures for the manipulation of live virus, and a international system to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vacuums against SRAS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020 there is no curative or protective vaccine against SRAS that has demonstrated its safety and effectiveness in humans.
According to research documents in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAS was a priority for the governments and the whole world health agencies.There are no vaccines tested against MERS.
When MERS spread, the SRAS research could be used as a model to develop vaccines and medicines against infection in MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, one single vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical tests in humans and three other; all vaccines were on viral vector, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one to MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have distributed a theory of the complex which the virus from the origin of the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social network publications refer to existing patents relating to genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus sockets such as SRAS coronavirus.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acid respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Corrent symptoms include fibre, tough, and exhaust.
Other symptoms may include weakness, muscle pain, diarrhee, fat, gog loss and abdominal pain.
The time between the exposure and the appearance of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it can cook between two and forty days.
While most of the cases generate moderate symptoms, some develop to a viral pneumonia and a deficiency of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories in the world, which were born more than 153.000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been healed. The virus is mainly spread in close contact, often by gouttelets produced by tossing, eternal or speaking.
These gouttelets are produced at the expiration, they usually fall into the ground or on surfaces rather than represent a infectional risk on long distances.
People may also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, and then by touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces until 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days following the appearance of symptoms, although the county is possible before the symptoms appearing and during the later phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the inverse transcription of polymerase reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of mask is recommended for those who think to be infected by the virus and their patients.
Recommendations on the port of the public in general are different, some authorities refusing their use, other recommending their use, and others still imposing their use.
There is currently no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of disease has been recorded in most countries in the six regions of the WHO.
Persons infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or develop gripal symptoms such as fever, tough, weakness, exhaustness.
The symptoms of urgency include difficulties to breathe, persistent toracic pressure, confusion, difficulties to walk and face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is recommended to consult a doctor immediately.
Less often, higher respiratory symptoms such as eternal, nasal ecuation or fat pain can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhee have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only a thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, disease may cause pneumonia, deficiency of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 is usually from five to six days, but can go up to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people who develop symptoms will do it within 11,5 days after infection, and reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic ports in the transmission is not yet fully known, however, preliminar elements suggest that they can contribute to the propagation of disease.
The proportion of infected people who have no symptoms is currently unknown and in the study. The Korean prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during their hospitalisation.
The Chinese National Health Committee began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; 130 (78 %) of 166 infections that this day were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectation and salive can both carry out important viral charges.
The fact of speaking strongly frees more guittellets than the fact of speaking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that without protecting it can design gouttelets at a distance of 4,5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is usually not transported by air, national scientist academy suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors placed outside the patients' rooms have produced positive tests to virus RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intrusion and reanimation (RCP) can spread respiratory secretions and thus lead to air propagation.
Although there are concerns about the propagation of cells, this risk is considered as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation can be possible before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) states that if we do not know exactly with the easierness of the disease, a person who is generally combined with two to three others.
Exactly, the virus could be detected at the end of one day on the carton, three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable acid (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on the cow of 99 %.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Sounds and detergents are also effective if they are correctly used; sain-based products decrease the protective lipidic cover of the virus, which deactivates and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate of chlorhexidine (a chirurgical desinfectation) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salive samples have been taken in average two days after the start of the hospitalisation.
In five patients in six, the first test showed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was at the second tested day.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acid acid syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe respiratory acid syndrome, initially isolated in three persons with pneumonia associated with Wuhan’s acid respiratory disease home.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus appearing in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by his own household, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a parent of the SARS-CoV of origin.
Pumons are the most touched organs of the COVID-19 because the virus is accompanied by host cells through the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the alveolary cells of type II of the powder.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "specule" (peplomer) to connect to ACE 2 and penetrate into the host cell.
Aguay heart lesions have been reported in 12% of the persons admitted to the Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more heavy.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, however, myocard’s acute lesions can also be linked to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
The recipients of ACE 2 are highly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high thrombosis ability (31 %) and vineyard thromboembolic disease (25 %) was observed in patients with intensive care units of COVID-19 infections and can be associated with a defavorable pronostic. COVID-19 killed persons have shown diffus alveolary damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing limfocytes in the pulmone.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for the epiphelial cells of the respiratory paths expressing ACE-2, patients with COVID-19 severe have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
These are, in particular, the GM-CSF secretary T cells associated with the recycling of flaming monocytes secreting IL6 and the severe pulmonary pathology of COVID-19 patients.
Limphocytary infiltrates have also been reported to the autopsy.
WHO has performed several test protocols for disease.
The standard test method uses the inverse transcription of the reaction by polymerase in real time (RRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by primely rhinopharyngy; however, a nasal or expectation can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours, even until two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however, they require two blood pressures taken at two weeks of interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus suck and did the genetic sequence so that workers around the world could develop independently the tests of polymerisation in chain (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, tests of anticorps (subsectable to decelerate active infections and previous infection of a person) were developing, but not yet broadly used.
The Chinese test experience showed a precision of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test at the closest of the patient on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. The directives of the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods of detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Opacity in glass multi-lobster depoly with a periferic, asymetrical and later distribution are typical symptoms at the beginning of the infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobulary sect exhibition with variable alveolary complication) and consolidation can occur with the progression of the disease.
No data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological detections of autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuration, pericardite, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edem
Four types of severity of viral pneumonies can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary acid, pneumocytical hyperplase, atypical pneumocity isus, interstitial inflammation with lymfocytary infiltration and multinucleated genetic cells
Severe pneumonia: different alveolary damage (DAD) with diffus alveolary exhausteds.
DAD is the cause of the acid respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
Pneumonia in the course of health: organisation of exhausted in alveolary cavitates and interstitial pulmonary fibrose
Sang : diseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD) ; leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risks of infection include residing in themselves, avoiding bonded places, often laying hands in water and sugar for at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with non-slaved hands.
The CDC recommends to cover the mouth and nose with a mouth when it is all or external and to use the inside of the cow in the mixture.
A correct hygiene of the hands after having been cut or extracted is recommended.
The CDC recommended to cover the face with a tissue in public places to limit transmission in cases of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategy aims to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by shutting schools and jobs, reducing movements and cancelling the major groups of people.
Distance Directives also include the respect of a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no drug known to be effective in the prevention of the COVID-19. Since a vaccine has not been expected before 2021 to earlier, a key element of the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic, which is also called "plate the corbe".
The CDC also recommends individuals to lay hands often in the sun and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they were at the toilet or when the hands are salted; before they eat; and after they were mocked, seated, or expelled.
In addition, it recommends to use a desinfecting solution for alcohol based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only if water and science are not available. For areas where deinfectants for trade hands are not available, the WHO offers two forms for local production.
In these forms, the antimicrobian activity comes from etha or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate the sterile spores in alcohol, which is "not an antiseptic active substance for hands".
Glycerol is used as humid.
Persons are treated by support care that may include hydrological treatment, oxygenotherapy and support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that a simple face mask of people who are suspicious of being portrayed by the virus.
Extracorporal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) was used to treat the cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a way of life and healthy food were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful for those who have moderate symptoms in the previous stage of infection. The WHO and the National Health Committee have made recommendations for the care of hospitalized persons for the COVID-19.
Reanimators and pneumologists in the United States collected therapeutic recommendations issued by several agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
In April 2020 there is no specific treatment of the COVID-19.
In relation to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetamine) rather than ibuprofene in the first line.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of virus, especially under care conditions when the implementation of procedures may generate airosols, such as inrubing or manual ventilation.
For health professionals who are subject to COVID-19, the CDC recommends to place the person in a isolation room adapted to air infection (AIIR) by using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions relating to air transport. The CDC highlights Directives relating to the use of individual protection equipment (EPI) during the pandemy.
The recommended equipment is: blue PPE, respiratory or face mask, oculary protection and medical walls. If available, it is the privilege of respiratory masks (in face masks).
N95 respiratory masks are approved in industrial conditions, but the FDA has allowed the use of these masks in accordance with an engine use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect air particulates such as powder, but their efficiency against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for non-specific uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use face protection screens, or in the last resource, artisanal masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not sufficiently serious to need mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of the east.
The type of respiratory assistance for people who suffer from respiratory disorders related to COVID-19 is currently studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that inbuction can be avoided using a high-depth nausea canel or a positive pressure of dual-level respiratory paths.
We are ignored if one of the two or both produces the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technology limits the diffusion of aerosol particulates compared to a high-depth nausea canal. Severe cases are more frequent in adults (the more than 60 years old, especially those of more than 80 years).
Many developed countries have not enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a little soon of the number of cases of COVID-19 to need hospitalisation.
A Chinese study showed that 5% of the cases were admitted in intensive care, 2,3% needed respiratory assistance and 1,4% were dead.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally accepted in intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of the acid respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and high EP are necessary to optimize oxygen release and minimise the risk of pulmonary lesion associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High EEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The research of potential treatments starting in January 2020 and several antiviral medicines are subject to clinical tests.
The remdesivir is the most promising.
Although new medicines may not be developed before 2021, several testing medicines are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tested in patients suffering from a serious disease.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in tests on efficiency and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to the plasma of convalents as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It was not subject to clinical tests necessary to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness for disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage epidemic.
Users are requested to enter their name and a identificator.
The application is able to detect "nearly contacts" using monitoring data and thus detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user may also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application is not only recommended by the autoquarters, it also warns local health authorities. The analysis of the massive data from mobile phone data, face ability, mobile phone location and artificial intellectuality is used to locate infected people and those with whom they were contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people who had the coronavirus.
The measure was intended to respect the quarantine and protect those who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared appealed phone location data with the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyze and prevent virus propagation.
Russia has deployed the face-only ability to detect people who do not respect the quarantine.
In Italy, the Regional Ministry of Health Giulio Gallera has been informed by mobile telephone operators that "40% of people continue to move."
The German Government has held 48 hours a week-end of Hakathon with more than 42.000 participants.
The Estonian President, Kersti Kaljulaid, launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the propagation of the coronavirus.
Persons may suffer from 40%, move restrictions, secondary effects of treatment or fear of self-infection.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor statement: "August social isolation, singleness, health concern, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail for mental health and people's welfare."
The disease may have a moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, similar to other common diseases of respiratory ways like the fume.
Moderated cases are generally repeated in two weeks, while serious or critical cases need three to six weeks.
In some cases, COVID-19 may affect poultry and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely touched cases, COVID-19 can quickly progress to develop to a acue respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) caused respiratory disorder, sectical choc or multivisceral deficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sexicemia, coagulation disorders and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, particularly an increase in prothrombine time, have been described at 6% of the cases hospitalized with COVID-19, and a renal insufficiency is observed in 4% of those in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of COVID-19 people have high hepatic enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, including five past hospitalization.
However, patients with intensive care had a average period of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of previous cases, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total beach comprised between six and 41 days.
In a study of the National Committee on China Health (NHC), men had a 2.5% mortality rates of 2,8% while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
The histopathological examinations of post-mortal pulmonary samples have a diffused alveolary damage with fibromyxoid cell exhibitions in both powder.
Viral cytopatic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the powder reversed to a aige respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11,8% of the deaths reported by the National Chinese Health Committee, heart lesions due to high tropone rates or to a cardiac detention have been observed.
According to march data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had pre-existent pathologies; the ability of medical resources and the socio-economic conditions of a region may also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the rate of mortality of the disease are different from these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The subnumber of moderate cases may result in a supervaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is under-estimated.
The smokers were 1,4 times more inclinated to develop serious symptoms of the COVID-19 and have a 2.5 times higher risk of going in intensive care or killing in comparison to non-fluorers. Inquiries also appear in comparison with long-term disease sequences.
Hong Kong's hospital administration observed a loss of 20% to 30% of the respiratory capacity in certain healthy people, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This may also lead to an intensive post care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was ignored whether an earlier infection had a long-term immunity in health careers.
Immunity is considered as fair, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but cases of healthy persons from the COVID-19 followed by positive tests to coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered as an increase in a late infection rather than as a reinfection.
The virus is natural and animal origin, by propagation of infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the propagation of the infection was almost only conducted by a human transmission.
A study of 41 first confirmed cases from COVID-19 in January 2020 in The Lancet showed that the oldest date of appearance of symptoms came up to 1 December 2019.
Official publications of the WHO indicated the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are usually used to evaluate mortality.
These figures are different from the regions and in time, and are affected by the volume of tests, quality of health system, therapeutic options, the time spent from the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
End 2019, the WHO affected the CIM-10 U07.1 pathological emergency codes for the deaths confirmed in laboratorium of the infection in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for the deaths of COVID-19 of a clinical or epidemiological viewpoint without infection in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in laboratorium. The dead report reflects the number of deaths divised by the number of cases in a given period of time.
According to the statistics of the University of Johns-Hopkins, the dead/governmental report is 6,9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the Letality rate (CFR) that reflect the percentage of individuals who determine illness and illness rate (IRF) that reflect the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not) who determine a disease.
These statistics are not limited at the time and follow a particular population of contamination in the course of the disease.
Although all infected people do not develop anticorps, the presence of anticorps may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicent of the epidemic in Italy, Castiglione of Adda, a small village of 4 600 people, 80 of them (1,7%) have already been killed.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through festivals, and young people, generating relatively low mortality rates, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overcome.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have anti-corps, an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as linked to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemy and the mortality rate is different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest in the fifty-year men, the difference between men and women that disappear at only 90 years.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women.
The precise reasons for this difference between sexes are unknown, but genetic and behavior factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences; sex, the lower prevalence of tobacco in women and the development in humans of comerbidities, such as hypertension at a less advanced age than women could have contributed to a higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected persons were men and 72 per cent of the dead persons of COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the American Government does not collect the data associated with the type of infections to the COVID-19.
Studies showed that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS are different to men and women.
A higher percentage of health staff, in particular the employee, are women and have a increased risk of being exposed to virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be COVID-19.
The Director-General of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 is the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical place (e.g. China), a species of animals or a group of persons, to international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatisation. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acid respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in its communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly called "coronavirus".
The initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended to use provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acid respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease, in the Directive of 2015 against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were addressed on 11 February 2020.
With regard to the ability limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care material such as ecovils and respirator parts.
For example, when a Italian hospital needed an emergency breach and that the supplier could not provide it in a voluntary time, a local startup restored and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, complexist theories, false information and discovery have been reported on origin, extension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of disease and have rapidly been distributed online.
It is that man is able to propagate disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been found for viral replication evidence in sugars, canards and poultry.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY test" to evaluate therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral components with the most promising efficiency.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are currently developing vaccine candidates.
Previous travels on the SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both using the ACE 2 recipient to pass into hum's cells.
Three vaccination strategies are subject to research.
Firstly, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a quick human body immune response in case of new infection to COVID-19.
A second strategy, sub-unity-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that implies the immune system for certain virus sub- units.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research are related to S-speculary protein that helps the virus to infiltre in the ACE enzyme recipient 2.
A third strategy is the one of nuclear acid vaccines (va’nation by DNA or ARN, a new vaccination creation technique).
On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inoffensive genetic code copied on the virus that causes disease. The dependent activation of anticorps has been suggested as a possible challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversed.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests are current.
Seven tests have evaluated treatments already approved against paludism, including four studies on hydroxychlorokine or chlorokine.
Reversible antiviral medicines constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials of phase III on remdesivir in several countries where reports are expected finally.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 was also placed in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicines are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdezivir, chlorokine and hydrochlorokine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Temporary data suggest the effectiveness of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with remdesivir with compassionate use.
In the United States, China and Italy, clinical trials of Phase III are being studied. The chlorokine, used previously to monitor the paludism, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, some request an independent analysis of research travels.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chlorokine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the double of this dose is highly dangerous and may be deathal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychlorokin and chlorokin in accordance with the authorisation of urgence use for medical discrimination with COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of Chinese directives includes interferon, ribavirin or humifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the follow-up of an in vivo study after showing a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies showed that the initial spike protein starts with the serial transmembran protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the input of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE 2.
Studies on chlorokine and hydrochlorokine with or without asythromycin have major limits that prevented the medical community to adopt these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic choc may be a complication at the following stages of COVID-19 severe.
There are evidences indicating that hydroxychlorokine can have cytokinic antichoc properties. Tocilizumab was included in the Treatment Directives by the Chinese National Health Committee after a small study.
Phase 2 tests are not randomized at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people who have a severe form of disease.
Associated with a series of ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic choc, it must oppose such evolutions that are suspicioned to be the origin of the death of certain touched persons.
Antagonist of interleukine-6 recipient was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the refractional cyclokin relief syndrome to the steroids produced by a different cause, the treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
Today, there is no randomised and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is a effective treatment of the SCR.
Transfer of cleaned and cleaned anticorps produced by the immune systems of people who have cured COVID-19 to those who need it is to study as non- vaccinal method of passive immunisation.
This strategy was tested for the SRAS with no conclusions.
Viral neutralisation is the expected method of action through which anticorps-based treatment can generate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell cyclotoxicity depending on anticorps and/or phagocytose can be possible.
Other forms of antibiotic treatment, such as using monoclonal anticorps, are developing.
The production of serum of convalent persons, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of health patients and containing specific anticorps against this virus, could be increased for a faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of extremely apparent syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after he took attention to the propagation of the virus.
