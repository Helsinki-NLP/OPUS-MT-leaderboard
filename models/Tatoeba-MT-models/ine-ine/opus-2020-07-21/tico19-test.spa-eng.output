Accumulated incidence in rapid increase of the disease by coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The accumulation of cases of disease by coronavirus (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although in different stages the country is, the COVID-19 pandemy is quickly progressing in all countries.
On the basis of Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a COVID-19 patients who will need medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown ethological neumony in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Control and Prevention of Chinees reported that the caused agent was a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of hard respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence at the date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a light disease, such as an infection of respiratory traction with or without neumony, and that most are recovered.
In 14% of the cases, COVID-19 develops a severe disease than hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a critical disease that reacts to intensive care.
The mortality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is of 4 %.
In this study, we examine the trends in the accumulation of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EE) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compare them to the Province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EE countries and the RU with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EE and RU countries
After China, the COVID-19 continued to be geographically propagated and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemy in the rest of the world is currently followed by this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemy.
In the e-5 March of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. informed the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the definition of the WHO case.
In the EU/EE, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in the 30 EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (RU), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date included, were recorded 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths, 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths only in Italy.
Obtainment of the accumulated amount and accumulation of cases of COVID-19
In the European Control and Prevention Centre (ECDC), the COVID-19 cases reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to examine the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EE and the RU and to compare them with Italy.
As indicator of the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we calculate the accumulation of cases of COVID-19 trumpet to 14 days; thus we took into account the natural course of the COVID-19, in each EU/EEE and the RU countries during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the collected number of cases reported in each country to the 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m., compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 tendances in EU/EEE countries and RU
The trends in the accumulated ability of cases of COVID-19 trend to 14 days in the EU/EEA countries and the RU, in general, followed the Province of Hubei (China) (figure 1).
In the EU/EEE and the RU in general, the collected ability of the COVID-19 eats to increase around 21 February and then increased consideration by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was primarily due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the RU have shown increased trends of the compulsory COVID-19 similar (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the collected amount of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It stresses that, on 15 March to 8:00 p.m., 15 other 15 EU/EEA countries and the RU have already registered a total of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 reported cases is rapidly increased in the EU/EE and the RU.
The trends observed in the accumulated ability of the COVID-19 suggest that pandemy is going to a similar rate in all countries.
This is so, despite the different stages in which countries, changes in national public health responses and, possibly, different definitions of case in countries and different protocols to select patients who should be subject to the test to confirming the COVID-19, including the deteriorated tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors of the Italian regions described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already achieved their maximum capacity.
Data on case admissions of COVID-19 in a hospital or intensive care unit are available at EU/EEE level for only 6 % and 1 % of the cases respectively (no data are shown).
However, systemically should be collected to comply with the current monitoring data focused on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a great change in the intensive and intermediate care beds in Europe, which was 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds every 100.000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds every 100 000 people in 2010-11).
Model scenarios relating to the saturation of medical attention capacity, calculating for each EU/EEE countries and the RU prevalence of hospitalization cases associated with a risk of > 90 % over the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid evaluation of the ECDC risk on COVID-19.
Since at the present cases have been conglomerated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the RU countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally affect a defined regional captation population, information on cases and stages of intensive care should be provided at the level of statistical territorial unit nomenclature 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemy is rapidly progressing in the EU/EEE and the RU.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who react to medical attention and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the regions affected by Italy.
As indicated in the rapid evaluation of the ECDC risk, it is essential to adopt a quick, proactive and integral approach to suspend the SARS-CoV-2 propagation, with a change in content approach to a mixture, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to the responsible for decisions and hospitals to understand, accept and adjust their response in a way agreed if it is not implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also highlights the necessary public health measures to reduce the impact of pandemy.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to deepen their control efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 propagation and to reduce the health system pressure.
If this is not done, the health systems of other EU/EE countries are to be held to one of patients who are intensively careful in the next days and weeks.
The broadcast of disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 tough respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has even caused the death of 3000 people and has infected more than 80 000 in China and in other parts of the world, which generated a disaster for humans.
As similar to its homologic virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the muscle and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a severity and mortality less than the SARS, but it is much more transmissible and more affecting older people than young and more men than women.
In response to the increased number of publications on emergency disease, the purpose of this article is to provide an appropriate and full analysis of the research issue, which is quickly developed.
We will treat the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, predictation and prevention of disease.
Although many questions have no answer yet, we hope that this analysis helps to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Primavera Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unusual and immortal memory for all Chinese, who have encouraged them to stay home during the whole festivity and for several weeks more due to the break of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (OMS) called him SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called a disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic eats in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread throughout the country and almost 50 countries more than all over the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus caused more than 80 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40 000 high and more than 3000 defected patients.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number" and that is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
Pursuant to PubMed (https://www.iscebi.nlm.ni.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 Scientific articles on the COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnostic and treatment have been published since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to summarize progress in research on this new matter quickly developed.
When possible, we will compare COVID-19 with the SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a brot in 2012).
We will also examine what is known until the time of prevention and prevention of disease, as well as some decisional questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronavirus has traditionally been considered non-local patogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common refrigered 4.
However, in this century, we have found two times with highly pathogen coronavirus in humans, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused a brot in China, 2003, and Saudi Arabia, respectively, in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with a terrible mortality and mortality.
Therefore, the current broad of COVID-19 is the third per coronavirus of which is registered in the history of mankind.
As shown in Fig. Fig. 1.1, conglomerated of unknown origin neumony, the first time Wuhan was reported to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, he was given to know the sequence of the coronavirus.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, epidemia was rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was informed, which suggested that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was put in quarter and all public transports were suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seamark that was considered the site of origin of the infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared to the break a world healthy event.
At the date of this report, the disease has already been propagated throughout China and almost 50 countries over the world (fig. 2).
Since the situation is quickly evoluted, the final dimension and severity of the broad still cannot be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentric study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, presented a more updated illustration of the epidemie described hereafter (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 was infected by people of all age, but mainly for people of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people had more than 50 years, very few were less than 20 and only 14 infectioned were less than 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 was more infected by men (0.31/100 000) than for women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was expanded in conglomerated mostly in Hubei and its areas.
In average, 5 days (of 2 to 9) between the appearance and the diagnosis of the COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days ( between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days ( between 4.8 and 13.)
The basic playing number (R0) was 3.77 (IC 95 %: 3.51-4.05) and the R0 adjusted was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exposedly before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to the time of massive mobilization before the Primavera Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 % (IC 95 %: 1.10-1.86 %) and the adjusted mortality of the total patients was 3.06 % (IC 95 %: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (maculin), age (≥60) and serious neumonia.
Coronavirus are a large and enveloped virus subfamily containing a unique ARN.
They can be divided into four genes, such as alfa, beta, gamma and delta, from which alfacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those who infect humans.
Involution glicoprotein (S) is one to its cell recipients, angiotensin 2 (ACE2) convert enzyme and peptidyl dipeptidazole 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then the membrane fussion is produced.
Viral ARN genema is released to citoplasma; then from the replication of the viral gene, the genomic ARN, together with the involution glicoprotein and the nucleocapside protein, forms of vesicculous forms containing virons, which then combine with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered as a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99,98 % in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the broadband: the market of Huan's marines of Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With a electronic transmission microscope, parts of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultradeveloped sections of human respiratory epitele.
Human ACE2 was determined as a SARS-CoV-2 recipient, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S is the human ACE2 weakest than SARS-CoV, which is congruent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could have a function in the viral patogenicity and inhibit the IFNv expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional reason or domination.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the Electronic Cryomicroscopy of the ACE2 full-length human resolution 2.9 Å, completely with the Aminoacide transporter B0AT.
They discovered that the completion, which had open and closed conformities, was seemed as a diger, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 completion could join two proteins S, which provides evidence for the recognition and effect of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could be converted into a therapeutic dina for the study of medicines to remove the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
Origin and Middle Gas
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were originated in murderers and transferred to humans through civics and camels respectively.
In a philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, the muscle was considered the native gateway of the SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical to 96% to two coronavirus similar to the SARS of murcelague called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still not known what intermediate guest helped the virus to cross the barrier of the species to infect humans, and remains to diluite the transmission path.
Ji, et al., proposed the serpents as ports of the virus of murderers to humans, which involved homologic recombination within the protein S.
In accordance with a study, Guangzhou researchers, China, suggested that pangolines (long hot-hoc maps that are feeding of hormigues and are used in Chinese traditional medicines) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a genetic approval of 99% in a coronavirus of pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % propagated by the total of two genes is still a great difference; there are concluding results that result in concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physical chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a 40-50 % humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; heat, ethanol at 75 %, a chloride deinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other grass solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective to enable virus.
All human populations generally do not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and, on the other hand, it is possible to the new coronavirus.
Until the present, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only review previous studies with other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
Generally, after the virus is invaded to the hospital, it is first recognised by the inhibited immune system of the guest to ≥ patron recognition recipients (PRR), including lectines type C, Toll (TLR), NOD (NLR) recipients and RIG-I recipients (RLR).
In various ways, the virus introduces the expression of inflamator factors, dentritic cell maturation and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferons that limit the propagation of the virus and accelerate the macrofagic fagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help virus escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is to the fight against the virus.
T linfocites, including T CD4+ and CD8+, fill a significant function in defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate the B cells to produce specific anticorps for the virus, and T CD8+ cells just kill the infected cells with the virus.
T cells cooperate produce proinflamatory citocins to help defensor cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of the T cells by inducing the apoptosis of the T cells.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements such as C3a and C5a and anticorps, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated anticorps of a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a excessive reaction from the immune system generates locally a large number of free radicals that may cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst of cases, multiorganic failure and even death.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2, characterised by the appearance in conglomerated, is more likely to affect older people with pregnancy and pregnancy.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large quantity of virus or whose immune functions are committed have a greater probability of infection than others.
The average estimated average of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is from 1 to 14 days, more than 3 to 7 days, in accordance with the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days in average and waste from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described earlier, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days ( 3.0 to 7.2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time depending on the more precise incubation period; this is the way that asymptomatic infections will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As normal practice, persons exposed to virus or infected normally should remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever seems to be the main and initial symptom of the COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptoms or other symptoms such as thickness, disnea, muscle pain, hair pain, head pain, hot pain, remorse, breast pain, diarree, nausea and vomits.
Some patients had disnea or hypoxemy one week after the disease appearance.
In serious cases, patients developed quickly until developing acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metaetic acidis and coagulopatia.
Patients with respiratory or aggressive symptoms, even without pulmonary anomalies in image studies, should be tested by virus for a temperamental diagnostic.
A demographic study of the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for five, 76% for sugar, 55% for diarree and 3% for diarrhee; 8% of patients would need respiratory assistance.
Similar halogens were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by transmission of a asintomatic person.
In comparative manner, a demographic study of 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV had also fibre (98%), sugar (47%) and disnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them would need respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in consequence of the greatest letality of MERS in relation to COVID-19.
Diarree (26 %) and heat pain (21 %) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), sucking (29-75%), diarrhee (40-42%), diarree (20-25%) and heat pain (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance needed at approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
For 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2 % when the confirmed cases reached 66 576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10 % in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study of June 2012, the mortality was 37 % in 2494 confirmed.
In a previous study, R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high and increased to 6.47 with a confidence range (IC) of 95 % from 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.
The numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its letality is less than one of these two last.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemie than the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV.
Appearance in conglomerated seems to occur within the same family or from the same own or vehicle, as a cross.
Patients are expected to have previous travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected or patients in the two weeks before appearance.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients with higher hospital data can reverse the virus, signal of alarm that the time of quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced quantity of white blood in peripheric blood (specially linfocites) in the temperament phase.
For example, linfopenia was observed with a content of white globules of <4x109/l, including a content of linfocides of < 1x109/l, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The hectac and muscle enzymes and myglobin levels were high in the blood of some patients, and reactive protein C and erythrocytic sedimentation were high in the blood of most of the patients.
In patients with serious cases, the diger-D level, a product of degradation of the fibre present in the blood was high, and the content of linfocides was progressively reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the toracic radiographics of most patients with COVID-19, characterised by shadows or bilateral-smerilated glass opacity in lungs.
Patients are planning to develop athic neumonia, an aggressive pulmonary lease and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA is produced, discontrolled inflammation, liquid cumulation and progressive fibrosis are seriously affecting gas exchange.
The disfunction of type I and type II nemotives reduces the surface level and increases superficial pressure, which reduces pulmonal capacity to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary colapse.
Thus, the worst findings in the toracic radiographics are likely to be parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the decline of neumotites, the formation of a hyalina membrane and infiltration of linfocites in interstition, and multinucleated sync cells in the lungs of a patient who died due to disease, which is coincident with the pathology of a viral and SDRA infection and similar to the patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RN through a chain of polymerase with inverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for the diagnostic of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative rate, which could accelerate epidemia, the clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (not already based on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of the SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease preliminary, clinical manifestations, radiologic tests and detections is essential and impersive for effective diagnostics.
On 14 February 2020, the group Feng Zhang described a SHEROLOCK technology application protocol based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects the synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a range graduated in less than one hour that does not react full instruments.
Happy, the new technology can drasticly increase sensitivity and conviction if it is checked in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can mostly take care of support for patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These treatments include currently or potential treatments with antiviral medicinal products, immunosuppressors,steroids, recovered patients plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It is recommended to use the plasma of patients recovered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly attacking the pulmones at the beginning and, probably, also attacks, in a smaller degree, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the digestive equipment and the nine.
However, respiratory disfunction and insuficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is critical to alive symptoms and save life, including general oxygenotherapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation in accordance with the severity of the disease.
Patients with serious respiratory symptoms need oxygenation by extracorporal membrane (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technology used for the treatment of potentially mortal cardiac or respiratory insuficiences.
Furthermore, the maintenance of electronic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vitale organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that citokinestorm is the result of a excessive reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Citokinstorm is a form of systemic inflamatory response characterized by the release of a series of citocines, including TNFa, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNb, IFNb, IFNg and MCP-1.
These citizens introduce immune cells to liberate a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multiorganic failure.
Immunosupression is essential for the treatment of cito torments, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab have been used, an anti-receptor monoclone anticorps of IL6 to treat the cito storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cito storm are the modulation of the immune response directed by cells T; IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; a supplier of the way 4 of cito-signalisation, and HDAC inhibitors.
Esteroids, such as immunosuppressors, were largely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of the inflamator damage.
However, high-dose sterories were not beneficial for serious pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
However, serious secondary effects, particularly osteonecrosis, may cause serious adverse effects, which affect the note predict.
However, the use of corticosteroids was recommended in moderate moderate doses during a short period for patients with COVID-19 in critical state.
At the date of this analysis, the effectiveness of any antiviral treatment has not been confirmed.
However, the efficiency of remdesivir, a nuclear analog, has been checked intravenously in a patient and with COVID-19.
The remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also showed the potential to inhibit other virus with monocatenary ARN, such as MERS and SARS virus.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the composite to China to carry out a few tests in infected persons with SARS-CoV-2, and there is a great expectation for the results.
Moreover, baricitinib, alfa interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as possible treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarree, nausea, vomit, hepatic damage and other adverse reactions may occur after the combination of therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medicines used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma of recovered patients and anticorps generation
The extraction of blood from patients who have been recovered from a concomitant disease to treat other patients who have opposed the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not face disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients are expected to have a high level of antibodies against the pathogen in blood.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by linfocites B to combat patogens and other strange objects, and recognize certain moles in patogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, the plasma was extracted from blood from a group of patients recovered from COVID-19 and was injected to 10 seriously.
Its symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction of the inflamation and viral loads and a better oxygen saturation in blood.
However, it is necessary to check and explain this to propose the method for its use at a large scale until specific terapies are developed.
Furthermore, therapeutic effects should be considered to be determined.
For example, anticorps can stimulate immunity response and cause citocin freedom syndrome, which may produce mortal toxicity.
The anticorps concentration in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical state.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific anticorps with sufficient speed to combat global pandemy.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells of the recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encoding effective anticorps or seek effective anticorps against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of anticorps.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects in large measure of a combination of several components in a form that varied was the diagnosis of a disease in accordance with MCT theories.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or are insufficient, since it is difficult to extract and check such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, the MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with moderate height symptoms or for those who have been recovered from serious stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du's capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen's capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in various provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Province of Hubei, which used the MCT in only 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lower recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a very adverse comparison, since many other effect factors, such as the quantity and seriousness of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and its colleagues published a study in which western treatment (MO) was compared only with the combination of MO and MCT treatment.
They discovered that the times necessary for recovery of body temperature, discharge of symptoms and hospitalization were not less in the MO+MCT group than only in the MO group.
What is most surprising, the rate of symptoms decreasing (from lower to serious) was note less in the MO+MCT group than only in the MO group (7.4 % above 46.2 %) and the mortality was less in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group (8.8 % to 39 %).
However, MCT efficiency and safety continue to wait for more well-controlled tests at higher scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to determine the effective components of the MCT treatments or its combinations as possible.
Patients with suspicious or confirmation of COVID-19 generally have a lot of fear of illness extremely contagious and even mortal, and Quarentene people also experience disappointment, singleness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of the infection as fever, hypoxie and tos, as well as the adverse effects of treatment, such as the insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental anxiety.
At the early phase of the SARS broadcast, a series of psychiatric mortalities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirio and even suicide trends were reported.
The trace of contacts and the mandatory quarter, as part of public health responses to COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty for the effects of the county, the quarantine and the stage in their families and friends.
Hence, it should be given attention to mental health to patients with COVID-19, those with suspiciousness and those who are in contact with them, as well as the general public you need.
Psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary mental health equipment, clear communications with regular and precise updates on SARS-CoV-2 broadcasting and treatment plans and use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Essential vaccines are essential to interrupte the transmission chain of animal and human reserves infected to potential guests, and are added to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemies caused by emergency virus.
The efforts were made to develop vaccines based on protein S to generate potential neutralizing anticorps and long-term or immunity protecting SARS-CoV.
Vacunas with living viruses in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the in vivo efficiency of these possible vaccines in elderly people and letal stimulation models and their protection against the infection by zoonotic virus should still be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to the SARS extinguishing 17 years ago and no new case has been registered since that time.
However, there are cases and conglomerates of MERS in the Middle East that are propagated to other regions due to the sustainability of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategy for MERS has been developed using active virus, DNA plasmates, viral vectors, nanoparticules, particulates similar to virus and recombinant protein sub-unities, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity people is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemy.
However, it is difficult to overcome difficulties due to the long period (18 months in average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and for the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 recently started to demonstrate its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually be recovered without breakfast.
However, as the SARS and MERS occur, COVID-19 is also associated with high mortality and mortality in patients with serious cases.
Therefore, the establishment of a predict for disease is essential in order to prioritize health agencies, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported until now, the following factors may affect or be associated with the predict of patients with COVID-19 (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the SARS predict, which also results accurate for COVID-19.
The COVID-19 was greater than 30-65 years old and 47.7% of those patients had more than 50 years in a study of 8866 cases, as described earlier.
Patients needing intensive care with higher probability had subyacent food and complications and were considered greater than those who did not require them (in age of 66 to 51), which suggests that age is a predictable factor of the development of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 before 0.27/100 000), as described earlier.
Comfortability and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who reject intensive care with greater probability suffer from a heavy and arithmical heart failure.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can also be associated with positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause heetic disfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It is necessary to stress that the age and subjacent diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere between themselves.
Anormal results: Reactive protein C (PCR) in the blood reflects the seriousness of the inflamation or weight loss and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, the response to therapy and final recovery.
The coordination between the level of PCR and the seriousness and the predict of the COVID-19 has also been proposed.
Moreover, a high level of deshidrogenase lactate, aminotransferase aspartate (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and cinase creatinine (CK) can also help to predict the development of the patient.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in various organs, especially the heart and the hygiene, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
In addition, they constitute traditional brands of heart or hectic disfunctions.
Principal clinical symptoms: Torax radiography and temporary progress of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for the predictation of clinical disconnections and complications of COVID-19.
Usage of steroids: as described earlier, the steroids are immunosuppressors that are usually used as adequate treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of the inflamator damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were extended in patients with serious SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrose with permanent incapacity and bad life quality.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described earlier, during COVID-19, many patients have suffered an extraordinary stress, since in general, they have endured long periods in quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and have assisted the death of neighbors and other patients.
It is indispensable to breathe psychotherapy and long-term support for these patients to help them recover from the stress and return to their normal life.
In accordance with the demographic studies done to the present, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than the SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory ways, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated in higher respiratory ways and caused weight symptoms or not cause symptoms in the early phase of the infection, as is happening with other coronavirus that cause common refrigeration.
Therefore, patients infected in early phases or incubation periods may produce a large quantity of virus during their daily activities, which is extremely difficult for epidemic control.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was considered when patients were serious, while the transmission was mostly not at the early phase.
In addition, the current COVID-19 break is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS broad.
Great efforts are currently made in China, including the closure of Wuhan and the cities of the surroundings and the continued quarterine of almost all the population with the hope of interrupting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures come to generate a significant damage in the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the desaceleration of epidemia.
The most optimistic prevision is made, the brot will be concluded for March and the descending stage will take 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., believed that COVID-19, which seems to be considered more infectious than the SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasal and pharmaceutical exhibitions in patients who had been recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, which indicates that the recently identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to the influenza.
However, signs have been seen promises in China due to reduction in the number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategies could be working.
Originally it was predicted that the ebola would cause up to a million cases with a half million deaths.
However, by means of a strict square and a strict isolation, the disease has been controlled.
As SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may be debilited in terms of infection and finally extinguishes or becomes a less patogenous virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS is followed (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible to the toys or horn, and may also to the direct contact with virus contaminated materials.
The virus was also detected in the processes, which provides a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases may have been caused by infections in noocomies, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Therefore, care should be taken to protect humans, especially medical care providers, social workers, families, colleagues, and even transactions in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first defense line that could be used to reduce the infection risk is the use of maskers; the use of chirurgical and maskery maskers with N95 respirator (serial number 1860) helps control the propagation of virus.
Chirurgic maskers imped that potentially infected person's liquid gotics be transmitted by the air or attached to the surfaces, from where they could be transferred to other persons.
However, only N95 maskers (series number 1860) can protect from the inhalation of so small virgins as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5 % of the virgins can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both dimensions around 85 nm.
Since particulates can penetrate up to five pilled chirurgical maskers, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 maskers (serial number 1860) and not chirurgical maskers.
Besides the maskers, medical care providers must use isolation bats in order to reduce the contact with the virus.
Virus can also infect a person with the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, despite having used a N95 mask; it is possible that the virus has entered into its body to its flamming eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use protectors or transparency hairs while working with patients.
For the public in general of affected or potentially affected areas, the population is carefully suggested to laugh the hands with defective jabons as follows of the habit, while staying in a voluntary quarter and limiting contact with persons who may be infected.
Three feet are considered a suitable distance to keep people away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and avoid the propagation of virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for human world, its high approval with SARS-CoV, was informed on 7 January 2020, it should have caused great warning in China for its experience with the SARS broadcast in 2003.
However, it was not only until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Centre for the Control of the Sickness of Wuhan tranquili to the citizens saying that the new virus had a low counterparty and a limited reproduction capacity between humans, and that there would be no problems to prevent and contain disease.
This message refused to note the public alarm, especially at a moment when the whole country was prepared for the Prime Party, and the critical time was deployed to keep disease at the minimum level in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should take this hard lesson and make decisional improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public announcements, since each word is important for citizens and can make changes of their or their decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to inu information of clinics, rather than waiting for the formal reports of doctors or officers; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in their early phase, rather than to relax the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted simulators and effectiveness to enhance public consciousness of epidemic diseases and testing and improving the system of response of society periodically.
The COVID-19 fraction caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus eats to the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has been propagated throughout China and about 50 countries more than all over the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of the COVID-19 and the SARS, the COVID-19 brot has generated the feeling of the SARS reapparition.
However, there are some notorial differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain epidemia and treat patients.
COVID-19 more affects older people than young and more men than women, and seriousness and mortality are also greater in age people than in young people.
SARS has a more mortality than COVID-19 (10,91 % to 1,44 %).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus although they do not present symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do it when they are seriously, which makes a much greater difficulty to contain the COVID-19 propagation compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 was far more rapid and generalized than SARS-CoV.
The regular ARN test for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients can give a positive in the virus again.
These results are drasticly increased by the risk that the virus is propagated.
In view of the so quick progress in the COVID-19 research, several important issues are resolved, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 get out?
Although there was 96 % of genetic approval between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronavirus of muscles similar to SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates from the murcers.
What animal was the middle species that transmitted the virus of the original gas, let's say, the murderers, to humans?
Without aware of the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to break the transmission in a way of shape, and the break can be resurrected at any time.
Although molecular modeled and biochemical tests have proved that SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2, how exactly the virus comes into the cells of the respiratory ways and causes later pathological changes?
Is the virus also one to the cells expressing the ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve rapid and precise diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemie take?
How does the virus evolute genetically when it is transferred between humans?
Will he become a global pandemy, extinguish it as the SARS or periodically resurrect as the gripe?
Although it can take some time, it is essential to find answers to these questions and to many others.
However, it costs what it costs, we have no more option than to stop epidemia as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zonotic sources of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronavirus and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
By 2003, two human coronavirus caused weak diseases, such as common refrigeration.
Heavy respiratory syndrome breaks (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have invested the currency in discovering how devastate and mortal human coronavirus may be.
The surgery of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China for the end of 2019 placed the coronavirus in the centre of attention again and surprised us with a high transmissionability and a reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
The infection by human coronavirus is a zoonosis and we would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
Most human coronavirus have their origin in the murderers, in which they are not patogens.
The intermediate reserve guests of some human coronavirus are also known.
The definition of animal guests has direct implications in preventing human diseases.
Investing interactions between coronavirus and guests in animals can also broke important information on the patogenicity of coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge of the seven coronavirus of humans, with emphasis in the history of their discovery, as well as in their zoonotic origins and in the transmission of species.
Note, we compare and contrast the different human coronavirus from the perspective of the development of the virus and the recombination of the gene.
The current disease epidemie by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
Moreover, the requirements for successful gas changes and the implications of the development of virus in the disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a positive monocatenary ARN virus group with involution.
These viruses, which enjoy the largest gene, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the ARN viruss, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, by the form of coron which are under a electronic microscope.
As regards their →, coronavirus has non-segregated genes that have a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the gene contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into the repplicated polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteines are still processed to generate 16 non-≥16 proteins, named nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the gene contains ORF for proteines, including spig (S), of the envolture (E), of the membrane (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific protein accessories of each line are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
On the basis of the difference in protein sequences, coronavirus is classified in four genes (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, ↓ coronavirus and deltacoronavirus), including the gene of betacoronavirus contains most human coronavirus and is subdivided in four lines (A, B, C and D).
The philogenic evidence has shown that the murcyelags and roeders are the source of genes of most of the alfacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while the birds are the main reserve of the coronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
Thousands of years, coronavirus have constantly crossed the barriers of the species and some have occurred as important human patogens.
By the date, seven coronavirus of humans are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alfacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus of the severe heat respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually causes light symptoms, such as a common frozen or diarrhea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause the lower respiratory pathways to a higher quantity of patients, with a higher probability of developing the aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and extra-pulmonary manifestations.
The first heat of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the narrow secretion of patients with common refrigerated at the middle of the decade of 1960.
Since then, more knowledge has been accompanied with exhaustive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS broadcast, it was a broadly accepted concept that the infection by coronavirus of humans is generally inofensiva.
The SARS broadcast that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastaters of the present history and infected more than 8000 people, with a cruel letality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the breath of respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) placed a persistent epidemic in the Arabic peninsula with spray propagation to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which later was called SARS-CoV-2, is the caused agent of the disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been covered over 3120 lives and has infected more than 91 000 people to 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemy that is close.
The seven coronavirus of humans have a zoonotic origin in murcyelags, ratons or home animals.
Several evidence lines support the evolutional origin of all human coronavirus in the murcyelags, in which viruses are well adapted and are not patogens, but present a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has caused great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Trace the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus is a framework for understanding the natural history, impulsive force and the factors of spring restriction between species.
This could also lead or facilitate the search of the reserve and the intermediate and enhanced animal guests of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications in preventing the promotion in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and human coronavirus patogenia.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parental human coronavirus viruss usually are not patogens in their natural reserve guests, but return patogens after transmission of species to a new guest.
We also examine the tendence of human coronavirus evolution, in which the increase in transmissionality is to lead to the reduction of patogenicity.
The development of the current brake of SARS-CoV-2 is also analysed in this context.
He has knowledge of the coronavirus of animals since the end of the 1930 decade.
Before the first isolation of the BCOV-229E height of the Natal Secretion of patients who had taken a common refrigeration, different coronavirus have been isolated in different infected animals, such as the powder, mouse, vacuum, green, cat and dog.
In the last deces, seven coronavirus of humans have been identified.
A short summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in croological order (table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E seal was isolated from the respiratory paths of patients with infection from the higher respiratory paths in 1966 and then adjusted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the pulmone.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented symptoms of common refrigeration, such as head pain, horn, general disease and fat pain, with fever and tos in 10~20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the body culture and the later severe pass in lactants brains.
The clinical characteristics of the infection by HCoV-OC43 seem to be similar to the caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of the infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as viruses of influenza A and renovirus.
both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed by the world and are tend to be transmitted primarily during the winter station, in template climate.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a disease period of approximately 2 weeks.
In accordance with a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a light common refrigeration.
Only some immunocomprometted patients have presented a serious infection of lower respiratory paths.
The SARS, also known as "atypical neumonia", caused the first pandemy caused by a well-documentated human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the ethological agent is the SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus who was discovered.
The first case of SARS is returned at the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic was 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and was propagated by many countries and continents.
Besides the superprojectors, each case could cause sometimes two secondary cases, with a period of incubation of 4 to 7 days and the apparence of the maximum viral load at the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present mialgia, head pain, fever, general disease and scalophry, followed by disorder, toys and respiratory difficulties as late symptoms.
Linfopenia, changed hectatic function and high level of kinase creatinine are common anormal results in SARS tests.
Difused alveolar damage, proliferation of epitelial cells and increased macrofags are also observed in patients with SARS.
In fact, 20-30% of patients later re-reaged intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
Besides the lower respiratory ways, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, the hygade and the nine, can also be infected in these serious cases, normally accompanied by a citocin torment, which could be mortal, especially in immundepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the pulmonary biopsie to heaven from a family of the initial patient that traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been dedicated to the research of human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was born from a 7-month child from the Netherlands for the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in small children, adults and immunocomprometes with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of core, conjunctivitis, fever and bronquiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nose sample taken from a 8-month child who suffers of neumony in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
It was estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4,7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum ability is at the beginning of soil, primavery and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laringitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with neumony and bronquiolite in Hong Kong.
In addition to neumony and bronquiolite acquisited in the community, it was informed that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with accurate exacerbations of asma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was all over the world and caused heavy respiratory diseases.
These four coronavirus of humans purchased in the community have been well adapted to humans and generally are less intended to move to highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown causes, such as in the short case of a more virual subtype of HCoV-NL63, which recently reported that it has caused serious infection on the lower respiratory ways in China.
Generally, when these human coronavirus add the ability to transmit themselves and keep themselves continually in humans, they also return less virulents or patogens.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient who had developed an aggressive neurological and renal insuficiency in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in § are originating from the Middle East, cases have been registered with occasional account to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary fraction occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS' clinical manifestations are similar to SARS, characterised by progressive aggressive neumony.
In contrast to SARS, many patients with MERS also developed an aggressive renal insufficiency, which until now only is given with MERS among human coronavirus diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarree and vomit.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases were registered, with a high letality of 34.4%, which becomes MERS-CoV as one of the most devastating viruss for people who have knowledge.
Since average to the end of December 2019, conglomerated patients with neumonia in Wuhan, the Province of Hubei, China, who retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the broadcasting of the lower respiratory roads caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also called the COVID-19 disease.
On 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases worldwide were confirmed, with a crushed letality of 3,4 %.
Note, letality in Hubei, China, is 4,2 %, while out of it is 1,2 %.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fibre, toss and disnea.
Diarree has also been observed in some patients.
Neumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop the aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of a high nuclear sequence homologation of 82 %, it is classified in different branches of the philogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less patogenic, but more transmissible in comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asintomatics infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been informed, which could contribute to their rapid propagation throughout the world.
When comparing and contrary to SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronavirus, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
Firstly, the incubation period and the duration of the disease course by human coronavirus are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronavirus.
Secondly, the seriousness of the symptoms of the COVID-19 is situated between the SARS-CoV and the four human coronavirus purchased in the community (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection by SARS-CoV-2 presents characteristics that are more frequently observed in infections by coronavirus of humans obtained in the community, which includes the presentation of non-specific or light symptoms or, even, the lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as the infection by SARS-CoV, although the relationship is a little less.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows characteristic interesting patrons both of human coronavirus purchased in the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least high as the coronavirus of humans purchased in the community.
On the other hand, check if the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced after steps between humans, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fatal samples.
If the SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission fulfils an important role, such as SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it must still be diluted in future studies.
It has also been particularly interested in notifying whether SARS-CoV-2 could demonstrate stability, such as the case of human coronavirus purchased in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmission, patogenicity and sustainable propagation, will affect the final disconnection of the COVID-19 broad.
The four coronavirus of humans purchased in the community that causes light symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both could survive from ancient human coronavirus pandemies.
Coronavirus of humans caused serious diseases in humans and humans who developed serious human coronavirus diseases.
In order to achieve this, human coronavirus should be replied in humans in a sufficient measure to allow the accumulation of adaptative mutations that contrary to the factors of gas restriction.
In this sense, as longer the SARS-CoV-2 breaks and more infected persons, it will be more likely to be completely adjusted to humans.
If it is properly adjusted, it would be difficult to stop its transmission to humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronavirus purchased in the community have been in human populations and have caused common refrigeration in immune people.
These viruses don't need a animal reserve.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission between humans is insufficient.
They need to be maintained and spread in their zoonotic reserves and seek the opportunity to spread to possible human goals, perhaps to one or more intermediate and enhanced guests.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronavirus purchased in the community.
It is highly transmissible as the coronavirus of humans purchased in the community at least for the moment.
However, it is more patogenic than human coronavirus purchased in the community and less patogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether it will be completely adapted to humans and will be among humans without a reserve or intermediate animal guest.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronavirus, we will need to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolution, natural, reserve, media and enhancement of human coronavirus.
A animal acts as a human coronavirus's evolutional guest if he goes to an ancient is relatively related to a higher approval at the level of nuclear sequence.
Ancient virus is normally well adjusted and is not patogenic in this hospital.
Similarly, a reservation guest is a continuous and long-term human coronavirus.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of human coronavirus or their parental virus.
However, if the human coronavirus is introduced in the middle guest just before or almost at the same time of its introduction into humans, it is not well adjusted to the new guest and it seems to be patogenic.
The intermediate guest can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and fulfil the function of enhanced gases by allowing the virus to replique transitorially and then transfer to humans to enhance the scale of human infection.
A human coronavirus may cause an infection on the terminal hospital if it cannot support its transmission in the middle gas.
In contrast, human coronavirus can also be adapted to the intermediate hospital and, even, generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve hospital.
The epidemiological data showed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been contacted with caza animals.
Following seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal tradeers had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Citizens of the masked palms (Paguma larvata) and a dog map in the markets of living animals were the first identified virus-like identifiers like SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was directly supported by the fact that there were no more cases of SARS after killing all market citizens.
However, it was informed that the civics of the wild or non-expositioned palms of live animal markets were more negative in SARS-CoV, which suggests that the masked palms civetes would act as a widespread host, but not as a natural reserve of the SARS-CoV.
Note, since 80 % of the different animals of the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammifers are also acting as an enhancement of the SARS-CoV.
All of them seem to be terminal guests of the SARS-CoV.
The following searches of the natural animal guest of the SARS-CoV discovered a coronavirus of murcyelags is relatively related, named CoV HKU3 Rhinolophus, related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese ferrature murs.
These murderers are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV sequence of genealogies HKU3.
This and other coronavirus of musclelags are a nuclear sequence homologation of 88-92 % with SARS-CoV.
These studies have seen the bases of the new concept that the murderers are located in human pathogens.
Several coronavirus similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in murcyelags, but no one, except a WIV1, can be isolated as living virus.
The conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 (ACE2) human is the SARS-CoV recipient.
It was demonstrated that the WIV1 obtained from a fatal sample of muscles used the ACE2 of murderers, civites and humans as a recipient to enter into cells.
Amazingly, patients with SARS convalents were neutralised by WIV
At the same time, WIV1 represents the most anticipated anticipation of SARS-CoV in murcylags, which is a 95% nuclear sequence homologation.
Despite the high homologation between these two viruses, in general, WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of the SARS-CoV and the murderers are not the immediate reservation guest of the SARS-CoV.
The philogenetic analysis is described, the MERS-CoV is categoryed in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 and the CoV-HKU5 decoration.
The CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same gas receptor, dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for the input of the virus.
The sequences of the MERS-CoV polymerase ARN depending on the MERS-CoV philogenically are closer to its antiparties of betacoronavirus of muscles identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, a MERS-CoV can't be found alive in sausy bullets.
MERS-CoV and its nearest family, the CoV-HKU25, have a 87 % nuclear sequence approval.
On the other hand, the murderer could not be the immediate reservation guest of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary are seropocytic in the EU-CoV neutralized antibodies, as well as the camels originating from the Middle East in several African countries.
A MERS-CoV lives similar to the virus found in humans was isolated from the dromedary nose, which supports even more than the camels act as good reserve guests of MERS-CoV.
Moreover, it should be highlighted that weight symptoms were generally observed, but a massive propagation of virus in infected camels for investigations with MERS-CoV.
Note, infected camels propagate viruss not only by respiratory, but also by fecal-oral way, which is also the main way of propagation of viruses of murcyelags.
However, there are questions, since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact with camels before the appearance of the symptoms, which is a reason for transmission between humans or unknown transmissions that will involve unrecognized animal species that are located in MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 holds a 96.2 % nucleotic homologation with a coronavirus of murcyelags, RaTG13, isolated of Rhinolophus affinis murcelags.
As in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to allocate a parental relationship.
That is, the murderers may not be the immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronavirus of presumptuously identical murcelags.
Apparently, the intermediate animal guests of the SARS-CoV-2 should be among the silvest species sold and killed in the majorist market of Huan's marines, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, which indicates an event of transmission of animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on the metagenological sequence suggested that a group of small mammifers in danger, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also locate an ancient betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genes of this new coronavirus of pangolines are a 85-92 % nuclear sequence homologation with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equal to eastly related to the RATG13, with an identity of about 90% at the level of nuclear sequence.
Two virus sublines similar to SARS-CoV-2 are grouped in the philogenetic tree, one of whom a conjunction domain to the recipient (RBD) is more like SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4 % aminoacidose sequence identity.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the RaTG13 are more different, despite a greater sequence homologation in the whole gene.
A previous study in pangolines also informed the detection of viral counts in pulmonal samples, which also resulted in association with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a sequence of partial genema that included about 86.3% of the full-length viral gene.
We cannot dismiss the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence currently that it supports a direct source in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutive way of SARS-CoV-2 in murderers, pangolins and other mammifers should still be established.
Although the highest sequence approval was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are the highest complete gene sequence approval.
It is extremely speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the betacoronavirus of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is the medium-selectivity convergence evolution.
A contra proposal determines a recombination between the betacoronavirus of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RATG13 in the third species of silvestre animals.
As impulsive force in evolution, the recombination is extended between betacoronavirus.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogen human coronavirus, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU
The philogenic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from coronavirus of murcyelags, while the HCoV-OC43 parental viruss and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rotators.
It was informed that a coronavirus of murciélags named ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a tricolor mudleague in Northern America had an east relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another coronavirus of murciélags, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, even though it was also suspicious of camelides as intermediate guests.
For more clearness, knowledge that has until the time of the animal origins of the known human coronavirus is summarized in figure 1 and Table 2.
The philogenetic analysis has shown events of human coronavirus transmission between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 cross between species to infect humans from gained animals in 1890, an respiratory infection pandemy was registered.
Transmission precedents between species of HCoV-229E are not so precisely known.
Alphacoronavirus of murcyelags has been found is fully related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is a alpaca alfacoronavirus.
Several evidence lines support the transmission of the virus of murderers to humans directly.
Firstly, in the contrary to the alpacs, humans could have contact with murderers in a ecological nine.
Instead, people have close contact with the alpacs.
Secondly, the alfacoronavirus of muscles related to HCoV-229E are different and not patogenic in the muscles, while the alpac alfacoronavirus caused a breath of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavirus in silvest animals was not found.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacs add the alfacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E of humans is not possible.
In fact, murderers are the direct source of patogenous virus in humans, such as the wrath virus, the Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Moreover, it would not be too surprising that murderers would send HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while the alfacoronavirus of muscles act as a genetic acerve of HCoV-229E, the alpacs and dromedary could act as intermediate guests that transmit virus to humans, particularly in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a excellent example of transmission between species, muscles to dromedary and human dromedary.
The evolutional origin of MERS-CoV in the murderers is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is evident that murderers contribute, with a pursuant profuse of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, social interaction is and the great ability to fly, are all favourable conditions that make murderers in the ideal "virus promotor".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedary by debt.
It is well adjusted to these camels, which have passed to be an intermediate guest, to be a stabil and natural reserve guest.
MERS-CoV causes very low disease and maintains a low mutation rate in these animals.
Its esporatic transmission to humans is a accident, and humans are still a terminal host of MERS-CoV, since transmission is unsustainable.
In comparison with the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolines, if it had, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangoline betacoronavirus are highly patogenic in pangolines.
It may be a terminal guest of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, such as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
A number of possibilities of transmission between types of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans should be confirmed or rejected in future studies.
First, murderers could be the reserve gas of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could hold the ecological nine with the murderers, ≥ killing or carbon minery.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifier guests in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 was recently introduced.
Humans count the virus to the killing and consumption of cattle meat.
Many mammifers, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An anti-corps study is required in domestic animals and silvests.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact both the murderers and the pangolines.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Besides the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also perform an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing the barriers of the species.
First, their high mutation rates in the RN replication.
In comparison with other monocatenary ARN viruss, the estimated mutation rates of coronavirus could be considered "moderated" to "height" with a average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, by site 2, is the stage of adaptation of coronavirus to new guests.
Coronavirus has an exorribonuclease of reading checks, which is eliminated by extremely high mutability and atenuation or, even inviability.
Interestingly, it is known that rendesivir nuclear analogue removes the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and ARN polymerase depending on ARN.
Rendevir is one of the most promising agents anti-SARS-CoV-2 that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronavirus are nearly a million times higher than those of their guests.
Moreover, the mutation rate seems to be high when coronavirus is not well adjusted to the hospital.
In comparison with SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be less, which suggests a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is hoped that it has already been adapted to another near human guest.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adjusted to dromedary.
In theory, it is impossible that genetic derivatives make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 quickly lose their effectiveness.
Secondly, the long ARN gene of the coronavirus exercises additional plastic in the change of the gene for mutations and recombination and, in this way, increases the probability of coevolution between species, which provides the appearance of new coronavirus when the appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the single open-copy reading frames and the functions of the proteins encoded to the 3' address of the gene.
Thirdly, coronavirus changes randomly and often templates during the RNA replication through a single mechanism of "copy-choice".
In a guest acting as a mixture vehicle, the chain change is often produced during the cronavirus ARN transscription.
Full and subgenomic ARN highly homologic can be recombined to generate new coronavirus.
The philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in the coronavirus of animals, such as the SL-CoV of murcelago and the CoV-HKU9.
Virus-huespeed interaction in relation to transmission
Besides the three previously mentioned viral factors, the viral interaction with the gas receptor is another key factor that affects the transmission of species.
Today, the SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which also showed positive evidence of selection in transmission events between species.
On the basis of the comparative analysis between ais-covs of the SARS-CoV of human and civics, SARS-CoV is considered to experience a quick adaptation in different guests, especially with mutations in the S protein RBD.
Generally, the S protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell recipient and is chosen intensely by the response to anticorps of the hospital.
In the SARS-CoV, the RBD is located in the 318 to 510 amino acids in S1, which is associated with the human ACE2 and its correctors for viral input.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 recipients of several animals, including murder, civet, mouse and dog map, which allows transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed, only 6 residues of aminoacidos were different from the aceous human and civic viruses in the RBD and 4 of them were found in the reason for association with the recipient for interaction with the ACE2 recipient.
The SARS-CoV of civetes has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with the ACE2 recipient.
In other words, these two substances of amino acid may be fundamental for the adjustment of virus to humans.
It should be highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 is the same cell recipient with SARS-CoV.
A difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein S1 means that the affinity of protein S unit with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, a study of electromicroscopy indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times greater than this union in comparison with the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interested in determining whether any other corrector could be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 is also with the ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidese N in HCoV-229E and sial acid 9-O-acetilated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans, after transmission of species from their animal guests.
Besides cell recipients, the result of the transmission between human coronavirus species is also determined by other factors of dependence and limitation of the gas.
The divergence of these gas proteins between humans and human coronavirus natural reserve guests, such as muscles, dromedary and rotators, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Coronavirus of humans must hold the factors of gas dependence and substrate gas restriction factors so that the transmission between species is successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-huesped interaction must still be identified and characterized.
It could be beneficial for an objective analysis of the full gene of the factors of dependence and limitation of the gases for SARS-CoV-2 using the progressive CRISPR technology.
Appearance of new human coronavirus: we're going from zero
The diversity of the coronavirus of murcyelags provides many opportunities for the appearance of new human coronavirus.
In this sense, the coronavirus of musclelags act as the genetic acerve of human coronavirus.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination stimulates the evolution of human coronavirus and are two important steps of this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoding genes have the potential to drastic change viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV access proteins, ORF8 was considered important in the adaptation to humans, since the SARS-CoV viruss were isolated, but it was determined that different ORF8 proteins were encoded.
A elimination of 29 characteristic nucleotides from SARS-CoV was found at the beginning of epidemia in humans.
This elimination is divided into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of guests.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has possible recombination precedents with alfa and coronavirus lines, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions was identified in the RN polymerase RN.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of Nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has suffered recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedary in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronavirus, where human coronavirus is recombined with other animal coronavirus in their non-equivalent genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to non-desidered changes in viral genes, which most likely results from liberating the virus of the exercised selection pressures, for example by the immune system of the hospital.
An example of these effects is the loss of a complete ORF4 length in the HCoV-229E prototype cepa, due to a elimination of two nuclears.
Although ORF4 could be observed intactly in the virus of musclelags and camels related to HCoV-229E, the alfacoronavirus of alpacs presents an insertion of a single nucleotide, which causes a change of frame.
Finally, although not at least important, the evolution of the new human coronavirus is also impulsed by the selection pressure in their reserve guests.
No symptoms have been detected or only light symptoms have been detected when infections with coronavirus were infected, which indicates mutual adjustment between coronavirus and muscles.
It seems to be well adjusted to the coronavirus anatomically and physically.
For example, defects in the activation of proinflamatory response in muscles decreasedly the pathology caused by coronavirus.
Moreover, the activity of natural murder cells in the murderers is removed due to the positive regulation of the inhibitor of natural murder cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I moleculars of the higher histocompatibility complete.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive species of oxygen (ROS) generated from the high metal activity of the murcyelags could remove the replication of the coronavirus and affect the check of reading exorribonuclease, which results in the selection pressure for the generation of highly patogenous virus sheets when they are introduced into a new guest.
More patogenous coronavirus sheep could also develop by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for gas adaptation.
Therefore, it is not likely that three new human coronavirus have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronavirus is not patogenic or caused heavy symptoms in their reserve guests, such as murderers and camels.
They are energetically replicated without providing a strong immune response to the hospital.
This radiates the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious infection cases in humans.
Several symptoms are primarily responsible for the hyperactivation of the immune response and the urgency of citokines, where as much as the immune response is stronger, more serious is the pulmonary damage.
In contrast, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been disconnected from the replication of coronavirus.
The same imunitary response strategy could have beneficial effects on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The response to interferon is especially strong in the murderers.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 in humans should be beneficial.
Furthermore, the activation of NLRP3 inflamasom in myrcelags is defectuous.
If this reasoning is made, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflamasom with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a betacoronavirus of murcylags has been found that has a 95 % nucleotides homologation with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of murcylags that holds a 96 % nucleotides homologation with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been determined that market civics and other animals have similar viruses to SARS-CoV, there have not been identified immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2.
Betacoronavirus of pangolines note homologs have been found to SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that pangoline betacoronavirus could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questionnaires, there are no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by the man, whether it is deliberately or in a case.
Coronavirus has recovered protagonism due to the recent brake of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in murcyelags and other animals has deeply changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic origins and animal reserves of human coronavirus in human transmission.
This evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in the murderers and transferred to humans to intermediate guests.
Since the infection by SARS-CoV originates in the contact between humans and citizens on the markets, closing the humid markets and killing the civics that were in them could have been effective to breathe the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should be removed from humid markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, taking into account the discovery of several pangoline betacoronavirus lines is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how and how SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans to pangolines and other mammifers, it remains diluted in future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV exists in dromedary long ago.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, cut and lane for local population.
They are largely distributed by Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as made in China with the markets of wild animals to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent repeated MERS breaks, an integral approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not to remove these viruses, new genotypes could appear that cause broths.
A variety of zoonotic coronavirus, they are being in salvage state.
In particular, the coronavirus of muscles with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are large possibilities that these zoonotic coronavirus evolute and recycle, which would lead to the appearance of new coronavirus that are more transmissible or more mortal in humans in the future.
The culture of wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until the opportunity is present.
Although murderers have many characteristics that promote the propagation of virus, the opportunities for human contact with murderers and other silver species can be minimised if they educate the population to get away from them.
Continue monitoring of mammifers is necessary to better understand the practice of coronavirus and their natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future brotes.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans remain away from the ecological nines of the natural reserves of zoonotic virus.
There are still several parts in the rubber of the zoonotic source of SARS-CoV-2.
Firstly, if the murderers transfer an ancestral virus from SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze the circumstances in which the murcyelags and pangolines could have the same ecological nick.
Secondly, if murderers have a more direct role in transmission in humans, it should be determined how humans are in contact with murderers.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer acts as the true intermediate guest, it should dilute how he interacts with different species, including humans, murderers and pangolins.
Finally, because many mammifers, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
It is already a murderer, a pangolin or another mammifer, expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental virus that are almost identical are identified in its natural guests in the future.
Continuing research in this area will dilute the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria of the "supported cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 must be updated
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for diagnosis and treatment of the infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guide included our experience and is a good reference to fight against this pandemy worldwide.
However, the disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of the results of current research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continually updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of "supported case" and "confirmed case" are the last 日s for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 (seventh and §) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a break, which is now officially known as the disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus 2 of the serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemy.
To fight the infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a quick advice guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He has taken much attention since it has been published.
However, it must be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of the results of current research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continually updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven issues and some contexts have changed consideration.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., submitted a simple clasification proposal based on its clinical experience.
His work took new tests for our guidelines and is also a valuable reference to this pandemy worldwide.
We support your important work and express our appreciation.
However, your work also needs update is the last 日s for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 (seventh version of the test) and recent studies.
Seventh and seventh (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case, is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological precedents with two points of clinical manifestations to make an exhaustive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be fulfilled if there are no clear epidemiological precedents:
Epideological entities: (1) preliminary trip or residence in the city of Wuhan and the Netherlands, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been informed in the last 14 days prior to the appearance of symptoms; (2) previous contacts with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nuclear acid test); (3) preconcedents of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan and remote areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been informed in the last 14 days before the appearance of the symptoms; (4) before contact groups of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fibre or respiratory symptoms occur in the period of 2 weeks in small areas, etc.)
Clinical indications: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics of infection images by COVID-19; (3) total contents of white globules showing a content of normal, reduced or reduced linfocides in the early starting stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some characteristics of patogenic or serological tests as follows: (1) tests of re-time-polymerase reaction for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the complete viral genealogy that shows high humidity to the recognised new coronavirus; (3) positive results for the specific IgM anticorps and the specific IgG anticorporal against SARS-CoV-2 in a safe test; or a change of the specific IgG anticorps against SARS-CoV-2 of negative to positive, or increase of the title ≥4 times more in the phase of recovery than in the acute phase.
We can see that the test of real-time reaction of polymerase to detect nuclear acid in blood samples or respiratory paths has reached the second edition (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
The detection of patogens of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues, and then serological tests were added to the seventh and seventh.
{NS}
Furthermore, there are more evidence that reveal that we should be stumbled with the asymptic and atypical patients.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. flow diagram should be updated, since they have classified the person without clinical symptoms as of "low risk".
The pointing system should also be checked in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence occur, and we ask the readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "supported case" and "confirmed case", we recommend to search and comply with the newest directions of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline appropriately to provide help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest amount in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths yesterday because of COVID-19 on one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in one day due to virus.
By yesterday, the Bangladesh Epidemiology Institute, Insurance and Research Control (IEDCR) reported that the number of infections registered included 114 active cases and 33 restored cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths has been registered.
At a online information session, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that victims were four men and a woman.
Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years, two between 51 and 60 years and one between 41 and 50 years.
He also said that two of the victims were from Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemy.
An hospital officer said to Anadolu Agency, a local news media, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anticorruption Commission, to whom they were working in Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
The Sabbath, in a online video announcement, the Minister for Transport by Carretera and Poentes of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that the public transport would be suspended for more time than planned once until this next Sabbath.
This suspension of the public transport was initially started on 26 March and was intended to end the Sabbath 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical, fuel and food supplies, was still allowed.
The first cases registered by COVID-19 in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, two men returned from Italy and also the woman of one of them.
On 19 March, these three have already been recovered.
More than one million infections by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exceeded a million over the world, is data from the University Johns Hopkins.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The hito occurred on the same day that Malaui confirmed his first infections by coronavirus and Zambia had its first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea, on Thursday, was one of the few countries without infection by coronavirus.
On yesterday, the World Health Organization informed 1 051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10:00 p.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 000 cases of coronavirus were recorded with at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting the data of the University of Johns Hopkins, that Wednesday there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
In all the world, the countries have announced more strict measures to inhibit the propagation of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Master of Moscow, extended the close of the city to 1 May.
At national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to understand their salaries without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes for, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the remaining tocks in the holy cities La Meca and Medina for the whole day; first, the remaining touch was only held between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand planned to implement a delay tok between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until 1 May.
Supermarkets in adequately reduce the hygiene paper limits by transaction
On Sunday and Sabbath after the afternoon, the bullets of Australian supermarkets Wool ́ths and Coles decreased their hygiene paper buying limits to two and a transaction package in all the supermarkets of the country respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the strings.
It was informed that consumers were in fear of the COVID-19 if people had to be self-suspend.
On Wednesday, Wool月ths also limited hygiene paper purchases to deliver home to a package by request.
These changes have been introduced after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction applied by Woollts and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his press communication of 8 March, informed that, with the application of the four package restriction, "much supermarketing even exhausted the product within one hour of delivery," and said that the request "not having aires", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on March, said that it was "inexpected".
The sales went up with a "fortunate increase" last week, it is a Wool's voice.
The Supermarket Costco in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
In order to relieve more deficiency, Coles requested larger packages to the suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Wool月ths ordered additional existences, while ALDI provided existences available for a special offer of the previously planned midnight.
Zimmerman, executive director of Retailers, said that minorists are trying to increase existence, but the restrictions of local adjunction on the times of carriers are difficult.
Increasing production costs, according to the suppliers are trying to satisfy the request, and less offers.
On Wednesday, ALDI announced that, after the previous release of existence, some supermarketings cannot make the special offer of midnight.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a minorist selling expert from the Queensland Technology University, said that supermarketings are abusing the existence every night.
He highlighted that the hygiene role is a voluminous article, which causes a low amount of existence in numbers, and, when it goes out, leaves a wide spacing in the stones, which intensifys the feeling of escape.
Coles and Woolities have the idea of [which] if there were a number of articles in the stationers, if products like hygiene and desinfektive paper roles could be [comprehensive] and there were large quantities, probably the panic would be minimised, said Zimmerman by ABC News.
The recycled hygiene paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that took the existence.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces the hygiene paper Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent, indicated that they were working at the 24 hours of the day, the 7 days of the week, to maintain the supplier, is the report in News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, informed that some property sellers offered free hygiene paper to the first licitor in the substances in Melbourne, when they were made less subests because the purchasers had time for the long weekend end of the Working Day.
The e of the NT News Thursday, a printed journal in Darwin, included an eight-page encampment designed to cut and use it as a hygiene paper.
The supermarkets at the beginning were shown reactions to impose restrictions, if ABC'a report of 3 March, where they said that they had no plans to introduce restrictions in purchases.
Zimmerman admitted that other products also have a lot of request, including maskers, defectives, sugar products, liquid jabón and harin.
Similarly, outside of Âa, Sunday afternoon was observed that the British supermarket online Ocado limited the purchases of the hygiene paper Andres to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemy
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemium of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" only refers to the size of the propagation of a disease, not to how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need to encourage governments to take measures:
All countries still can change the course of this pandemy.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their people in the response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO said.
We are very concerned both of the alarming levels of propagation and seriousness and of the alarming levels of inaction.
Dr. Tom Peace, Director of the Centres for Control and Prevention of the United States’ Sickness, is the "not having" pandemy.
In statements published by CNN in February, "Admas of the influence, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the appearance to the continuous world propagation".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said, "Not before we saw a pandemy caused by a coronavirus."
"And we never had ever seen a pandemy that could be controlled at the same time," he said.
The new with pandemy comes after the decision of the WHO in January to declare the broadcast an emergency of public health of international importance.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Alergia and Infections in the United States, said, "In conclusion, he's gonna deteriorate."
Even Thursday, Press reported that there were at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 throughout the world, and more than 4600 deaths.
The coronavirus 2019-20 pandemy is a illness pandemy by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The brochure was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, stated international health emergency of international importance on 30 January 2020, and was recognised as pandemy on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 1,61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths were resulted.
Approximately 364 000 people were recovered.
It was estimated that the letality rate for cases was of 4 % in China, while at the world level, between 13,04 % in Algeria and 0,08 % in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, thickness and air failure.
Complications may include neumonia and angry respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from the exposure to the appearance of the symptoms is generally about five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is the symptomatic and supporting therapy. Recommended preventive measures include laying hands, covering the mouth by the toss, maintaining distance from other people and control and self-isolation of people who doubt that they are infected.
The authorities of the world responded through the implementation of travel restraints, quarters, delays, risk controls in the workplace and closing installations.
The pandemy caused a serious global socioeconomic change, the posterging or cancelling of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the generalised shortage of suppliers increasing by the purchases motivated by the panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, which affected about 99.4% of the world's student population.
There were incorrect information on the Internet virus, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of rise and appearance of East and South-East Asia, and other areas with significant virus cases.
As a result of the reduction of travel and closure of the heavy industry, a reduction in air pollution and carbon pollution has occurred.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a group of cases of unknown nemonia, and at the beginning of January 2020 an investigation was initiated.
The cases, in most of them, were related to the majorist market of Huan's marine, therefore, thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the brot is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recent virus is related to the coronavirus of the Murciélagus, the coronavirus of the Pangolins and the SARS-CoV. Later, it was found that the first person who knew that the symptoms had been shown was held on 1 December 2019, and that person had no connections with the last group of the mined market.
The first group of cases reported in December 2019 was determined that two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an uncertain report from South China Morning Post suggested that, as a case was remonted to 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old person from Hubei province could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases, the reports were decreased in China but immediately increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a significant number of uninformed cases, especially among those with lighter symptoms.
On February 26, a few cases were reported in young people, and those of 19 years and less were representing 2,4% of the cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the Scientific Advisor of the United Kingdom, considered that 60% of the British population should be infected before an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of persons subject to tests of COVID-19 and that have received a positive result of the official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had proved more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies to do no evidence in people who had only light symptoms, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March showed that, until 23 January, a estimated amount of 86 % of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these non-registered infections were the infection source of 79 % of the registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the quantities of infections in Italy were higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic playing number (R0) for the COVID-19 were from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Control and Prevention Centres decided that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovered.
For those who do not, the time passed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, which is the most frequent 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 deaths were assigned to the COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths corresponded to those who were more than 60 years old, and 75 per cent had pre-existent diseases, including cardiovascular and diabetes. Official death records by COVID-19 pandemy, generally, refer to the defected persons who had been positive in the COVID test, are official protocols.
It is possible that the number of real deaths due to COVID-19 be much greater, since it may not include those who fail without performing the test, for example, in their homes, in the houses of elderly, etc.
Partial data in Italy showed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemy was the official death record by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A vote of the Centres for the Control and Prevention of Disasters (CDC) of the United States admitted "We know that [the number of declared deaths] is a subestimation," a sub-estimation corrupted by the anecdotic reports in the United States. This subestimation is often in pandemies, such as in the H1N1 porch gripe pandemy of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside the continental China occurred on 1 February in Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside the continental China, more than one decade was registered in each country of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had informed deaths in all continents except Antarktis. In general, several indicators were used to quantify mortality.
These numbers were different from the region and with time, and are affected by the quantity of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time passed from the start-up and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths in cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases within a specified time range.
The statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins are described, the global proportion of deaths on cases is 6,0 % (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number was different to the region.
In China, the estimates of death per case were decreased from 17,3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms appearance after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the letality rate for cases, which reflect the percentage of persons who failed due to a disease, and the letality rate for infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and unexpected) failing because of a disease.
These statistics do not have a specified period and consider a particular population from the infection to the case resolution.
Some academics have calculated these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the letality rate for pandemy infections is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest estimation of this rango is coherent with the results of the first accidental tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of tests on the estimations of letality rates per case.
The OMS is that pandemy can be controlled.
The pipe and final duration of the brot are uncertain and can be different if the location is different.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania indicated, "The infectional breaks, if they are not controlled, are generally stabilised and then begin to decrease when the disease remains without guests available.
But at this moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prevision of which it will happen."
The Chine's main medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan's Government, suggested that "the can end in June" if all countries can be mobilised to follow the WHO recommendation on the measures to stop the virus propagation.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, from the Hygiene and Tropical Medicina in London, expressed that SARS-CoV-2 " will be able, perhaps for one or two years."
The study of the Imperial College addressed by Neil Ferguson, the physical distance and other measures will be necessary "to be available to a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of the Vanderbilt University expressed, "I think it's little that this coronavirus, since it is so easy, disappears completely" and "I can become a stational disease, which appears all the years."
The virulence of reapparition would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be non-specific and infected people may be asintomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fibre (88 %) and your sugar (68 %).
The less common symptoms include fatal, epoch production in respiratory ways (fleme), loss of the sense of olfate, missing air, muscle and articular pain, hot pain, head pain, scalophry, vomits, hemoptisis, diarrea or cianosis. The OMS is about one of each six people seriously and has difficulty to breathe.
The Centres for the Control and Prevention of Disasters (CDC) of the United States, the symptoms of emergency include difficulty to breathe, pressure or persistent pain in the wheat, repentant confusion, difficulty to wake up and color in the faces or the symptoms; before demonstration of these symptoms, the immediate medical attention is recommended. The greatest progress of the disease can cause serious nemonia, a sepse, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected persons may be asymptomatic, not present clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, researchers therefore recommended to control and examine those who have close contact with infected persons confirmed to dismiss the infection.
The Chinese estimates of the proportion of asintomatic persons are of some to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between the infection and the appearance of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; most often is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of olfate at the beginning was 30% and then reduced to 15%.
Some details are still determining how the disease is spread.
It is considered that the disease is mainly spread during the close contact and to ≥ the small bottles produced by the tossing, sterning or speaking; the heavy contact is considered a distance from 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
The studies are observed, without covering the mouth, the hairs can be moved from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted to ≥ small shots that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. They can also produce respiratory clothes during exhalation, even when talking, even though, generally, the virus is not transmitted by the air.
The hairs can enter into the mouth or narrow of people who are near or may be inhaled to the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intuition and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) can cause the dissolving of the respiratory secretions and, therefore, the air propagation.
It can also be spread when one touchs a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, the narrow or the mouth.
Although there is anxiety that it can be transmitted to → of the stakeholders, it is considered that this risk is low.
The Chinese Government refused the possibility of oral heat transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the symptoms appear, although propagation may be possible before the symptoms and at the most progressive stages of the disease.
People have received positive results in the disease tests until three days before symptoms appear, which indicates that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only some asintomatic case reports confirmed by age, but some countries have identified a asintomatic transmission during contact trace investigations.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Sickness (ECDC) suggests that, although it is not fully clear that the facility with which the disease is propagated is generally a person infected by two or three other. The virus survives from hours to day on the surfaces.
Specificly, it was determined that the virus was detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable acid 304, one day in carton and up to four hours in cover.
This, however, varied from humidity and temperature. positive results were obtained in tests of the COVID-19 on mask and other animals.
There are no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend to lay their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of the severe aggressive respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated by three people with neumonia linked to the group of aggressive respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are located in the coronavirus related to the nature. Out of the human body, the virus dies when he comes into contact with jabon, which solves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is fully related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thinking he's got a zoonotic source.
Genetic analyses showed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the betacoronavirus gene, its subgeneral sarbecovirus (linea B) together with two derivative seeds of the morcelago.
At the level of the whole gene, it is 96 % identical to other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in aminoacides in some parts of the sequences of the gene between pangolines virus and humans.
By the date, the total gene comparison indicated that the coronavirus of pangolines and the SARS-CoV-2, as maximum, 92% of the genetic material, which is not enough to demonstrate that pangolines are the intermediate guest.
The infection by the virus may be temporarily caused on the basis of symptoms, although at the last instance it is confirmed to the reaction of the polymerase chain with inverse transcriptase (RRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerised tomography images.
A study conducted in Wuhan in which the reaction of polymerase was compared to computerized tomography, computerised tomography is much more sensitive than the reaction of polymerase, even less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images correspond to the processes of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "not using computerised tomography as a detection method or as a first line test for COVID-19".
The WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first published on 17 January.
The test uses the reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase in real time (RRT-PCR).
The test can be made in blood or respiratory samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours or days.
In general, this test is performed with a nasofaringeo hisopo, although it can also be used a hysopo for the gargant. Some companies and companies are developing serological tests, which detect anticorps.
On 6 April 2020, none of these demonstrated to be sufficiently precise in order to approve their generalized use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was adopted for use of emergency by only certificates.
The characteristic races in computerized radiography and tomography images (TC) of syntomatic persons include opacities in azymetric peripheric glass and unexpected pleural degrees.
The Italian Radio Society is compiling a international database online of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Because of the superposition with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis for images without confirmation through polymerase in chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of the COVID-19.
A broad study conducted in China compared the results of torax tomagraphy with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although the diagnostic for images is less specific for the effect, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by epidemia.
Convolutional neuronal networks based on artificial intellectuality were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with radiographs and computerized tomographs.
Strategy to prevent the transmission of the disease includes maintaining a good general hygiene, laying hands, avoiding touching the eyes, narrow or mouth with hands without laying them before, and stopping or tossing on a dischargeable bottle and dragging the bottle right in a waste container.
It is recommended that those who could already be infected use a chirurgical mask in public.
Many governments have restricted or disregarded all non-essential travels from and to countries and areas affected by the brot.
However, the virus has reached the Community propagation phase in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is propagating within the communities, and some members of the community don't know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended that medical care providers that affect someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. The trace of contacts is an important method to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent greater transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments with this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and the International Amnistia and more than 100 other organizations have issued a declaration for limits on this type of monitoring.
Some mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and on 7 April 2020, more than one decade of expert groups were working in respectful solutions with privacy, such as using Bluetooth to register the closeness of a user to other cell phones.
The users then receive a message if they were nearly contacted with someone who gave a positive in the test of the COVID-19. They are making misunderstood ideas about how to prevent the effect; for example, the nose lavage and the garages with boat enjuging are not effective.
There is no vaccine against the COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
The lavage of hands is recommended to prevent the propagation of disease.
CDC recommends that people lay their hands frequently with water and jabbe for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have their hands swimming; before eating and after sounding the narrow, toser or sterndur.
This must be that, outside the human body, the virus dies when he comes into contact with jabon, which disintegrates his protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended to use a deinfectant for alcohol-based hands with at least 60% of alcohol in volume when no water and jabón is available.
The OMS recommends people to avoid touching the eyes, narrow or mouth with hands without laving them before.
The surfaces may be decontaminated with various solutions (in a minute after the defective exposure in an inoxidable acid surface), including ethanol at 62-71 %, isopropanol at 50-100 %, natrium hypochloride at 0,1 %, peroxide of 0,5 % and yod powder at 0,2-7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and clorhexid gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as a office or guard, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, electronic equipment, such as tablets, tactiles, keyboards, remote controls and automatic boxes that have used people.
Health organizations recommend that people cover the mouth and narrow with the flexioned code or with a dischargeable bottle to toss or sternup, and that they want the bottle immediately.
It is recommended that those who could be infected use chirurgical maskers, since the use of a maskery can limit the volume and distance covered by the respiratory captains that are spread by speaking, sternering and tossing.
The OMS issued instructions about with and how to use maskers.
See See Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Use a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch the face, which is an important source of infection without a suitable hygiene." It has also been recommended to use mascarillas in people who care for someone who could have the disease.
The OMS has recommended the use of healthy persons only if they run a high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although he also recognises that use of maskers can help people to avoid touching the face.
Many countries have started to promote the use of maskers by the public.
In the United States, CDC recommends use of non-medicin maskers manufactured with screen. China recommended specifically the use of unexpected medical maskers by the healthy members of the public, especially when they are nearly contacted (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends use a chirurgical maskery to take public transport or to be in competitive places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend people to make screen maskers in their homes and lay them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia went out to the public spaces without using a mascarilla or without covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people use a mascarilla when being in public spaces to protect and protect others.
The Government of Austria was the use of maskers by all persons who entered into a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use public mascarillas.
Thaiwan, who has produced ten million maskers per day since mid-March, was the use of maskers by passengers in interurban trains and buses.
Panamá imposed the mandatory use of maskers to get out to the free air, while he also recommended the manufacture of maskers made home to those who cannot buy them.
Mascarillas have also been used generally in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures for control of the infection designed to reduce the propagation of disease by minimising close contact between persons.
The methods include quarters, travel restrictions and closure of schools, jobs, stations, theatres and commercial centres.
People can implement social distance methods by staying in their homes, limiting travels, avoiding competited areas, using health forms that do not include contacts and physically distant from other people.
Many governments now require or recommend social distance in regions affected by the broadband.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by the Governing Boards and the United States Health Organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there were no COVID-19 extension in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany held the public meetings of more than two persons. The older adults and those with subcutaneous diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immunity systems have a higher risk of suffering of serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommends that they remain in their homes as possible in the areas of the community affected by the brote. At the end of March 2020, the OMS and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" by "fysical distance" to explain that the objective is to reduce physical contact while they are maintaining social connections, whether or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distance" has affected the idea that people should adopt a complete social isolation rather than encourage them to keep contact with others with alternative media. Some authorities have published directly sexual health issues to use during the pandemy.
They include recommendations to have only sexual relations with a person who is alive, which does not have the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
The auto-isolation was recommended in the house of those who were infectioned by the COVID-19 and those who doubt that they had been infected.
Health Agencies have published detailed instructions on suitable auto-isolation. Many governments have or recommended the autoquartenan of all populations in the areas concerned.
The more strict autoquartain instructions were issued for those who belong to high risk groups.
Persons who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with generalized transmission are recommended to make autoquarten for 14 days since the last possible exposure.
The strategies to control a brot are containing or suppression and mixing.
The content is carried out in the first phases of the broadband and has the purpose of identifying and isolating infected people, as well as introducing other control measures for infection and vaccines to avoid propagating disease to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to control the propagation of the disease, efforts are moved to the mixture stage: measures are taken to prevent propagation and reduce their effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containing and mixing measures can be taken at the same time.
The elimination reacts to extreme measures to be able to restore pandemy to ≥ the reduction of the basic number of reproduction less than 1. Part of controlling the breath of a infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic pipe, which is known as a planning of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of colapsing health services and allows more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the broadcast include personal preventive measures, such as hygiene of hands, use of maskers and self-quartene; Community measures oriented to physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of massive competition events; the Community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures and surfaces. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the broth once their seriousness resulted evidently, for example, the implementation of cartainties in all cities and the imposition of strict traveling.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures to limit virus propagation.
South Korea implemented massive and quarter detection evaluations and warned about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to make quarter and impose great wages to those who did not.
Thaiwan increased the production of mascarillas and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. The simulations in British and the United States show that the mixture (which reduces the propagation of epidemia but not holds it) and the elimination (the growth of pandemy) has great challenges.
Optical mixing policies could reduce the maximum medical attention request in two third parties and deaths at half, but even generating hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapsing of health systems.
The elimination may be preferred, but it must be maintained for all the time the virus is in human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if it happens first), because, in contrast, transmission is quickly reactivated when measures are flexible.
The long-term intervention to eliminate pandemy involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for the COVID-19, but they are striving to develop them, which includes testing of existing medicines.
Taking free sale medicines for refrigerated, drinking liquids and resting can help alive symptoms.
Severity is performed, oxygenotherapy, intravenous liquids and respiratory assistance can be needed.
The use of steroids can reduce the results.
Several components have been investigated for the treatment of other viral diseases to use them in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also indicated that some "traditional and traditional areas" can alive the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO describes the increase in the capacity and adaptation of medical attention to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to breast.
The ECDC and the Regional Office for Europe of the WHO have directly formulated hospitals and primary medical care services for re-distribution of resources at different levels, which includes focusing on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures, where possible, separating and isolating positive patients in COVID-19 and enhancing intensive care capacity through the personal and increased amount of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case could be originated (the named Null Patient).
The first case known to the new coronavirus may be remonted to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
During a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These were primarily linked to the majorist of Huan's marine market, which also sold live animals, and a theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, which had a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of neumonia was not known from which Dr. Zhang Jixian was charged in the Provincial Hospital of Hubei, who informed the Jianghan CDC on 27 December.

The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development lays a platform to provide full and appropriate information on political responses in the countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
From political policies to strengthen the health and world economy to enlarge the effects of the limitation and travel restrictions, the digital center includes a traveller of policies by country, and it is the finality of helping countries to acquire one another and to facilitate a global response coordinated to the challenges of the coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Ministry of the Office of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, by its manager of the Pandemy, which eats in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of administrators at the original level of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) was dismissed because of its management of the efforts relating to the Quarentane in Central China, a sign of disappointment with the response of the political system to breaking in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jin, from the public wrath of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officers, for example, Zhao Lijian, discouraged a previous recognition from the beginning of the coronavirus brote in Wuhan, for conspirative theories on the origin of the COVID-19 in the United States or Italy.
The administration of Donald Trump of the United States has referred to coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", and said that "China's censure has overcome a virus that has now become a world pandemy," which has been indicated by some critics as racism and "distrac] of its administration's failure to contain disease.
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the Government of the U.S. that described a strategy of communications with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and the strategy was quoted as "All about China".
We have been told that we are trying to send this message anyway, including press conferences and television appearances. "The media of communication such as Policy, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have concluded that China's efforts to send aid to the countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain world influenza.
The representative of foreign policy of the European Union, Josep Borrell, warned that " there is a geopolitic component that includes a fight against propaganda influence and generosity policy."
Borrell also said, "China is aggressively impulsing the message that, in contrast to the United States, it is a responsible and confidential partner."
China also requested that the United States lead their sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, in reports, sending aid to these two recent countries.
On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked the donation of Jack Ma of 100 000 maskers in Cuba.
It was also accused of the authorities and responsibility to transfer aid to other countries to their own country.
And there have been reported discussions relating to mascarillas between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
Moreover, Turkey took hundreds of respirators destinated to Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador before the European Union, said that "Solo China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin provided that the Russian Army sends military medicals, special disinfect vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian period La Stampa quoted an anonymous high-level political source that implied that 80% of Russia's aid was "inutile or shortly used for Italy".
The source accused Russia to undertake a "geopolitic and diplomatic official".
The President of Lombardia, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Mayo, deceived the periodic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a carriage aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin's carrier, Dmitry Peskov, said that "in offering aid to colleagues and aid, [Putin] assumes that when manufacturers and equipment of material and medical equipment cover impulse, they can also match if necessary."
The planned military exercise of the OTAN "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and Baltic countries, the greatest war exercise of the OTAN since the end of the Friday War, will be made to a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarma, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise of Defender 2020: "In the current crisis of public health, life is in danger not only of the United States and the different European countries who participate, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iran Government has seen very affected by the virus, with about two decades of members infected by Parliament, as well as fifty other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to the world leaders to ask for assistance, and said that his country has difficulties to fight the break because of the lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States' sanctions against Iran. The brochure encouraged the need to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal childal attention, refunded family licence and greater levels of public health funds.
Political analystes predicted that Donald Trump could negatively affect the possibilities of reelecting in the presidential election of 2020.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive trials", after Japan announced that any person from South Korea will remain in quarterine for two weeks in sites appointed by the Government.
The South Korean society at the beginning was polylarized with regard to the response of Moon Jae-in before the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests for Moon's destitution because they considered a wrong management of the broadcast by the Government, or to praise their response, and the pandemy has allowed countries to adopt emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed the concern that governments might allow to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted in order to allow the Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to govern indefinitely, suspend Parliament and elections and sanctify those who believe that they have distributed information on the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
Coronavirus broadcast of several cases of lack of supplies, as a result of the greatest use at the world level of equipment to combat broadcasting, panic purchases and interruptions of logistic and factory operations.
The food and medicines of the United States has published warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to the greatest request for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
A number of locations also have been presented purchases impulsed by the panic that left empty stations of essential products, such as food, hygiene paper and embotel water, which caused the escape of supplies.
The Technological sector, in particular, has warned the delays for the sending of electronic products.
The Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, has increased the request for personal protection equipment 100 times.
This request generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays from four to six months in the supply of medical articles.
He also caused a absence of personal protection teams throughout the world, and the WHO warned that this would be dangerous for healthy workers.
The pandemy provided a new opportunity for the purchasers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a non-sufficiency for children in some supermarketing and later was held by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in the north of Italy and the Wuhan region, and the next request for food products, no of these areas has been affected by the escape of food.
The measures of China and Italy against the compulsory and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, and have avoided a weak shortage of food in Europe and in Northern America.
The northern Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, which are representatives of the sector.
Food stations were only temporary empty, even in the Wuhan city, while the Chinese government officers freed the reserves of cereal meat to ensure the sufficient food of the population.
In Italy there are similar laws that require food producers to maintain reservations for these events.
The damage in the world economy was felt in China: a periodic report of March 16, China's economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the Government to stop the propagation of the virus, and the minority sales fell by 20,5 %.
Since the continental China is an important economic and manufacturer center, the viral fraction has been considered a significant threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economic Intelligence Unit has pronounced that markets will remain volatile until a more clear picture of potential consequences occur.
In January 2020, some analystes estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could overcome those of the SARS broadcast of 2002-2004.
A estimation of a expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated a impact of more than $300 million on the world's delivery chains that could dure up to two years.
It is reported that the OECD Oil Exporter Organization (OPEC) has been "revoked" after a strong fall in petroleum prices due to the latest request of China.
On 24 February, global value markets fell because of a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside the continental China.
On 27 February, because of the growing concerns about the coronavirus broadcast, several U.S. bursatiles, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow fell 1191 points, the most falling on one day from the financial crisis of 2007-08.
The three ended the week with less than 10 per cent.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH undertaken China's sovereign credit assessment, but maintained a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of the fears of the coronavirus, the greatest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a economic receipt.
The Economy Mohamed El-Erian issued the appropriate emergency measures of the states and central stages.
Central responsibility is re-reactivating faster than re-re-re-re-re-re-the-the-financing 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to traveling, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of governments not to travel to any part of the world.
As a result, many lines have cancelled flights due to the latest request, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British Regional Line Flybe colapsed.
The impact on the sector of cross-border enterprises is a level never previously seen.
Various railway stations and terminals of transborders have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a important season of travels related to the feriders of the New Year of China.
Several events in which major events participate were canceled by national and regional governments, including new Year festivals, while private companies also closed their tourist tents and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of the New Monday Year have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the Prohibited City of Peking and the traditional wounds of the temples.
In 24 of the 31 provincies, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the new Year's dinner to 10 February and ordered the majority of the workshops to not reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80 % of the BDP and 90 % of the exports from the country.
Hong Kong raised its response level to the highest illness and declared an emergency, closed schools to March and canceled its celebrations of New Year. The minorist sector was seen affected at the world level, with reductions in the time of attention or temporary closers.
Minorist visits in Europe and Latin America have reduced 40%.
The minorists of North America and Middle East experienced a fall of 50 to 60%.
This also caused a fall of 33 % to 43 % in the peatonal transit to commercial centres in March compared to February.
The operators of the world's commercial centres introduced additional measures, such as higher hygiene, the installation of term scanners to control the temperature of the buyers and cancellation of events. A estimation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the receipt of the pandemia could leave between 14 and 22 million more in a extreme poverty situation in Latin America of which they had remained in that situation without the pandemy.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the nearly 300 million rural workers in China have been acquired in their homes in provinces of the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million people lost their jobs and requested governmental assistance.
The coronavirus broadcast could cost 47 million employment in the United States and the rate of unemployment can reach 32%, is estimated by the Bank of the Federal Reserva de San Luis. The confination in India has left decades of millions of workers in India (that receives daily salaries) unemployed. 44% of Canadian homes have experienced some kind of unemployment. About 900 000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they have eating the confinedment to the middle of March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French employees requested provisions for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers requested a universal credit plan. Nearly a half million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes supported by the Government, known as Kurzwork, for their workers.
The German labour compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
Sektors of the scenic arts and cultural heritage were deeply affected by pandemy, which affected the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Cultural and arts organizations have tried to perform their mission (frequently financed with public funds) to provide access to the community to cultural heritage, to maintain the security of their employees and the public and to support artists when possible.
For March 2020, in the world and in different degrees, museums, libraries, spectacle sites and other cultural institutions have been unfinished, and their exposures, events and spectacles have been canceled or posterged.
In response, there were great efforts to provide alternative services to digital platforms. Another recent and increased impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and mode defiles.
The cinematographic industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of Santa Week in Rome, which have occurred during the last week of the Christian penitence season of the Quaresma.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians remain in their homes instead of attending from the mice on Sundays; some churches offered the religious services to the radio, transmission in live via the Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
After the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocesis of Rome to close their churches and capsites and with the Place of San Pedro empty of Christian peregrins, other religious organisms also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mixtures, synagogues, temples and gurdwars.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Fridays in the areas affected by the brot and then closed the sanctuaries, while Saudita Arabia held the income of foreign perpetrators and of its residents to the sacred places in La Meca and Medina.
Pandemy has caused the most significant change in the world sports calendar since the Second World War.
Most of the important sport events were canceled or posterged, among them, the EUFA 2019-20 Campeons Liga, the Premier League 2019-20, the EUFA Euro 2020, the NBA session 2019-20 and the NHL session 2019-20.
The brot interrupted the plans of the Olympics Games 2020, which originally were planned to start at the end of July; the International Olympical Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be "reprogramed for a later date to 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". The casinos and other games in the world were closed and online poker turnees were postered or cancelled.
This caused many apostates to recycle on the Internet, many online sites reported significant increases in their rate of new inscriptions. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or canceled concerts.
Many large teatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all spectacles.
Some artists have exploded ways to continue producing and holding their work on the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live spectacle, such as living concerts transmissions or the creation of "festives" on the Internet, so that artists interpret, distribute or distribute their work.
Online, many Internet mems have been distributed on the coronavirus, since many retreat humor and distraction in the middle of the uncertaintydume.
Since the COVID-19 broadcast, there has been a growth of the genofobia, and racism to people of Chinese and Eastern Asian seed, and to people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the region of Asia and the region of the East Asia have been observed.
February information (when most of the cases were still limited to China) documented racist feelings in several groups worldwide that expressed that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a just reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in antichine feelings.
Many residents in Wuhan and Hubei have informed discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside.
After the progress of the broadcast to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first European country who experienced a serious broadcast of the COVID-19 could also be subject to suspicious and xenofobia. The citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea first signed requests to achieve the income of China to their countries in an effort to stop disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend in Twitter.
China, as well as other Asian people in the United Kingdom and in the United States, has informed greater levels of racist insults, as well as aggressions.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized by referring to coronavirus as the "Chine virus", a term that many criticians considered racist and antichine.
Appearants in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ucrainian and foreign evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanzhary.
Reports are reported, students from North-East of India, who have a border with China, and who study in the main Indian cities, suffered accusation in relation to the coronavirus broad.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in Bengala O日al, Dilip Ghosh, expressed that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "hero God has come from them".
The Chinese consulat in Calcutta later condemned the comments and said they were "errorists". In China, they increased xenofobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of pandemy, and described foreigners as "external base" and intended for "destruction".
Many periods with paid walls have removed them for part or all of their covering of coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles relating to the brot available with open access.
Some scientists chose to make their results quickly on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

The tests for respiratory disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those who detect anticorps produced in response to the infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed in the test of reaction in the stream of polymerase with inverse transcriptase, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 ARN virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of anticorps (serology) can be used both for diagnostic and for population monitoring.
The tests of anticorps show how many people have had disease, including those who had too light symptoms to inform them or who were asintomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of disease and the collective immunity level in the population can be determined.
Because of the limited tests, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had proved more than 3% of its population, and there were large changes in the number of tests made in different countries.
This variability is also significantly affecting the letality rates for reported cases, which are probably very high-estimated in some countries.
The test can be made in respiratory samples obtained in several methods, including nasofaringe hisops or esput samples, in the case of the inverse reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase (RRT-PCR).
The results are generally available within a few hours until 2 days.
The test of reaction in chain of polymerase with inverse transcriptase performed with pharmaceutical hisops is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the garage, but it is still multiplying in the lungs.
In persons infected in which the test is performed in the second week, as alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory roads through suction category, or it can be used for the material that is exposed to the toser (esputo).
One of the first tests of polymerase reaction was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the reverse reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase in real time (RRT-PCR), and was the base of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (OMS).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company of Korea developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical polymerase reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Looking for the gene "E" for all the betacoronavirus and the specific RdRp gen of SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies in obtaining the use of emergency use of the National Medical Production of China from a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the reaction of polymerase. In the United States, the Centres for Control and Prevention of Patients (CDC) are distributing their diagnostic reaction panel with inverse transcriptase in real time for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health steroids through the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated unconcluded results due to defective reactions, and an attack in the performance of tests in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, averagely, there were less than 100 samples per day during all February 2020.
The confidentiality of the tests used by two components has not been determined until 28 February 2020, and only since then it was permitted that the state and local tests begin to be performed.
Food and medicines adopted the test under the authorisation of use of emergency, and the United States Commercial Affairs began to test at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationality of the tests for the COVID-19 based on the reaction of the polymerase with inverse transcriptase.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, This Diagnostics provided tests for COVID-19 at national level.
No limits were declared in the quantity; the collection of speeds and processing should be performed in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the test for the COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Medical Preservation. On 12 March 2020, it was informed that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for a test that could be performed within a period of 3,5 hours in large volume, which allowed a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the authorisation for use of emergency for Abbott Laboratories for a test in the Abbott 2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the authorisation of the FDA to use emergency for a test that remains about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the isotermic enhancement technology of nuclear acids instead of polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not repeat a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are approximately 18 000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott intends to increase the production to perform 50 000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is developed using a monocloneal anticorps that is specifically a protein of the nucleocapside (protein N) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that it can provide results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as a quick test for influenza.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "Torax radiografies have little diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of the TC [computated tomography] can be obtained even before the appearance of symptoms".
Typical characteristics in the TC include bilateral multilateral opacity in delighted glass with periferic, asymetrical and later distribution.
As the disease progresses, sub-pleural domination, empire pattern and consolidation is developed.
It is a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemy, in which the reaction of polymerase was compared to computerized tomography, computerised tomography is much more sensitive than the reaction of polymerase, even less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images correspond to the processes of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "not using computerized tomography as a detection method or as a test of first line for the COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDCs recommend the reaction in the stream of polymerase as a initial examination.
A part of the reaction of the immune system to the infection is the production of anticorps, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect the infection on persons around 7 days after the symptoms appearance, to determine immunity and monitoring of the population. They can be analysed in central or through tests at the point of attention.
Automatized high performance systems in many clinical areas can perform these analyses, but their ability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central analysis analysis, one peripheric blood species is usually used, although serious species can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single blood species is generally obtained by a punction in the skin.
On 26 March 2020, the FDA designed 29 persons who provided a notice to the agency as corresponding and now can distribute its anti-corps tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an authorization of emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnosis and Epitope Diagnoss received the approval of Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundreds of samples during the hours and therefore is much faster than the conventional test of reaction in the range of virus RNA polymerase.
At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom discovered that no of the anti-corps test kits that he bought was enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program where suspicious patients can remain in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for species," the patient split in the tube, sends it and receives a result at a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot programme to analyze the suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient infections others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disfect an ambulance if one is used. In tests in Drive-through centres for the COVID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes with appropriate precautions.
The Drive-through centres have helped South Korea to make some of the fastest and more tests of any country. In Germany, the National Medical Health Safety Association said on 2 March that he had a capacity for approximately 12 000 tests per day in the ambulatory environment and that 10 700 people had been tested in the previous week.
Health insurance takes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
It is the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a general capacity to make 160 000 tests per week.
On 19 March, tests were offered through the driver-through system in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests made in Germany was unknown because only the positive results were reported.
One first study of §s showed that at the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples were analysed, including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6,9 %) made positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers of the Institute Technion and Hospital Rambam were developed and tried a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping the samples and only to make more analysis if the combined sample results are positive. On February 2020, Wuhan, the BGI included an improvised emergency detection of 2000 squared metres called "Huo-Yan" (Chine: ­ ­ ­, ­, ́, or "Fire Eye" in English), which could be processed more than 10 000 per day.
With the building, which was monitored by the BGI founder, Wang Jian, and who took five days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% greater and that the relevant cost to confront the Quarentane had been duplicated without this ability to perform tests.
After Wuhan's Property, Huo-Yan was immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjen, Pekín and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50.000 tests per day. Manufactured multi-open source designs provided by origami analysis that allow to evaluate up to 1122 patients samples for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small intervals without need to use liquid manipulation robots.
For March, massive tests in the European Union and the United States have been affected by the escape and the insufficient amounts of reactions.
This led to some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve to calm the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN genes to make more tests. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now making more tests of detection of coronavirus per person in their population than any other country, and was encouraging to increase the level of tests for the majority of the population.
This has been achieved by combining the driver-through capacity and purchasing a massive production capacity at the level of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on its emergency detections "Huo-Yan" in China).
Constructed in 14 days, it has ability to perform decades of thousands of reaction tests in chain of polymerase with inverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different forms of tests have been developed by different parts of the genetic coronavirus profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits that sent to low income countries that had no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the Protocol developed by the United States Control and Prevention Centres was not available until 28 January, and the tests available in the United States were lost. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the broadband, and these countries and the countries could not provide enough kits to satisfy the request and recommendations of health experts on tests.
In contrast, experts say that the majority of South Korea's tests helped to reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean Government achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sectors, during several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programmes such as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemy. The high request of tests due to the broad spread of the virus caused a loss of hundreds of thousand tests in the United States Private Auditors, and the supplies of hisopates and chemical reactions were lost.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the precision of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the Government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had avoided the implementation of private tests. Spain buyed test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but had unexpected results.
The company explained that the wrong results could be given to the wrong collection of tests or wrong use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would remove the kits that broke wrong results and replace them by a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought to China did wrong results. Slovakia bought 1,2 million kits in China which resulted in impression.
The Prime Minister Matovicz suggested that they be thrown into Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Health Minister, said that the test kits that Turkey bought to China had a "high error rate" and they did not "leave them in use". The United Kingdom bought 3,5 million kits of tests to China, but at the beginning of April 2020 announced that they were not serving.
The performance of tests, complied with the quarantine of those who received positive results and the identification of those with whom they had contacted those who had given a positive in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the place where the first death of COVID-19 in Italy occurred, performed two rounds of tests throughout the population of about 3400 people, with about ten days of divergence.
The half of those who received positive results had no symptoms, and all detected cases were in quarter.
With the limitation of travel in the municipality, this has completely removed the new infections.
With the intensive stream of contacts, the restraints of travel from outside, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus 2020 pandemy in Singapore avan much less than in other developed countries, but that did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the closed closure of Restaurants and minorist institutions.
Many events were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore eated to recommend residents who remained in their homes, but schools again opened after the dinner of 23 March.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemy with the intensive stream of contacts, the restrictions of travel from outside, tests and quarters, but with less extreme limitations such as Iceland and South Korea.
It is a statistical study, countries who have made more evidence, in relation to the number of deaths, have less letality rates for cases, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who have only light symptoms or who do not have symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries who do not have capabilities for testing and have national experiences with limited experience in the COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to some of the 16 OMS reference tests.
From the 16 references, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Âa.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of tests" column is affected by the country's testing policy.
A country that only performs evidence in hospitals will have a higher number of tests as % of tests than a country that makes evidence in all citizens, whether or not, the other issues are equal.
The lavage of hands, also known as hygiene of hands, is the action to lay hands with the purpose of eliminating suicide, grass, micro-essential or other undetermined substances.
The lavage of hands with jabon constantly in certain "critic moments" during the day predicts the propagation of many diseases, such as diarree and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal-oral way.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common refrigeration, for example, if they do not lay their hands before they touch the eyes, narrow or mouth (e.g. mucose membranes).
The five critical moments during the day in which it is important to lay hands with jabon include: before and after defect, after having taken a child's cow or changing pannales, before eating a child, before eating and before and after preparing a food or manipulating cruel, fished or bird meat.
If there is no water or jabón, hands can be made with census. The World Health Organization recommends to lay hands:
Ants, while and after preparing food.
Annes and after care for a person.
After switching the balls, or to make a kid who used the bathroom.
After the narrow sounds, tosser or sternur.
After playing animals, food for animals or animal waste.
The medical hygiene of hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
The lavage of hands before taking medicines or medical attention can prevent or minimize the propagation of diseases.
The main medical goal of the hand lavage is to remove patogens (bacteria, virus or other microscope that may cause a disease) and chemical substances that may cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also a important practice for the general public.
The lavading of hands has many benefits for health, including minimising the propagation of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing diarrea infectious causes; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in the births in the house.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand-laving practices can generate small improvements in the growth of children less than five years.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by the introduction of simple changes in the behavior, such as laying hands with jabon.
This simple action can reduce almost 50% the mortality rate for these diseases.
The interventions promoting the lavading of hands can reduce diarrhee episodes in a third part around, and this is similar to providing potential water in low income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhee episodes can be related to the lavading of hands with jabon. The lavage of hands with jabon is the most effective and economic way to prevent the diarrhoea and adequate respiratory infections, such as automatic behaviour adopted in the homes, schools and communities of the world.
Neumonia, an important aggressive respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children less than five years, and life is covered by a estimated amount of 1,8 million children per year.
The diarree and neumonia together represent almost 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
It is UNICEF, converting hand lavage with jabon before eating and after using the bathroom in a broken habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half the deaths by diarree and a fourth part of the deaths by appealing respiratory infections.
Manufacturing is generally integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, health and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The lavage of hands also protects the impeticity, which is transmitted to the direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of the lavage of hands is that its frequent performance may cause cutting damage due to the skin resequence.
It is a Danish study conducted in 2012, the hand-sufficient lavado may cause a cutanal affliction that causes pizazon and makes the skin renewed as an echema of hands or dermatitis, which is especially frequent in healthy workers.
The lavage of hands too frequent is also considered one of the symptoms of the compulsive disturbance (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when the lavage of hands with jabon is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (ornar, defecter), after the cow of a child (switching pannales), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or manipulating cruel, fished meat or bird meat.
Other times in which a right hand lavage technology should be practiced to prevent the transmission of diseases includes before and after treatment of a court or an injury; after heating, tossing or sounding the narrow; after touching animal waste or manipulating animals; and after tough.
In many countries, there is a low rate of lavading hands with jabon.
A study on the lavage of hands in 54 countries made in 2015 concluded that 38.7% of the families practiced in average hands with jabon. In 2014, a study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97%; the United States was near the half of a 77%; and China had the lowest rate with 23%. Currently, there are several methods for the change of behaviour, to increase the adoption of the habit of laying hands with jabon at critical times. The lavading of hands in the group of children at the school at some time of the day is a option in developing countries to incorporate hands in the behavior of children.
The "Genial Healthcare Programme" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a measured action to promote children ' s health and education.
Two times per year, rather than laying hands with jabbon every day, cheaping dinners by day with fluorure, are the basis of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of micros from the skin improves when adds to jabon or detergent water.
The main action of jabons and detergents is to reduce the barriers for solution and to increase solvency.
The only water results ineffective to cover the skin because grass and proteins, which are components of the organic material, are not easily solved in the water.
However, a reasonable water flow facilitates the heat.
The solid jabbon, due to its reusable nature, may contain therms purchased in the previous uses.
Some studies that analysed the transfer of solid contaminated jabón have concluded that the transfer is small, since the slips are injured.
Yet, CDC's that "is preferable for liquid jabbin with controls for dispensation that do not involve use of hands".
Antibacterian jabons have been intensely promoted for a conscious health public.
Currently, there are no evidence that show that use of the recommended defectants or antiseptics preserves antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterian jabons contain common antibacterian agents, such as triclosan, which has a list of resistent organisms.
In this way, even though antibacterian jabons do not preserve antibiotic ceps, they may not be as effective as promoted.
Besides the surfacting agent and protecting the skin, sophisticated forms may contain acids (acetic acid, asylum, milk acid) and pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobian activity and more accommodators for skin (real, vitamins, mentols, vegetables extractes). A exhaustive analysis of the Public Health School of the University of Oregon indicated that the common jabons are so effective as the antibacterian jabons for the consumer containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate the disorders of hands.
The warm water is not enough to remove the hands.
The temperature grows much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, the jabonous water is more efficient than the cald jabonous water to eliminate the natural oil that covers the earth and the therms.
However, contrary to popular faith, scientist studies have shown that use of tissue water does not affect the reduction of microbian load in hands.
A desinfektor for hands or antiseptical for hands is an unwaterless agent for the hygiene of hands.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the XXI century, the hygiene agents of the hands without water and with alcohol to frote (also known as a solution for alcohol based on hands to float, antiseptic solution for hands for floating or disinfecting for hands) began to buy popularity.
The majority is based on isopropylic alcohol or ethanol formed with a specifying agent as a carbon (acryl acid polymetric) in a gel, or a humetic like glucerin in a liquid, or spume for easy use and to reduce alcohol resistance effects.
Addition of diluid peroxide increases the antimicrobian activity. Desinfektors for hands containing between 60 and 95% of alcohol at least eliminate the heat effectively.
Alcohol-based defectives eliminate therapy, resistant therapy to several medicines (SARM and ERV), from tuberculosis and some virus ( HIV, herpes, VSR, renovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and hungs.
Alcohol disinfektors for frote containing 70% of alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, compared to 35 decibel reduction) of hands in 30 seconds after the application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithmes) of the hands in 1 minute after the application. The defectives for hands are more effective against some virus and less effective.
Desinfektors for alcohol-based hands are almost ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most frequent cause of the county gastroenteritis. It should be used enough solution for antiseptical hands or on the basis of alcohol to float, such as to humide or cover both hands completely.
The palm and the dust of both hands, between the fingers and the extremes of all fingers, are frozen for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, the spume or the gel are seated.
The points of the fingers should also be laid well, frot them in both palms. The United States’ Control and Prevention Centres recommend the lavage of hands before disinfektors for hands to blow, especially when the hands are very swimming.
The increased use of these agents is based on their use facility and the rapid elimination activity of micro-emission; however, it should not be used as a replacement of the suitable lavate by hands except that there is no water or jabon.
Common use of defectants for alcohol-based hands may cause the skin to be cut, except added emolient or attracting to the skin to the formula.
The alcohol sequence effect can be reduced or removed by adding glucerin or other emolynts to the formula.
In clinical trials, defectives for alcohol-based hands that contain emolients caused irritation and sequence of skin to be considered less than antimicrobian jabons or detergents.
The allergic dermatitis per contact, the urticaria syndrome per contact or hyper-equity or the additives presented in the solutions for alcohol-based hands are very few.
The smallest trend to provoke irritant dermatitis by contact resulted attractive in comparison with water and jabon lavating hands.
Despite their efficiency, without water agents do not remove the organic material from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, disinfektors for hands are not so effective as water and jabón to prevent the propagation of many patogens, since patogens remain in their hands.
The efficiency of defectants for non-alcoolless hands depends largely on ingredients and the formula, as well as historically, has been much less than alcohol and alcohol solutions based on floating.
Recently, the formulaes used by benzalconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobian activity after application, in contrast to alcohol, whose efficiency decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low income communities can't buy jabon and use in changing census or land.
The censes or the earth can be more effective than the water alone, but less effective than the jabon.
Anxiety is that, if the land or census are contaminated with microems, this can increase the propagation of diseases instead of decreasing it.
Like the jabon, the census is also a defective agent, since, in contact with water, forms a alcohol solution.
The OMS recommended use of census or sand as an alternative to jabon when no jabon is available.
The right hand lavage technique recommended by the United States Control and Prevention Centres to prevent the transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Moving hands with thick or cold water.
The running water is recommended because water recipients can be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to be no difference.
Froot hands to form a spume with a generous quantity of jabbon, including hands' darkness, between fingers and under the wheels.
The jabone removes the skin warms, and the studies indicate that people are laughing their hands at least when they use jabone than when they use water alone.
Return for at least 20 seconds.
Restressing creates friction, which helps to remove the skin heat heat, and to restrict for longer periods eliminate more heat.
Smoking well with running water.
Injury in a recipient can be contaminated again.
Sleep with a toilet or leave to dry in the air.
Small and mosqued hands return to contaminate with easierness. The parts that are more frequently living are the powder, the moon, the areas between the fingers and below the wings
Artrificial wings and smelt of discashed wings can locate micro.
Commonly, humid lotion is recommended to avoid re-sequence of hands; thick skin may cause cut damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate the lavading of hands when there is no running water or jabon, for example, seeing water from a covered wheel or a calabasy with close or use of census if necessary in developing countries. In the areas where there is a limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to enhance water, such as "master griffs" and other economic options.
A casher griff is a simple technology that consists of using a suspense jara from a soga and a pawn with the foot to see a small quantity of water on the hands and a jabbin in the bar.
The effective seed of hands is a essential part of the hygiene process of hands, but there is a certain debate on the way of more efficient sugar in public bathrooms.
Each time, the research indicates that paper toilets are much more hygiene than hand-sectors in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, patrocinated by the European Tisue Symposium paper to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper toiletes, warm air-scanners and the more modern air-blanked hands sequencers.
After wearing and slinging hands with the warm air sequencer, it was found that the total amount of halts increased in average 194 per cent in the fingers and 254 per cent in the palms.
Sealing with the air-blank sealer has resulted in a average increase in the average amount of 42 % in fingers and 15 % in palms.
After wearing and slinging hands with a paper toilet, the total amount of rubbers reduced, in average, a 76 per cent in the fingers and a 77 per cent in the palms. Scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was a crushed contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of sugar method.
The air flower, which surfaces air from the unit to speed, isside 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), has been able to surface the micro-emissions of the hands and the unit and, possibly, to contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 metres.
The use of a warm air trailer propagated the microems up to 0.25 metres away from the sequence.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Environment, various methods of sealing of hands were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the summary of hands after the seat of hands:
There are many manufacturers of different hands sequencers, and hand sequencers have been compared to the seed with paper toilets.
Laying hands with disinfecting toilets for hands is an alternative during the travels, when there is no water or jabon.
The deinfectant for alcohol based hands must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The lavage of the doctor’s hands became mandatory very much after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficiency (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind members of the hospital staff who lay their hands when they live.
A study tested a decrease of the infection rates with its use.
The lavage of the doctor’s hands is made at least for 15 seconds, with quantity of water and jabon or gel to form spume and restrict all the parts of the hands.
The hands should be restrained together by tracing the fingers.
If there are residues below the wheels, a wheel pill can be used to remove them.
Since the Germans can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to hurt them well and throw them with a toilet.
After the seed, the paper toilet should be used to close the water (and open any output door if necessary).
This avoids the hands to be contaminated by these surfaces.
The purpose of lavading hands in the medical care environment is to remove the patogenic micro-masters and avoid transmitting them.
See New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand lavage still exists at unacceptable levels in most of the medical environments, where many doctors and doctors usually are invited to lave their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microems.
A study showed that the right lavage of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of infections of the blood torrent related to category in 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet in which the hand lavage and standard hand fraction in the medical care sectors is shown.
The preliminary version of the guide for the hygiene of the organization can also be found on your website so that the public can make comments.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Trade devices may measure and verify the hygiene of the hands if the demonstration of the regulatory compliance is repeated.
The World Health Organization has "five minutes" for the lavage of hands:
after the exposure to blood or body liquids
before an aseptic work and
Following patients. The aggregation of antiseptical chemical products in the jabon (medicinales) or "antibacterian) gives you the possibility of elimination to the hand lavado agent.
This elimination may be necessary before a surgery or environment where the antibiotics are very frequently resistant organisms. To lay hands before a chirurgical operation, it is necessary to count with a griff that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a little of chlorhexid or yodo for the lavade, sterilized towels to cut off the hands after the lavade, a sterilized cepille to breathe and another sterilized instrument to be stucked under the wheels.
All the shoes must be removed.
This procedure repeatedly lays hands and pre-breaks up to the cost, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to lay for a long time (10 minutes).
When they are injured, the water of the pre-breaks should be avoided.
After the lavage, the hands are cut off with a sterilized bread and a chirurgical bath is placed.
To reduce the spread of warmen, it is better to lay hands or use an antiseptical for hands before and after taking attention to people.
In order to control the infections caused by staphilococs in hospitals, the highest benefit of hand-lease is in the first 20% of the lavade and is very little additional benefit when the hygiene frequency increases more than 35%.
The lavado with common jabón gives more of the triple of infections transmissible to food compared to the lavado with antibacterian jabón. In comparison with the lavage of hands with a alcohol-based solution with the lavage of hands with an antibacterian jabbon for a average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the frozen with alcohol reduced 26% more the contamination of the antibacterian than the antibacterian jabone.
However, water and jabón are more effective to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium difficult speeds of the hands that defectives for alcohol-based hands. Interactions to improve hygiene in health care centres can include the staff on hand lavading, increase defectiveness for hands based on alcohol and oral memories to the staff.
More information is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective areas of health care.
In developing countries, the lavage of hands with jabon is a economic and fundamental tool to achieve good health and even good food.
However, the lack of a confidential water supply, jabons or installations to lay hands in homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge to achieve universal lavading conduct.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, there are very few griffs to lay hands near public or private retrets, although there are economic options to build hand lavage stations.
However, the low lavage rates of hands may also be the result of accumulated habits and not the lack of jabon or water.
The promotion of the lavage of hands with jabon can affect political decisions, increase consciousness on the benefits of hand-laving and cause a long-term behaviour of the population.
In order to effectively function, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that Community approaches are effective to increase the lavage of hands in the PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promotion of hand lavading at schools is the "Tree Stars" approach of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students lave their hands with jabon, including hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one a, finally, three stars.
Construction of hand lavading stations can be part of the campaigns for the promotion of hand lavading that are carried forward to reduce the diseases and child mortality.
The World Day of Lavado de Manos is another example of consciousness campaign that is trying to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the coronavirus pandemy 2019-2020, UNICEF stimulated the creation of an emosion for the lavading of hands.
A few studies have considered the general rentalability of hand-laving in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that the promotion of hands with jabon is considered more effective than other water and health interventions.
The importance of lavading hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who just were born or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized by the middle of the 20th century by two hand hygiene pillars: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "the founder of modern heritage".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by disadvantaged mismas.
In 1980, the broadcasting of diseases transmitted by food and health care infections led to the United States Control and Prevention Centres to promote the hygiene of hands more actively as an important way to prevent infection propagation.
In 2009 and COVID-19 pandemy, in 2020, made more conscious about the importance of laying hands with jabon to protect them from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, "righteous techniques to lay hands" were covered by the lavabs of the public bathrooms and the bathrooms of the offices and ports buildings.
The phrase "laving hands" is a statement that you don't want to be charged of something or to make the complication of something.
He has its origin in Matthew’s Bible passage in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but it has become a much larger use phrase in some English communities.
In Macbeth of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began to laugh his hands in compulsively in an attempt to make a little imaginary, which represents her consciousness of faults that he had committed and who had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been checked that after remembering or reflecting non-ethical actions, people are able to lay their hands most often than others and are worth more the elements for the lavage of hands.
Furthermore, those who have allowed their hands to laugh after such reflection have less probability of involved in other compensatory actions, such as a voluntary.
Religions recommend the lavage of hands for hygiene and simbiotic purposes. The lavage of symbiotic hands, with water, but without jabone, is part of the ritual lavage of hands in many religions, such as the blazing, the hinduism, the tevil and the netilat yadayim in the Jewishism, the lavatorium in the Christianism and wudu in the islam. Religions also recommend the lavage of hygiene hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam are forced to lay hands after going to the bathroom.
And the Hinduism, Buddhism, Sychism, Jewishism and Islam are forced to lay hands before and after each food.
Risk controls in the workplace before COVID-19
risk controls in the workplace before COVID-19 refer to the implementation of hygiene and occupational safety methods in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate risk controls at the workplace and workplace and are based on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers that can be intended to oppose COVID-19.
The security and employment health (OSHA) of the United States, jobs with less exposure risk have a minimum working contact with the public and the employees, for which are advised measures to prevent basic infections, including the lavage of hands, the recommendation of workers to stay home if they are low, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of deficiency and defect of the work environment.
Works with average exposure risk include those in which frequent or nearby contact with people who do not know or doubt that they have COVID-19, but who could be infected by the existing Community transmission or by a international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with many concentrations of people and some large minority sales environments.
The risk controls for this group, as well as the measures for the prevention of basic infections, include ventilation with high air filters, protective and individual protection equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers that workers of health care and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or are suspicious of COVID-19, have a high risk of exhibition, which increases very highly if they can generate procedures in persons who are known or doubt that they have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these persons.
Adequate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protection equipment closed to work activity.
COVID-19 breaks may have various consequences on the workplace.
Workers may miss the work because they have to take care of others or fear of the possible exhibition.
Trade patrons may change, both in respect of what goods are requested and the mechanisms for the acquisition of such goods (as buying in hours that are not picked, by transport services to house or by window from the car).
Finally, the sending of articles from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A preparation and response plan can be used for infectious diseases to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the risk levels related to various workshops and workshops, including exposure sources, risk factors that occur from home and Community environments and individual workers' risk factors, such as cronical medical diseases.
They also describe the controls necessary to cope with those risks and contingency plans for breeding.
Preparation and response plans to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Among the objectives of the response to a broadcast, it is included to reduce the transmission between staff members, to protect those who have a greater risk of suffering of adverse health complications, to maintain commercial operations and to minimize the side effects of their supply chains.
The severity of disease in the community where the company is affected by the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a broadly used framework for hygiene and occupational safety to classify risk controls is its effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be removed, the most effective controls are the engineering controls followed by the administrators and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolation of employees of the risks related to work without recycling the behavior of workers and may be the most rentable solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in policies or working procedures that react to worker or employer's action.
Individual protection equipment are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of individual protective equipment should be selected in accordance with the risk for the worker, placed as corresponding (e.g. respirators), properly and systemically used, frequently revised, received maintenance, replaced if necessary and removed, stored and refused to not contaminate.
United States Health and Employment Safety (OSHA) is held, work with less exposure risks have minimum work contact with the public and the employees.
The measures for the prevention of basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces include the deep and frequent lavage of hands, the recommendation for workers to stay home if possible, the standards of respiratory hygiene which include to be covered by the tosser and sternering, the provision of paper and containers for losses, the preparation for telephone or scaled turns, if necessary, the disobeyment of workers to use agenous tools and equipment and the maintenance of a routine of hardness and defect of the workshop.
The identification and isolation of people who can be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The Centers for the Control and Prevention of Sickness (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of aggressive respiratory disease remain in their homes until they stop having fever, fever signs and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medicines to allocate the symptoms or decrease the fever; that the license policies by disease are flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a family, and that employees know these policies.
The OSHA is a median exposure risk work includes those who re-frequently or nearly contact at least six feet (1,8 m) with people who do not know nor doubt that they have COVID-19, but who could have been contacted with SARS-CoV-2 due to the Community transmission of the time around the location of the company, or because the person has recently made a international journey to a place with a generalized transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working areas with a lot of people and some smaller sales areas. Engineering controls for this group and higher risk groups include the installation of highlight air filters, the increase in ventilation rate, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protection facilities and the establishment of a window for the care service that the client may request from the car. The administrative controls for this group and the higher risk groups include recommending employees staying in the house, replaced preliminary workshops, and promoted by public communications, establishing a high-scale tournament, suspending the ways that the customer may not be able to work from the car.
Workers of this group of rare risks should use respirators.
If a person is in a plane, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the person from others to a distance of 6 feet, designing a member of the tripulation to attain the person and offer a mask to the person or ask him to cover the mouth and the narrow with paper paints when he touches or is insane.
The cabin tripulation must use unexpected chirurgical guants to attract a passenger or to touch body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and maybe individual protection equipment if the passenger has fever, your persistent or difficulty to breathe.
In the case of commercial navigation, such as passagers and other ships transporting passengers, risk controls include traveling by disease, self-isolation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms while he is on board.
The ideal is that medical control is made in the cabin of the person’s ais. In the case of schools and children's care centres, CDCs recommend closing short-term to make or defect if a infected person was in the school building, independent of the Community transmission.
When Community transmission is minimum or moderate, social distance strategies, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other massive meetings, such as physical or core education classs or foods in the eating, increased space between puppers, scaling income and out time, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for the health room for children with gripal symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, as well as social distance strategy, it can be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For the staff of the police forces carried out daily routine activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk for health is low.
The police officers are recommended to contact people who have a confirmed diagnosis or suspects of COVID-19 that follow the same patterns as medical emergency techniques, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is a close contact during a detention, workers must stumble and defect their workshop and their equipment with a sol or household toilet before they return to use them and follow the standard operational procedure for the content and delay of the personal protection team and content and clothing of clothing.
The OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are within high or very high risk of exposure categories.
Among high-exposition risk works are the employers of delivery, support, and medical transport exposed to patients with confirmed diagnostics or suspects of COVID-19.
These are being very high exposure risk works if workers perform solar generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnostics or suspicions of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some processes of generation of soles are intuition, induction procedures, broncopics, some dental procedures and tests or invasive tests.
High exhibition risk jobs include those in which workers are involved in preparing the COVID-19 and who were suspicioned that they could have it at the time of death; they would have a very high exposure risk if they did autopsia. Additional engineering controls for those groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnostic or suspicions of COVID-19, even when they are conducted in the process of generation of soles.
Specialised ventilation with negative pressure may be added in some medical and morgue care environments.
The samples should be manipulated by taking precautions on Biosecurity level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the patients who enter into a different expectation room separate themselves from whether they may be suspicious or not to have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of maskers for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet of the patients who have been counted or doubted that they have been complied with SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform solar generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators should be used with NIOSH or higher filter maskers in the context of a written integral respiratory program including adjustment tests, employment and medical examinations.
Other types of maskers can cause a greater protection and improve worker's comfort. The WMS does not recommend the use of protector monos, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by corporate fluids.
The OMS only recommends the use of a chirurgical mask for the incoming patient classification staff.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, they take care or transport them without making processes of generation of soles, the OMS recommends the use of chirurgical maskery, furniture or face protection, battle and guantes.
If a process of generation of soles is performed, the chirurgical mascarilla should be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of personal protection equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends to minimize the need to use them, replace them by telemedicin, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limitation of income permission to the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct attention, the use of the same maskless without repairing it while cares for several patients with the same diagnostic, monitoring and coordination of the provision of personal protection equipment and dealing with the use of maskers by asintomatic people.

COUNT: [Covid-19] Align the load and prepare us for the future
FILE/WORK: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICEN日: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in natural circumstances.
The Epidemy of the COVID-19 shows our human interconnection at global level and the responsibility we have one to another.
The challenges presented have no responsibility, but we know that our best radical response in empathy, cooperation and the global Community building that comply with the nuclear of this organization.
The companion and concern we have seen among all our companions in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible people are those with whom we have the happiness to work.
I couldn't feel more thankful and proud that you all are my companions.
Last week, someone made me the appreciation he felt for our work.
I remembered how important it is for the world to reach Wikipedia at this moment and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available for all.
Your work makes this possible, whether to keep the sites in work, to help our companions receive their payment or to maintain without our communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but the way we do it will have a deep effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, since this next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjust to our work and our cronograms
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C team met last night to talk about our approach and our cronogramme for the next days and months.
In this conversation, we consider what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are doing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
Moreover, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce the speed, it's okay.
For all staff, contracts and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until the next warning.
We don't declare a feritage; if you can work in a more normal time, this would be greatly useful for the mission.
However, the world is currently an impecable place, and if you need to care for your dear ones, to purchase or to go to the doctor, our priority is your welfare.
We don't take the account of your hours.
If it's done, it's not working.
Although I shouldn't have to say that, we say it.
It is not necessary to request a license for illness or free time; only report to its manager and help your team to review the calendars and cronograms to ensure that the key areas of the work are strict.
(If you receive a positive diagnose from COVID-19, warn Bryan from T&C Operations so that T&C can help with support and ensure that the management is both in its situation).
People who work for hour will receive the total payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment with our contractors and partners who work for hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours working in normal circumstances.
This also applies if it is and can't work.
If he wants to work, he has our support.
Many people use the work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incrediblely gratifying, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we ask them is that they communicate with their manager so that we know what to wait and we can adapt ourselves correctly.
Some works are considered essential.
There are some things we should keep doing.
The Engineering Teams for Sites Confidentiality, Human Resource Operations, Confidentiality and Security and Fund Recovery, inter alia, perform a critical work that could require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and amend our approach to support what is essential for our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we all will focus on the most important projects.
Reducing speed today will not hurt us tomorrow.
We are not planning to "duplicate the hours to put us on the day" when the pandemy ends.
It will not be expected to work extra hours to comply with terms that are not more realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to establish new objectives and terms when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adapt to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the cronogram for delivery of our annual planning 2020-2012.
Our intention is to propose a plan of 2019-2020 to provide more time for the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care of dear ones while we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced time during the next weeks.
This presentation of our cronogramme is greatly reduced by the current planning and pressure loads throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal before the Council the next week and we will communicate the next steps to the delegates and teams we have only a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and office
Last week we heard that one of our companions from the Office of San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a measure of precaution, we have contracted an antiviral team to defect all the surfaces of the Office of San Francisco.
They used an antiviral hospital use solution to desinfect all surfaces, as well as receipt and ascensors that go to our stage.
The building has adopted its own responsibility protocol, using products supporting the safety of its employees.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has made its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all the staff members in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has transferred its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the customs with San Francisco.
As some of our companions in New York have already known, we have also spoken about achieving a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still running, but it is possible to remain.
Some of our companions work remotely for the first time.
Our companions who already worked remotely know that this mode reacts to an adjustment, thus the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings at one or two hours as maximum.
If longer, consider the way of segregating them in the course of several days.
Defines clearly the dictionary with a list of themes and sends reading materials with precipient.
Accept the use of the video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and living connection.
Design a leader to modify each person, a person who controls the questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or take notes cooperatively).
Send a email message to technical support if you need comfortable audiculars.
Use the refund for refrigerators.
Use the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your companions about distributed work
The RR Operations Team HH. is analyzing the broadcasts based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week, we asked all Community subventions beneficiaries to cancel the public events financed by Wikimedia, such as the editors, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemy.
We reported them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could unable to comply with its part of the activities agreed for the subvention and that there would be no sanctions for the delay or change of these objectives.
This next week we will follow additional pounds in Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at global level seems to be partly triumphed by interruption and, in part, delighted by clarity and ability to focus on its own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Furthermore, the CRT will work to set a page in Meta-Wiki to burn a space to the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep contact with COVID-19 issues
We'll send you a invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 h, a coordinated universal time/07:00 h, a time of 日, for a special responsibility of the staff.
We will use this opportunity to make additional news, answer your questions and pass time Connect us together.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this e-mail message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will maintain these updated pages and all information on one place.
We also work to maintain regular communications with the staff living in countries that are currently very affected.
If you have any question on travels, events, important work flows, any covering problem or anything you can need help, you do not doubt to notify the CRT and work with them.
We're here to help brake support and work as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or criminal matters, send a mail message to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
No of these changes should be considered as a abandon of our work and our obligations.
Instead of this, it is a recognition that our work and our obligations are likely to be adapted in a way that has not happened before.
These are the measures we believe needed to support us mutually so that we can continue working, give our movement the necessary support and provide the service he trusts to the world.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support us mutually and to make place for the important work that will come in the next weeks and, possibly, in the next months.
We need all of you so that this may be possible, and therefore we need you to care and care for your families so that you can find yourself in the best possible state when the need comes.
Now, please, get your hands up and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the team of leadership (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jaime V, Jaene U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converting enzyme of angiotensine 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the external surface (cellal memories) of the lung cells, arterias, hearts, renes and intestines.
ECA2 contrarys the activity of angiotensine (ECA) to reduce the amount of angiotensin II and to increase angiotensin (1-7), which converts it into a therapeutic dina for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of input to cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 is a metaloenzime containing zinc and is located on the surface of endotelial cells and other types.
ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal carriage of amino acids of collectrine.
ECA2 is an unipased membrane protein of type I, with its enzymaticly active domination exposed on the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular dominion of the ECA2 is scandined from the transmembranal dominion by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the solution protein is released in the bloody torrent and, in the last instance, is excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most of the bodies: ECA2 is mainly adhered to the cell membrane of the type II pulmonary cells of the pulmonary cells, to the enterotics of the degradated intestin, to venous artery and endotelial cells and to the arterial cells of the liso muscle of most of the bodies.
The MARN expression of ECA2 is also located in the brain cortez, the stretched body, the hypotalam and the enefalic tronch.
The main function of ECA2 is to oppose ECA.
The ECA cut the angiotensine I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstructive.
At its time, ECA2 cuts the carboxyl-terminal phenilalanine amino acid of angiotensine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and it isolated to form vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also eliminate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apeline, neurotensine, dinorphine A and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membranes from the SLC6A19 neutro-amino acid transporter and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As transmembran protein, ECA2 serves as the main input point for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus caused by SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus caused by COVID-19).
More specifically, the association of the SRS-CoV spy protein and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme dominion of ECA2 on the surface of the cells has the result of endocitosis and transmission of the virus together with the enzyme to the endsomes within the cells.
This input process also repeated the preparation of protein S by the gas protease series TMPRSS2, which is currently investigating as possible therapy. This has led to certain possibilities that reduction of ECA2 levels in cells could help combat the infection.
However, several professional and regulatory associations have recommended to continue ECA and BRA inhibitor .
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 determined that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34 % of the risk of neumony compared to control cases".
Moreover, "the risk of neumony was also reduced in patients receiving treatment with ECA inhibitors and having a higher risk of neumony, especially those with brainbrovascular accident and cardiac insuficiency.
The use of ECA inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction of the mortality related to neumony, although the results were not so strong for the general risk of neumony."
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) seems to be a new treatment for aggressive pulmonary lease and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in lechons with acute respiratory difficulty induced by lipopolisacarides.
The average life of the rhECA2 in human beings is about 10 hours and the start of the action is 30 minutes, besides the 24-hour effect (duration).
Some findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promised medicine for those people with intolerance to the classic inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (SRA inhibitors) or in the diseases in which angiotensine II is high. Infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of angry respiratory difficulty syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help with contact trace in response to the coronavirus pandemy of 2019-2020, which is the process of identifying people ("contakts") that could have been in contact with a county person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the Government in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several frames have been developed for the creation of contact trace applications.
Anxieties related to privacy have been raised, in particular, in relation to systems based on the trace of the geographical location of the users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to register the closeness of a user to other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google announced jointly that they would integrate the functionality to admit these applications based on Bluetooth directly on their operating systems iOS and Android.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore you are using an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by a local community of TI, launched as an open code application and sentenced to the government. In North, "StopKorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to trace the exposure to potentially counted persons and a rapid response to health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Minister for Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On 14 April 2020, the application was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government informed that the application of contact trace was in a progressive development stage and that it would be available for its implementation in the next weeks. It was planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
So much as New Zealand are considering applications based on the application of TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol in Singapur. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetrage application for patients living in Moscow and have received a COVID-19 diagnostic designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering of the University of Cambri's University, expressed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including positive and possible failure of efficiency if the adoption of application is only limited to a small part of the population.
In response to concerns on the propagation of "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add applications relating to coronavirus in its App Store to "official" or trust only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of the massive monitoring to the applications of the coronavirus and, in particular, if the infrastructure created to lead to the coronavirus pandemy once the threat occurs.
International Amnistia and more than 100 other organizations have submitted a communication to limit this type of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
the monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportional";
the enlargement of monitoring and monitoring should have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to the COVID-19;
security and anonymate should be protected and should be evidence of this protection;
digital monitoring should avoid exhausting discrimination and marginalisation;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protection against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens to respond to that abuse;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Fronters (Reporter without Limit, RSF) of Germany also published control lists.
The plan proposed by Google/日e intends to address the problem of persistent monitoring by removeing the tracking mechanism from your operational systems when you do not need it anymore.
In some countries, a trace of network-based location was used instead of applications, which eliminated both the need to implement and the ability to avoid traveling.
In Israel, the trace based on networks was approved.
The network-based solutions that have access to brutal location data have significant privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary that all central server systems have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system was used that is not based on an application to carry out contact trace.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected trace information from various sources, including mobile device trace data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially counted people.
In addition to using this information to warn about possible contacts, the Government has also made that information on the location is available to the public, which is allowed because of the changes of great accessibility to the information laws after the MERS broadcast in that country.
This information is available for the public to various websites and applications. Some countries, including Germany, considered to use centralized systems and privacy protection.
On 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
The trace of contacts with privacy protection is a well established concept, with a large number of published investigations that at least at 2013 are remonted. On 7 April 2020, more than one decade of expert groups were working in respecting privacy solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth of low energy (BLE) to register the closeness of a user to other cell phones.
However, the PP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include the stream of closeness in order to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, before known as event numbers, CEN) and the protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact trace for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never get out of the device and all the installation occurs in the device.
The Media Lab Privacy Group has developed SafePaths, a platform for the use of technicals that protect privacy by collecting and using location data or route intersection to trace the COVID-19 propagation.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during a epidemie", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace of Enigma MPC, a company who develops privacy technology that was also founded originally in the Media Lab MIT.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technology that allows your users to have delicted location and health data with other users and officers without committing the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, several United groups in turn to what was essentially the same approach and with highly coherent protocols formed the World CNC Coalition with a view to reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of trace and warning applications, a key aspect to achieve a broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore Government announced that the BlueTrace Protocol code was opened by its official governmental application.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google, companies controling the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact trace that, in order to ensure, protect privacy, which is based on the combination of Bluetooth low energy technologies and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
Apple and Google are intended to implement the system in three steps:
implementation of the instruments for governments to create official coronavirus trace applications protecting privacy
integration of this functionality right in iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problems of continuous adoption and monitoring, firstly distributing the system to the operational system updates and then remove them from the same way when the threat has passed.
b' The reperfilation (also known as therapeutic reposition or change) is the readaptation of an approved medicinal product for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is online with the scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of convalent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple unit sites with the linking.
The analysis of these union sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral medicinal product against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important diana proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the protease is similar to papaine, the polymerase ARN addressed by ARN, helicase, S protein and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A. et al. studied several medical ingredients that then optimized and analysed to identify the similarity of its main chain with the most likely medicinal products to accelerate the development of a potential medicine against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinic study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloro=is an antipalutic medicinal product that is also used against some self-immunal diseases.
On March 18, the OMS announced that chloro and oxychloro would be related to the four medicines that would be studied in the clinical trial of Solidarity.
The Governor of New York Andrew Chomme announced that the tests of New York state with chloro and oxychloro would start on 24 March. On March 28, the FDA authorised the use of ≥oxicloro and chloro fosphate by an urgent use authorisation (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the process of clinical tests of the FDA and is authorised in accordance with an EUA only as a experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized, but who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of the ≥ oxyclore for profiling or treatment of the infection by SARS-CoV-2" is not yet established.
The doctors said they used the medicine when "no other option".
A Turkish research team in Stambul conductes a small study on the use of chloride in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At the University of Duke and the University of Oxford, large studies are being conducted.
The Langone Medicina Faculty of the NYU is conducting a test on the safety and efficiency of the prevention of the prevention of oxyclore.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that favipiravir was "proofly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negative in a average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with neumonia, the half received favipiravir, while the other half was administered with umifenovir.
The Italian Medicinal Agency recalled the public that the existing tests supporting the medicinal product are low and preliminary.

According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals for Trump's purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of disease if the virus has already been multiplied.
You may not be safe for pregnant women or who are trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The medicinal products were designed to inhibit HIV replication by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is changing medicines to find a composition that is one to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the Scientific community, there have occurred critics on the allocation of resources to the readaptation of medicinal products specifically developed for HIV/SIDA.
The OMS included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity Test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for disease by Ebola virus and infections by Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences later discovered that the remdesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filovirus, neumovirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistence through mutations that can result in a severe disease and transmission.
Some initial studies before the tests suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are current, including two guided by hospitals of the University of Cleveland; one for people with a moderate disease and another for those who have a seriouser disease.
There are three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials for hospitalized and seriously affected by COVID-19; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one without control (Italia).

The study, called COLCORONA, is recording 6000 adults of 40 years old and older with a COVID-19 diagnostic and heavy symptoms that do not repeat hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or who do not have an afective anticonceptive method are not eligible.
Various anticoagulants in Italy are being evaluated.
The heparin of low molecular weight is largely used to treat patients, thus the Italian Medicinal Agency published powders on its use.
On 14 April, a multicentric study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in prevention and therapeutic dose.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are devoting much attention to the readaptation of antiviral medicines that have been developed for previous breaks from SROM, SRAG and Nilo O.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with 7a of the Chinese pounds
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with 7a and 7a of the Chinese powders
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (lock IL-6) recipient: approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetic vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed the clinical tests, there are many attempts to develop that vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that he did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes disease in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in safety studies in phase I.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major broadcast was extended by the world in 2020, which designed significant investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genes published to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, production capacity, implementation and global access.
In April, the CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were investigating and developing at the beginning of 2020 to create a effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the dailys of the main platforms that have passed to safety studies in phase I, the following are:
Nuclear acid (DNA and ARN) (fase I developer and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virical vector (fase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
In April, the Scientists of the CEPI were informed, in total, 115 possible vaccines are at the initial stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (if it is planning or developing).
A stage I or II test conducts preliminary tests of safety and immunogenicity, of course, is random, is controlled by placebo and is performed in several places, rather than determining more precise and effective doses.
The trials in phase III include more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while controling the side effects resulting from the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (converted to the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (continued in the "preclinic research").
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular vaccine that would genetically change virus proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Approximately 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Va日ne Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work in a vaccine and expected human tests to begin in 2021.
On 26 January 2020 and at the Hong Kong University of 28 January, projects were announced for the development of vaccines in the Centre for Control and Prevention of Chinees.
About 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companys, leading by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is developing a oral vaccine with its biotechnological partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a Vaxart production association for vaccine development.
OncoGen in Romania published on 8 February 2020 a document with a design for a vaccine with similar technology used in treatment with neo-antigenic vaccines against cancer.
On 25 March, the Chairman of the Research Institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and that they were starting the tests.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-O日ology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptides vaccine against the COVID-19.
They were to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "in the 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Medical Research and Materiel Command in the Fuerte Detrick and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working in a vaccine.
By 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novax Inc.
in the development and production of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical test and a clinical test at phase I for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that he was working with 11 isolated and that, despite rapid progress, he would take at least one and a half year to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, informed the development of a similar part of the coronavirus with partial financing of the Canadian Research Institutes in Health.
The possible vaccine is at the investigation stage and is expected that human tests begin in July or August 2020.
The Guardian reported that the President of the United States Donald Trump had offered CureVac "increasing amounts of money for access to a vaccine against the COVID-19", before which the German Government was born.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical and Pfizer company announced a partnership with the German BioNTech company to develop together a vaccine based on ARNm.
The potential vaccine based on ARNm BNT162, is currently in pre-clinical tests and is expected that clinical tests begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, a Italian biotechnology undertaking, announced that the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that the tests in humans of the possible final vaccine could be started at the top.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for innovation in the Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced a investment of 4,9 million USD in a COVID-19 investigation association that includes the Institute Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Viena, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which leads to the total investment of the CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a vaccine against the COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists started tests in six possible vaccines.
Londry Imperial College Researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an ARN vaccine with authorization against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within the 14 days receiving the China sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced a financing of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to contrary COVID-19, which includes a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus broad is produced.
On 2 April 2020, researchers of the Medicine Faculty of the Pittsburgh University announced PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in ratons, and said that "the vaccines of S1 of the SARS-CoV-2 administrated by MNA received powerful responses from the specific antibodies (in ratons) of the antigens that were evidently two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Pharmaceutical Faculty of Waterloo University announced the design of a possible vaccine based on DNA as a Natal pulverizer.
Using therapeutics, DNA will be designed to replicate within human therm and produce inocus particulates similar to virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce anticorps against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three United States universities gathered resources for IBM supercomputers, together with computer resources in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise cloud, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease they had before.
Another random test in Âa seeks to enter 4170 healthy workers.
Vacunas that are developing may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to evaluate the efficiency of vaccines with specific animal models of the COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other non-human animals and primates, show the need to comply with biosecurity content measures at level 3 for the manipulation of live virus and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vacunas against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020 there is no cure or vaccine protecting against the SRAG that has demonstrated to be safe and effective in humans.
In accordance with research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies worldwide. There is also no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM was generali, it was believed that existing SRAG research could be a useful model to develop vaccines and treatments against infection by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, a vaccine against the SROM (based on DNA) completed the clinical tests in phase I in humans, other three were current, all of which are virical vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications in social media promoted a conspirative theory which caused COVID-19 virus was known and was already a vaccine.
Patents mentioned by various publications in social media are related to existing patents for genetic and vaccines for other coronavirus seats, such as coronavirus of SRAG.
b' The disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a effect-contagous disease caused by the coronavirus of serious respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, yours and difficulties to breathe.
Other symptoms are fat, muscle pain, diarree, garage pain, loss of olfate and abdomen pain.
The time between the exposure and the start of the symptoms seems to be about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most of the cases result in light symptoms, some progress to virical neumony and multiorganic insuficiency.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been recovered. The virus is mainly spread between people during the close contact, generally through the tossing, sternering or talking.
Although these glasses are produced when exhaling, they are actually falling into the stage or on the surfaces, rather than being counteractable in long distances.
People can also be counted by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive in surfaces until 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the beginning of the symptoms, although propagation is also possible before the symptoms and at the past of the disease appear. The standard method for diagnosis is the reaction of the polymerase with inverse transscription in real time (rRT-PCR) of a naofaringeo hisopath.
The use of maskers is recommended for those who doubt that they have the virus and their careers.
Recommendations on the use of maskers for the general public were different. Some authorities recommend that they do not use them, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment against COVID-19.
The local transmission of disease has been registered in most countries in the six regions of the WHO.
Those who are infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or have similar symptoms to those of the influenza, such as fibre, tooth, fat and difficulty to breathe.
The symptoms of emergency include difficulty to breathe, pain or persistent pressure in the wheat, confusion, difficulty to walk and face or to face. If these symptoms are presented, it is recommended to seek immediately medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the higher respiratory ways, such as strained, nausea gote and fat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, voimits and diarree, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China were initially presented oppression in the throat and wallets.
In some, disease progressed to neumony, multiorganic insuficiency and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 seems to be from five to six days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of those who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of the infection. If reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asintomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, the preliminar evidence suggests that they can contribute to the propagation of disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not present symptoms is now unknown and is studying. The Centres for the Control and Prevention of Corea diseases (KCDC) reported that 20% of the confirmed cases continued asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Committee of China eats to include asymptomatic cases in the daily cases on 1 April. From 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
As well as the saliva can have big virus loads.
Talk in high voice free more hot than when it is talked with a normal volume.
A study in Singapur discovered that the mouth could not be covered by the tosser can make the hair traveling 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus doesn't seem to be air transmission, the National Scientist Aymmia suggested that the transmission through biological soles is possible and explained that air collectors in the past outside the people's rooms were positive in virical RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) can cause the dissolving of respiratory secretions and, therefore, air transmission.
Although there are anxieties about the possibility of propagating by the hazards, it is considered that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation is possible before the start of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Prevention and Control Centre (ECDC) explains that a person generally infected two or three more, although it is not clearly the facility with which it is propagated, the virus survives hours or days in the surfaces.
Specificly, the virus was detected during one day in the carton, up to three days in the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable acid (AISI 304) and up to four hours in products with 99 % cover.
However, this varied by humidity and temperature.
The jabón and the detergent are also effective if they are used correctly. Jabon products degradate the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexide glucanate (a chirurgical defective), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken in a average of two days after the start of hospitalisation.
In five of six patients, the first show had the highest virus load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest virus load was observed in the second test day.
The coronavirus of the serious respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of serious aggressive respiratory syndrome, which was initially isolated by three people with neumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related natural coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the home jabón kills the virus, since it repeats its protective puzzle. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the SARS-CoV origin.
The pulmones are the most affected organs of the COVID-19, because the virus comes into anfitrion cells through the convertible enzyme of angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2) which grows more in the alveolary cells of type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "specule" (peplomer) to connect to ECA2 and enter the anfitrion cell.
In 12% of the hospitalized persons in Wuhan, China, an aggressive heart lease was identified, which is more frequently in serious disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammation response and the distortions of the immune system during the development of the disease, but the aggressive myocardial lease may be related to the ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 recipients have a high expression in the heart and participate in their function.
A high ability of trombosis (31 %) and venous tromboembolia (25 %) was detected in patients in the UCI with infections by the COVID-19 virus and may be related to a prognostic bad. In the autopsias of those who missed by COVID-19, a difused alveolar damage (DAD) and inflamator infiltrates with linfocites in pulmons were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epitelial cells expressing ECA2 of respiratory paths, patients with serious COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, it was observed that GM-CSF patogen lymphocytes were associated with the recycling of IL-6 secretors and a serious lung patology in patients with COVID-19.
In the autopsy, linfocytical infiltrates were also reported.
The OMS has published several test protocols to detect disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the stream of polymerase with inverse transscription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test seems to be made in samples of respiratory ways obtained by a nasofaringeo hysopath; however, also can be used tests of narrow or esput hisopate.
Generally, the results are available between a few hours or two days.
Blood analysis can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have a very small value immediately.
Chinese scientists succeeded to isolate the coronavirus sequence and published the genetic sequence so that the world's Õs could develop independently tests of reaction in the stream of polymerase (PCR) to detect the infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, anti-corps tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developing, but it was not largely used.
Experience in China with tests has shown that precision is only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States adopted the first test of diagnostic immediately on 21 March 2020 to use it for the end of that month. The diagnostic pounds published by the Hospital Zhongnan of the University of Wuhan would suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and the epidemiological risk.
The bilateral smerilated glass opacity with peripheric, asymetrical and later distribution is common at the initial stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, sub-pleural domination, disordered embedded pattern (sectal lobulil increase with variable alveolary full) and consolidation can appear.
A few data are available on microscopic lesions and the physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsy are the following:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral neumony can be observed:
Light nemonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of neumotitis, atypically big neumotitis, interstitial inflamation with infiltration of linfocites and forming gigant cells with multiple kernels
Several neumonia: difused alveolar damage (DAD) with difused alveolary exhibitions.
DAD is caused by an aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and serious hypoxemy.
Neumonia in curation: organisation of exhibitions in alveolary cavetes and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Sangree: diseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leucoeritrobastatic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibilities of infection include to stay in the house, to avoid places with many people, to lay hands with water and often taste for at least 20 seconds, to have a good respiratory hygiene and to avoid touching the eyes, narrow or mouth without weakening their hands.
CDCs are recommended to cover the mouth and the nose with a tossing or sternering pan and, if you don't have a bottle, use the internal part of the code.
A close hygiene from hands is recommended after tossing or sternering.
CDCs have recommended the use of screenshots in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asintomatic people. Social distance strategys seek to reduce contacts of people infected with large groups by closing schools and jobs, restricting travels and cancelling public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021, as soon as a key part to control the COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic pipe, which is known as "planning the curve".
The CDC also recommends to lay hands often with water and jabone for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are swimming, before eating and after sounding the nose, toser or sternurur.
They also recommend the use of a defectant for alcohol-based hands with a minimum of 60% of alcohol, but only when there is no water and jabone available at the time. For areas where defectants for hands are not easy to achieve, the OMS provides two formulaes for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobian activity results from etanol or isopropanol.
The peroxide of ́ogenus is used to help remove the thermal spheres in the alcohol; "is not a active substance for hands' antisepsia".
Glicerol is added as humid.
Patients are focused on support, which may include rehydration, oxygenotherapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDCs recommend that those who doubt that they have the virus use a simple mask.
Oxigenation by extracorporal membrane (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but the benefits are still being analysed.
In order to improve immunity, a personal hygiene and a lifestyle and healthy food has been recommended.
Support treatments may be useful for those who have light symptoms at the initial stage of the infection. The OMS and the National Health Committee of China have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people with COVID-19.
Intensity and neurologists in the United States compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020 there is no specific treatment for the COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend appearamol (acetaminofene) instead of ibuprofene.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of virus, especially in health care environments when procedures can be generated, such as intuition or manual ventilation.
CDC recommends health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 to place the patient in a air-infection area (AIIR), as well as to use standard precautions, precautions relating to contact and precautions to avoid air transmission. CDCs highlight the rules for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemy.
Recommended equipment are EPP bat, maskery, protectors and medical guards. When available, respirators are preferred (instead of maskers).
The N95 maskers are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authori holds its use by an urgent use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect the particulates in the air, such as the powder, but it is not guaranteed the effectiveness of a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
When no maskers are available, CDCs recommend the use of protective cards or, as the last resource, case maskers.
Most of the cases of COVID-19 are not sufficiently serious to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are it.
This type of respiratory support is actively studied for hospitalized persons with respiratory insufficiency related to COVIDA-19 and has already proved that intuition can be avoided with a high-level nasal canal or positive bipression in respiratory ways.
It is not yet known whether any of these two benefits the same to people in critical state.
Some doctors prefer use of invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the propagation of sole particulates compared to the high-level narrow cancer. Several cases are mainly given to adults (the older than 60 years old and, in particular, the older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough head beds in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle the repeated increase in serious cases of COVID-19 re-hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2,3% needed mechanical support for ventilation and 1,4% failed.
In China, approximately 30% of hospitalized people with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the UCI.
Mechanical ventilation returns more complete when a patient with COVID-19 presents an aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is always more difficult.
respirators are required with different modes of pressure control and PPTE to maximize oxygen supply, while the risk of pulmonary lease associated with the respirator and neumorrax is minimised.
The oldest respirators can not count with high PPTE.
The research on possible treatments eats in January 2020 and several antiviral medicines are in clinical trials.
Rendevir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take place until 2021, several medicines are already tested for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicines may be tested in persons with serious disease.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in tests of efficiency and safety of possible treatments. The FDA has given a temporary authorisation to the convalect plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is in serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subject to clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to lead to the disease broadcast.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application may detect the "heavy contact" and, therefore, a potential risk of infection through monitoring data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application recommends not only self-financing, but also warns local health officers. The analysis of the macrodata of cell information, facial recognition technology, monitoring mobile phones and artificial intellectuality is used to trace infected people and those with whom they were contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapur.
In March 2020, the Israelite Government allowed the security agencies to trace the data of the mobile phones of people who were suspicious of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who can enter contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also met the summary data of the location of phones with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the propagation of virus.
Russia implemented the facial recognition technology to detect non-compliance with the Quarentene.
The Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile phone operators have informed you that "in any way 40% of people continue to move".
The German Government carried out a 48-hour week-end hackaton with more than 42 000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldly request for creative solutions against the propagation of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxiety for quarantine, travel restrictions and secondary effects of treatment or fear of the infection in them.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, solety, anxiety for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect torment for mental health and people's welfare."
Sickness may follow a light evolution with a few or without symptoms, so other diseases of higher respiratory ways, such as common refrigeration.
Leaving cases are recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical can dure from three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnancy women may cause the risk of taking serious infection by the COVID-19 virus, in accordance with other similar virus data, such as SRAG and SROM virus, but the data of COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause neumonia.
In cases of more seriousness, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to the water respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) which causes respiratory insuficiency, sectical choice and multiorganic insuficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, adjustment of coagulation and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
The change in coagulation, particularly the increase in protombin time, has been indicated in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while the change in renal function is observed at 4% of this group.
About 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have high hectares (aminotransferase) enzymes.
The same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalisation.
However, for patients transferred to the UCI, a average of seven days between hospitalization and death passed.
In a study of incidence cases, the average time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was from 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate between the males was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopatologic tests of post-mortem lungs show difused alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exhibitions in both lungs.
Virical citoptic changes were observed in the neumocites.
The image of pulmones was similar to the aggressive respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In 11,8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, the heart damage resulted from high levels of tropone or heart paro.
The data of March of the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existent affair; the ability of medical resources and the socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality by affection were different from these regional differences, but also by methodological difficulties.
Insufficient calculation of light cases can make the mortality rate overstimated.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases contradicted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The smokers had 1,4 times more opportunities to suffer serious symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2,4 times more opportunities to need intensive care or fail in comparison with non-runners. Preocute long-term sequences of this disease.
The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong found a decrease of 20 to 30% of the pulmonary capacity in some people who were recovered from the disease, and the images of the lungs suggested the influence of the bodies.
This can also cause the syndrome intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections produced a long-term effective immunity in persons recovered from disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but cases recovered from COVID-19 have been informed that later gave positive in coronavirus.
These cases are a deterioration of a persistent infection and not a reeffect.
It is considered that this virus is natural and animal origin, through an interesting effect.
The real origin is not known, but, for December 2019, the propagation of the effect was almost completely due to the transmission of humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of the COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, indicated as the first date of the start of symptoms to 1 December 2019.
Official publications of the WHO reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures were different by region and at the time, as well as by a verse affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time passed from the initial break and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, the OMS assigned CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a COVID-19 clinical or epidemiological diagnosis without confirmation of infection by SARS-CoV-2. The letality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases divided in a given temporary interval.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global letality rate is 6,9 % (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
The number varied by region. Other measures include the letality rate in patients in CFR, which reflects the percentage of persons who die from a disease, and the letality rate in infected people, which reflect the percentage of infected persons (with or without diagnostic) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not of time and follow a specific population from the infection to the case resolution.
Although not all infected people produce anticorps, the presence of these can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the brot epicenter in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1,7%) has already failed.
In Gangelt, the disease was propagated during the carnaval festivals and affected the youngest, so there was a low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overcome.
In Netherlands, about 3% of the population has anti-corps, it was determined by blood donors.
It was confirmed that 69 (0.004 % of the population) died by the COVID-19.
The impact of pandemy and mortality rate is different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among the people in the studies carried out in China and Italy.
The greatest risk of the males is for those who are in their 50, and the breach between males and women is only buyed at 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was from 2.8 in women and 1.7 in women.
The accurate reasons for this sex difference are not known, but it could be deemed to genetic and conductive factors.
The immunological differences based on sex, the latest number of women who fum, and the fact that the males have corrupt infections, such as hypertension, could have contributed to the highest mortality rate in the males.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected people were vary, and 72 per cent of COVID-19 were worth.
In April 2020, the Government of the United States did not draw information on sexual infections by the COVID-19 virus.
Research shows that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influence and SRAG, are differently affected by males and women.
More than one percent of healthy workers, especially the staff, are women, and have more possibilities for virus exposure.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
The head of the OMS Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 at the date on which the brot was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was selected to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of persons, in accordance with international recommendations, is designed to prevent stagmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called coronavirus of serious respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer both to disease and virus.
Initial break in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, the OMS recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory water disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for virus and disease, in accordance with the indication of 2015 to not use sites in the name of virus and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
As a result of the limitations of capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hysops and parts of respirators.
For example, when a Italian hospital needed urgently the balloon of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it at the time required, a local emergency company performed an inverse engineering and printed the 100 needed balls during the night.
After the start of COVID-19, theories of conspiration, information and disinformation on origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that were rapidly spread by the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of virical replication in greenhouse, feet or powder.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international investigations on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization started the "SOLIDARIDAD Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four more promising antiviral compositions in relation to efficiency.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are developing actively possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 recipient to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a full virus vaccine.
The use of that virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at generating a quick immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, sub-unity vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that is able to acquire the immune system to certain virus sub-unities.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, that investigation is focused on the protein S that helps the virus to be placed in the ECA2 recipient.
A third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or ARN vaccines, a new technology for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficiency. On 16 March 2020, they eat the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inocus copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes disease. It was suggested that the improvement based on antibodies is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020 there are more than 300 active clinical tests.
Seven tests were evaluated treatments already approved for paludism, including four studies on ↑oxyclore or chloride.
Recepted antiviral medicinal products constitute the majority of the Chinese research, including nine trials in phase III on remdesivir in several countries, and reports should be submitted for April.
In April 2020, there was a dynamic review of clinical development on vaccine and possible medicines against COVID-19. Several antiviral medicines were evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including the following: remdesivir, chlore and ≥oxiclore, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
In March 2020 there are evidence of the efficiency of remdesivir.
The clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Clinical trials in phase III are carried out in the United States, China and Italy. The chlore, used previously to treat the paludism, was studied in China in February 2020. The results received were preliminary.
However, there are requests for parent reviews for investigation.
Core and China's sanctuary authorities recommend the use of chloride.
However, although the Wuhan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of a gram, it indicates that the double of this dose is very dangerous and may be letal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for use for − oxyclore and chloride to discretion of patients treated with COVID-19. The 7th and § of the Chinese pounds includes also the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high ribavirin dose is needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
More in vivo studies of nitazoxanide were recommended, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial cebatoe of protein S which performs the transmembranary serynase of type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the income of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with ECA2 recipient.
The studies of chloro and oxicloro with or without azitromycin have important limitations that prevent medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Liberation of citocins may be a complication of the last stages of the COVID-19 serious.
There is evidence that the oxicloro may have properties that prevent the release of citocins. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the treatment pounds after the completion of a small study.
It is found in an unfailed national test in phase II in Italy after observed positive results in persons with serious disease.
It is expected, in combination with a series of ferritin blood analysis to identify citocin freedoms, that is the cause of death of some infected people.
FDA adopted the interleucina-6-receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of cytocine-resistance syndrome resistant to steroids induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
Until the date there are no controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated anticorps produced by the immune system of which have been recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a passive immunisation method without vaccines.
This strategy is tested with the SRAG with unconcluding results.
Virical neutralisation is the expected action mechanism through which passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cyclotoxicity depending on anticorps or fagocitosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with anticorps are developed, for example, using monoklonal anticorps manufactured.
The production of convalent sugar, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific anticorps against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Patients by coronavirus, a group of symptoms is relatively related
