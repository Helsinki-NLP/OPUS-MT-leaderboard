Black box in your car?
While American road projectors are trying to find money on the remote network, many begin to see a solution in a small black box that will easily enter into your car's device table.
Equipments that follow each kilometre that engineer and transfer this information to the offices are the nuclear control effort to Washington and the State planning offices to renew an old system of financing of American main roads.
Of course, the low design of the halls once increased the intensity of the debate and the outcome of the most different sexes.
Libertarians met the ecological groups and lobby for the government to use these small boxes that would mention the miles and may be where you go, and then use these information to build a tax dimension.
The party's scared.
The American Union for Civil Freedom is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of problems with privacy protection.
And while the Congress can't agree whether to continue, some states don't expect anything.
They discover how they can be moved to the system in which the driver pays for kilometers of the street after which he goes.
Thousands of motorists have already been taken to test.
This is a real need for our nation.
"It's not about how much we can choose," Hasan Ikhrata, the Executive Director of the State Management Association in South California, who plans for this State to start tracking the miles of captive miles at each California motorist in 2025.
It's changing the way we pay these taxes.
It's to do that.
Furthermore, it is the fact that the Road Competition Fund financed by the Americans' taxes paying for the stations is at the bottom.
The Americans don't buy so much benzine as before.
Cars are going to take a lot of kilometers to one gallon.
The single federal tax, 18,4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the next 20 years.
As a result of the current higher gas prices, politicians are intended to bring tax to the only center.
"The gas damage is not simply sustainable," Lee Munnich said, a carrier of the university in Minnesota.
His state recently placed the tracking equipment to 500 cars to test this payment system in a milk.
"On view it seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it for a payment according to the number of miles.
There is no surprise that this idea likes urbanist liberals, since taxes can be used to change the patterns of conduct of drivers, which can help to limit transport lifts and creation of glass gases.
Californian projectors are looking forward to this system in planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitional legislation on global integration.
But the Republican Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), President of the Transport Committee, said that it also sees as the most urgent alternative period.
The representatives of the free market of the Reason Foundation organisation are also claimed that the drivers will pay for some miles.
"It is not a tax that disappears in the black wheel," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Reason Strategy Strategy.
People pay directly for what they do.
The initiative also supports two former American transport ministries who invited Kongres to issue the payment direction in 2011.
The American loni senate approved a pilot project for 90 million USD, which would include approximately 10 000 cars.
However, the leadership of remote representatives has refused and thus affected the fear of foreign legislators representing residents, whose lives often represent a lot of kilometres for work outside the city.
However, a number of countries and cities are going forward to their own growth.
The most horrible is Oregon, which included 5 000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the tax for a miles [1 km] rather than the tax for benzine.
The pilot project has already been completed.
New York's just checking the project.
Illinois is trying to do this in a limited way in the cost vehicles.
And coal I-95, which includes 17 state ministers of transport, together with the southern states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) study how to implement this change.
However, this concept does not have only a consequence.
In Nevada, where the equipment was recently equipped with approximately 50 auto volunteers, they were the drivers of anxiety because the government was able to follow each of their movements.
"Alauddin Khan was a big problem on the monitoring of the type Big Brother and similar matters," said Alauddin Khan, managing the strategy and operation of the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As a experimental project continued, the American Union of Civil Freedoms in Nevada warned on its websites: “It would be very easy to change these equipment to a full-valuable surveying machine.”
There is no need to build a weak hard infrastructure that will be unexpectedly extended on the evidence of each day outcomes and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are trying to be available to the State, which would enable the State to see how many kilometers of cars are found, but not exactly when and where.
You can do it, said Khan, the public will be more calm.
It brought some State agencies to a small company in California, named True Mileage.
This company has not been involved in the aid of the Government during the control of drivers.
She wanted to explore on the outcoming market with the assurance of legal responsibility, where the drivers would pay on the basis of how much they would be.
But this equipment that tests is attaching attention to the projectors of the road network because it does not use GPS and only adds about the quantities of information that are regularly recorded by modem.
"The people will be more willing to do so if you do not follow their ownness and their position," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Milleage.
In some of these pilot programmes, a number of big errors occurred.
There's a lot more leaving and less dangerous ways to do it.
The projectors in Oregona experience that the drivers give a choice.
They can choose GPS devices or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment, and they will be decided to pay the payment of the payment based on the average number of miles of all people of the country.
In other places, they hope that the public’s viewing will access this concept if the equipment will learn more, not less.
In the city of New York, transport officers are trying to develop departure equipment that would be equipped in order to also be possible to pay payments for parking hours to provide insurance in the miles of captivity and to collect data on the quality of other drivers, so the motorists can avoid the transport accommodation.
“Motorists will be willing to participate in that because of the value of the benefits offered to them”, states the city’s project document.
However, some transport projectors would like to share whether all payment debates in miles [km] are not only a major problem.
The Officers of the Metropolitical Transport Committee in San Francisco state that the Congress could have a problem with the bankrotated Carrier Fund very easy to solve the increased gas tax.
The single or annual tax may be thrown on the hybrid or other vehicles which do not have much fuel, so they will pay the right share.
"No radical operation is required when richly take aspirin enough," Randy Rentschler, manager of the legislative and public committee.
We'll do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their own privacy and many other things.
The Saturday is negotiated for the CSSD.
The social democracy is broken, humans and grandmothers speak together and seek a common procedure.
Social democracy will be charged for a few weeks, sitting at the acting table with finally depressed partners who will put a list of ready to the table, in addition to the ministerial posts.
The CSSD exposers, then, are the genderly coal oxygen, or raw to the garden minority government.
Saturday, after the four days when he was on the wall sympathy, he first hit him.
He was not able to control the political gram yesterday and mostly to bring a confessed lie to rejection.
The confirmed negotiator is then only it, the final members of the team shall be allowed after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee.
I apologize to the members of the Grammy and now to the citizens.
It doesn't lie, in personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hashek after the most useful leadership of the social democracy.
He added that the first president was missing.
"I'll make my decisions report to the GATT on 10 November," said Hashek.
Similarly, the Chairman of the Chairman of the CSSD Zdenik Schromach and the Chief of the Mailing Club of Jerome Tejc.
But he warned that he was chosen only two days ago.
Both members then announced that they would do everything for the fifty-year-old Club of the CSSD to be destroyed by one voice.
The Absurd Divade set Michal Hashek's corner with: "I am a member of the CSSD 15 years, I was loyal to her label and respected the decisions of the parties' authorities."
They made another lie in direct transfer.
Or did he forget that in the challenge of the Sabbath rejecting and its exemption from the negotiation team, the Saturday UVV was 57 per cent that Bohuslav is the candidate to the premises?
However, the Chief CSSD has made a strong enemy army by calling UVV to the next week.
His opposers have ten days to ship the e-mails 192 members of this body and the media of the most different weights and fams, eventually remember the real errors of the Sabbath political career.
It's going to work strongly a spiral, it's going to appear the signs of dark connections between Zenjak Bakalu and the Sabbath wheel.
The friendship of God’s glory of the Sabbath and the influence of the Advocate of the Council of Poverty.
They explode conflicts in the South African or More Coast Organization of the CSSD.
Warning is the words of the island recipient and the Sobots association of Petra Kajnara: "I signed Chart 77 because the country doesn't rule idiots."
If UVV had meet this week, the liars would probably have been brought to the ritual sacrifice of their lives.
The foreigners will get their head down and stay.
And at the moment, the winner boss CHSSD will end with the survival Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about the problems with OH in Soči: Communication with Russia is an emergency
His mouths indicate an intimate smile, and then the depth breathes, "It's anxious."
Cooperation with the organizational olympide team in Soči 2014 is a little more complex, according to the doctor Martin.
What was on the past olympy, we can forget.
"Nothing works the same," says the chief of the Czech Olympian mission.
What does it really happen?
A number of things works less, not exactly.
It's so artificial.
In view of the factur, they are relatively →, in view of adding information about the principles, no longer.
Maybe we have been looking for three months ago to add us how officially the individual villages will be marked, and they would like to do a number of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying that they're communicating this thing.
In many things, they still communicate.
Is the olympical village already delivered?
But it's not a catastrophic state.
We walked in empty rooms a month ago.
Happy homes are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Is it possible that the grounds are ready?
Just a basic beton, so that was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we come there as a preview on 26 January, he'll still feel a lepidle there.
And if they don't hurt, what?
Mr. Putin would think you'd be insulting the army there?
That's exactly what it's going to do.
Just so that the Olympian village is a bathroom.
They're worried that they're not reaching, for example, the road adjustment, they don't get details.
Maybe they'll have the ways in such a state that we'll have to break a bullet with us from the Londry Hers.
But I believe that they're giving it to the purchase.
How many Czech sporters could go to Sochi?
Now they are 78, although, depending on nominal criteria, this number is changed.
Perhaps the crashers will eat clearly in the three of the trials they're getting out.
Nobody needs to doubt about Martin Sablic, but otherwise it's in the development.
Is the way to Sochi still waiting for you?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until 26 January.
How houses will look in the Olympian village, we know.
We even put some things on ourselves, and we didn't just believe in the boxes.
We're also preparing a number of other things to be probably transported.
And what does the leader of the mission cent days before the olympics?
I'm preparing for the annual evaluation of individual olympical sports plus doing the same agenda in the sense of communication with the Organizational Committee in Sochi.
Putin promised the ecological olympiade, the plan would hate his secrets.
The winter sports fans are already holding meters to the start of the Olympian Hers in Soči, others are still looking for their preparation.
The Russian olympide, which will end up in February, is going to go with another scandal.
The Russians are not able to comply with the promise that the preparation and performing of her or in the least of the nature in Krasnodar country, in respect of Kavkaz, where thousands of sports and tens of visits will take place in four months.
Lastly after the olympy in Vancouver, the Russian lake had a very high place, the Canadian olympy games were written as the most dangerous for life.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putina to arrange games with "nual waste" has been taken for a long time.
Reporters of the AP agencies last week discovered the ship of building material in the village of Achshtyr near Soči.
Then the full of building material, pneu, canisters and isolation pounds have already found ecology in August, which immediately reported.
The Russian offices have disappeared.
Just for a minute.
Last week, reporters have seen a tree-bal-screen board.
It's not the only one, in such places, a few of them, described the British magazine The Times.
The Russian railways, the state monopol that builds a 60 miles [60 km] road between the airport in Soči and the sports resort.
A company who had already reached 280 billion rubbles has led one of the nearby Putin co-operations of Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways were prohibited that some of the sub-producers found the ship.
Local residents have already been disfellowshipped.
According to the people of Achshtyra, every three months a day and night, he drives a full waste material.
According to experts, a waste is threatened to contaminate the local Szymth river, other rivers, and finally the Black Sea.
"The water is from here to contaminate sodium waters in the next ten to fifty years," said the British magazine Vladimir Kimajev from EWNC's ecological inquiry organization.
The illegal staff are not the only problem of the Russian Organization Committee and Government.
The most dear olympide in the history, according to opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: Games in Soči will be $51 billion, while the year olympiade in Peking 2008 came to $43 billion.
Londing games in London were only 19 billion and mentioned a nine billion vancouver.
In addition to corruption scandals, project detentions and anxieties, if finally it will be enough of snow, the reports have also been shown that human rights are not subject to work on sport and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sent his mouth to protest that he hadn't been paid for two months.
Many are also afraid of how Russian organizations during heroes match the new law that prohibits promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors want Russian gays to support the olympy.
A young couple kidnapped to live with parents, a new house offers private for both generations
The Japanese study Tai and ́tes has been assigned to place a house on a park that lies on the corner of two streets, whereas the sole ground is somewhere.
The request continued that two generations would live in the house that would want to live together, but everyone should have a separate space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on the quietly-speaking ground.
The architects therefore decided to place every house to one of the fathers of the house.
"We respected family associations, stories and ambitions associated with a given place."
"Tree different houses are connected by some ways through the external object, so everyone knows the presence of others, but they have their own privacy," explains designers.
The household of the parents is at the level of the garden with an old bottle, to which family traditions and ambitions are respected.
The single parts of the house are easily discoverable, so different from the different final adjustment of the fashion.
While the main segment of the building is from the beton which the surface has been created using the panels from the cover, the part where the office is, the white is limited and the remaining elements have remained in pure beton operation without other adjustments.
Many walls of the house are completely proclaimed, thanks to what the house's interior is very connected to the foreigner.
The household of parents, the accurate kitchen, the eating and the apartment, has a small garden with a tree that has great importance for the family.
The internal connection with the external supports the side wall that starts on the garden and continues to the residence.
A kitchen room in the house of a young couple.
The young couple comes into the house by the main entrance in the hail, and then stakes up by steps to his room.
Just steps are the main dominant of the house's interior.
Their mouths enables them to look around the natural light through them.
They just tried to distinguish the house from others and press something unique to him.
The household of the young couple is united as one open room with a kitchen part, a food and a residence in the house.
From the teras, it's just a wall of the wall with the doors.
A residence area with food and kitchen parts in the house of a young couple.
The second pattern is composed as one large open room that is freely over to the tera, from where a beautiful view of the Tokyo bathroom is.
The single office in the highest stage is taken in pure white and black combination.
It's a dominant element of the house's interior.
The young couple comes into the house by the main entrance, splits into the income hall and then stands from there after the stage upward.
Protect academic freedom, it applies to the Earth and the ODS.
In recent months, I repeatedly invited students, pedagogies and leaders of high schools in some countries to protect academic freedom from the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman at schools.
I've met more or less success.
The Rector of Masarykov University in Brna, who refused the presentation of the Honourable President of the SPOZ - Termanovs in the preliminary period, has even been taken into the form of no call for the celebration of the State Festival of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who have not already been so stated and have allowed Milosche Zeman to visit: High Technical Learning in Brna, Gymnazium Hladnov in the Islava, High Company School in Eastern, Trade Academy in Colonia, University J.E. Purkina in Oast over Labe.
Now we are meeting in Pardubians with the continued promotion of the policy in high schools.
The newly selected ODS lawyer, thanks to the Faculty of Electrotechnologies and Informations of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to get away from its academic characters and also seems normal.
Mr. Professor, that's not the same thing as if you stayed in the oldest city.
Do you want to join the Chefs of the CSSD, who are currently a lawyer and a headman, as they degrade both calls?
Thus, you say to people that they're able to be able to control both of these appealing backs left.
I know, here's an example of Michal Haska, who even gets a few decades once.
But it's not just an example of a person you're supposed to conduct.
We will also find a reverse and positive example of MUDr. Stépanki Fraňk, who has already left a missionary post to be able to fully guide the city of Pardubice.
However, by giving my recommendation to leave thanks, it is that you will simultaneously distort the academic landscape of the University of Pardubice.
Pardubial ODS leads to your current effect on both posts as a advantage for the University.
"Your" school, however, you'll be able to help without being grateful.
I think a similar view like me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
Thus, consider your delays and keep your face.
Otherwise, you can be able to tell the choices in the next options.
And that doesn't have to have a long duration.
In Kunoviech bubla zilly, chemicals do not add
More than thousands of tonnes of oxygen green want to produce in the Slovak fruit of Kuno, which belongs to the food group of Hamé.
The season begins in October and takes a half-year hour.
a healthy deception here since 1925 has still been produced in a traditional way, so by shopping directly in big dances.
It's a rarite at the modern industrial time.
Our employees found a change for a decimal road.
Each of the ten tanks will enter fifty to thirty tons of green, filling one duration of three changes," said the manager of the Slovak Fruta David Kladrob.
The heads of green vehicles directly from their fields of agricultors from Austria and Brussels.
The employees of the fruit after the green cleaning, remove the cottons and go into the crap.
From there, the rained green falls into the bassins of six-meter deep depth, in which the white clothing and bullets are increasingly working.
That makes the unexpected air comfort.
The last assembled green layer is covered by the floor and heavy with water.
"The Green Crown then takes six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk weight without any additive of the substances supporting weights," said the manager Kladrob.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic substrates, individual levels of work with requests of salt and milk.
The green intelligence tries to the full line.
They're afraid in the sweet oxygen capsules in woods or glasses, and they'll be sterilated.
Hame adds oxygen green primarily to the foreign and Slovenian market.
It also registers the interests of it in some other countries, such as the Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to investigation from the United States
Edward Snowden, prosecutor of the American reporting services, noted that it is willing to go to Berlin to provide evidence to the German Parliament if the United Nations Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander ability to provide a response to questions about its activities.
The German lawyer Hans-Christian Strobele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where azyl was made to him, and acted with him about the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
The letter from Mr. Snowden, who sent the lawyer to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although the result of my efforts was evidently positive, the government has still acted in opposition as the runs and is trying to criminalize political evidence with difficult complaints that don't give the House of Deal.”
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that the support of the international communities could convince the Government of the United States to continue to be accused of criminal acts against him.
The accusations of the Ministerial of Justice of the United States included Spainship and State ownership.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Ministry of the Inside, said for the Time Online: "When Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officers, we will find a way to enable it."
The pressure in relation between the USA and Germany started to stand when it appeared that the NSA listened to Angely Merkel's office phone.
Thomas Opermann, a member of the parliamentary panel, watching the reporting panel, said that if any opportunity was to hear Mr Snowden as a witness, “without being a dangerous and totally destroyed relations with the United States”, this should be the effect.
Mr. Strobele, Parliament's lawyer for the German Green Paper, has published on his twitter contribution, which is with Mr Snowden.
Two German journalists brought her in their way to Russia.
Mr. Strobele said that, according to the former NSA contractual lawyer, Mr Snowden wouldn't be able to return to Russia if he had gone once.
If Mr Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he would need to make sure that it would be “in safe” there, he said to Parliament.
Mr. Snowden, in his letter, said that he had thrown up the hard and enduring campaigns associated with the persecution that brought him to leave home.
He said, however, that the reaction of the world to his "political act of exhibition" added courage to him.
The citizens in the entire and high officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the discovery of an inappropriate system of public survey.
The letter includes the proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."
killing us hates, but we're innocent, the representatives of the Red Khmers
Nuon Chea was a number of two in the Red Khmer's hierarchie and Khieu Samphan was a former head of the state.
For the Governments of the Red Khmers, who were oppressed in 1975 to 1979 on the maois and nationalism, lived in the result of excitement, hunger, disease, torture and correction of more than three million Cambodgeans, then at least fourth of the population.
The International Court of Justice for Cambodge has granted a lifetime penalty to this committee in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accusations of genocides and crimes against humankind in terms of torture, disturbance and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were deceived by believeing that they acted in the best interest of the people and did not know what is the range of murder.
"It's easy to say that I had everything to do, to understand, and then to put up and get up," he declared on Thursday Khieu Samphan before the court.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The truth is that I had no right," added.
Nuon Chea noted that he never commanded the Red Khmer cads to "humans wrong-handed or killed them to repair their food or kidnapping their genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely forgive publicity, sacrifice, their families, all the people of Cambodia," he said.
Fifty-year Bin Sivla, who comes from the Red Khmer regime on 11 families, AFP agency said that Nuon Chea can't accept excuses."
"He lies to us."
"Only wants to be forgiven by the guilty."
"It doesn't matter about the other," she said.
"If he doesn't give orders, his undertakings wouldn't kill," she added that the leaders of the Red Khmer are "worst than the monster."
Before the court, he also had to become a "ministre of the Rude Khmers Ieng Sary" regime, who died in March.
His wife Ieng Thirith, the Society Ministry, in September 2012 the court looked for an unable process for demention.
The leader of the Red Khmers Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines wants to pay manual liabilities
Frontier Airlines plans in its years to make an amount of up to 100 USD for the storage of a hand-container on the ground.
Frontier Airlines plans to carry up up to 100 USD for the manual library and 2 USD for coffee or sodium, although in their notice in the middle, they said that travelers would be able to keep the whole cow.
The new payment for the handhouse is related to the liabilities in the upper place, so small lifts under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier community says that he will pay 25 USD if the payment is paid before, and 100 USD if the travelers will wait until the arrival of the port.
The Frontier Kate O'Malley's speaking company indicated that the staff payment has to encourage the traveling to take ahead for payment.
"Don't do this payment," she said.
The aircraft companies began to apply the first and second committee in 2008.
The travelers tried to avoid these payments and locked into the hand-cover liabilities hidden in the local room as far as they could, so there was often a mistake in this room.
The payments are one of the ways as a traveler learning to take less things on the bottle.
O'Malley said that with the meaning of this new payment, there's no more money to get.
It is that Frontier's most reliable clients claimed that the place in the upper place is still more difficult.
Travelers who buy airports on the websites of the company are paying.
This means that one traveler at the front front at the front of the Frontier company can bring a commitment for which he does not pay anything, while the second traveling in the front will pay 100 USD for the same commitment.
O'Malley said that web pages and procedures will be adjusted so that the traveler will learn about the payment before his arrival to the port.
The new payment of the Frontier for the handhouse has already been in force before the year, but the date has not yet been laid down.
Traveling to payments for liabilities and other taxes are often difficult, but aircraft companies love them.
It states that the manipulation is worth money, and the travelers who request this service should pay for it.
Many in Wall Street take another charge for the commitment as a sign that the aircraft companies are trying to choose enough money to cover the aircraft costs after years.
But most of them didn't be charged for hands.
The Spirit Airlines company first applied manual obligations three years ago and the other low-based company Allegiant Air followed her example later.
The only company who has such taxes is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says the adviser in Jay Sorensen airport, who carefully follows additional payments.
In his report from 2011, he considered that the payment for the hand-in-law of the Spirit company would bring 50 million USD annually.
Sorensen, an ancient leader of Midwest Airlines, was recently flying by Spirit and spending over what he saw at the door when the travelers met the unusual complaint of the Spirit for the handing commitment.
"It was the most important thing I ever saw in my air carriage," he said.
I was waiting for me to see the teeth and the hair spreading at the door.
The airplane was full, he said, "and the income passed in the middle."
Frontier also applies for coffee, tea, sodowk and juice.
Frontier said that travelers who get limonade or juice can leave the whole cow and coffee will be completed freely.
The water will continue to be given free.
In 2008, the US Airways tried shortly to carry out a drink payment, but after the trip of traveling from the seven months, no other significant aircraft company followed it.
Frontier's last travel to pay the manual liability, if the traveler does not buy any years directly from this aircraft company, it is its last attempt to move the clients directly on its website.
The aircraft companies pay the Internet road to sellers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each sale airport.
This has made all aircraft firms to lead travelers to purchase directly from them, rather than to do it by the Internet travel agencies.
However, the Frontier community has continued in this area.
In September, she began to give the clients who bought the Internet travel to the Agency, only half a miles in the program of integrity.
In the middle of the mile of the mile, the recompense was 25 per cent of the road.
So the road with Frontier's company is 1000 miles buyed through the Internet path to the agency means a recompense of 250 miles.
The clients also allow the company to choose their seat forward only if they purchase directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier's company has a basic foundation of clients in Denver's home town, but her business is starting to hurt and lose money.
According to the financial results listed in the middle of the Republic Airways Holdings markets, the markets were decreased by 9 per cent and the transport capacity was reduced by 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The Company of the Republic with the sale of this aircraft is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
For the fall of NSA web pages doesn't accuse hackers, but "Internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency reported last Friday that its websites were fallen for a few hours a week ago because of a internal error, never because of the attack of hackers, as some said on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov sites were not available for a few hours tonight because of a internal error that occurred during the regular update,” the Spanish Agency reported in the e-mail declaration.
The problem will be removed during this evening.
The fact that the accident was caused by the DDOS attack (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Before this evening, online servers recorders mentioned that NSA websites did not work at least six hours, and pages are still not available for some.
ABC News reported before the NSA speaker that the internal sensitive networks of the agencies were not "total" threatened.
The speaker said no injured information is threatened.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed that it was responsible for the NSA site for the DDOS attack.
DDOS plugins are proposed to float target websites with information until the servers fail and the page falls.
This cybernatic tactic is relatively simple and the meaning of attacks is not to get into the internal target system.
The former supersecrete Agency of the NSA, which at the time has received a survival No such agency, has been made in the past months after the discovery of the public and home investigation programmes with the middle of public attention and the coincidence of the product of the secrets of the NSA files from the Agency and their exposure to the former employeee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy involving the Agency has highlighted an earlier speculation that today’s accident was a result of a targeted cycle operation.
The winning of Bombardier has fallen through the reduction of supply and negotiation
On Thursday, the Canadian Airport producer and Bombardier Bombardier reported a 15% reduction of pure profit, which is caused by less than the number of negotiations and the supply of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the influenza unit.
The Bombardier company with the Side in Montreal also published no data on air test for its new type CSeries aircraft, nor offered the current information about whether this airport will contain a ambitional plan to start commercial operation from the next September.
After the starting trial year, about a month ago and a half of the airplane was only three times flying and raised a question of whether the test phase works well.
The results have not been filled with deficiencies and actions in Toronto were reduced by 8 per cent.
Analytics of the State bank Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating from the "heighter importance" to the "sector' economy" in the next quarter or two periods of growth.
"When we had smaller airports, we expected most of us, we were extremely deceived by the profits in transport," Doerksen said in the report to the clients.
With the way the experimental program will continue, we believe that Bombardier will get a new CSeries aircraft negotiations.
However, in the next months, no new negotiations have been reported, we assume that the growth of the market creatures on this programme have grown.
The Bombardier company hopes that CSeries aircrafts are running into the bottom market that now dominate Boeing and Airbus.
The experimental aircraft was discovered in March and after a few months later, the first channel was found in September.
However, the start of the committee of the CSeries aircraft is reaching a short 177, since potential buyers wait for the results of the experimental airplane to be able to verify the company's claims relating to low contrasts and the impact of the costs of this transport aircraft.
Currently, 403 negotiations and commitments from 15 clients and operators are in total.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected that when introducing the first aircraft to commercial use, Bombardier will reach its target 300 liable negotiations.
The leaders also assured the analysis and media on Thursday that the programme is planned.
"The experimental airport has not remained on the ground longer than expected," he said in the Conference Chair of Beaudoin and noted that tests on the ground and software updates were planned during the distance of the airport.
Every manufacturer plans it differently.
We decided to resolve the first year and then focus on the update, and we did it.
This will happen during the whole planning program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five trials of aircraft should fly in the overlaying weeks and the final short after.
However, the analysers are skeptic about that the first client could start operating the CSeries aircraft for 12 months after his first year.
The Bombardier company claims that she has evaluated its plan of transmission of aircraft and the updated information in the following months.
“This late time of air tests – although it is in accordance with the Bombardier's internal plan – clearly strengthenes our opinion that the introduction to the operation will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
From 172 million USD or 9 cents per one action in the previous year, in the third quarter of the end of September 30, the clean winning of Bombardier was 147 million USD, or 8 cents per one action.
The eligible expenditure for one action remained unchanged to 9 cents.
Rotation marginally reduced from 4.2 billion USD to 4.1 billion USD.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Re日s expected an analysis of 10 cents to one action and to operate 4,56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicated that 57 aircrafts per year ago were added only 45 aircrafts during that quarter.
The pure negotiations fell from 83 airports to 26.
Incomplete air division prohibitions made up to 30 September 32.9 billion, which does not change to 31 billion.
"The results of the airport were in accordance with our views, but the low income of the negotiations and the total market status has distorted us," said Beaudoin.
The vineyard in the aircraft was decreased by 13 per cent per 2 billion USD.
Bomberdier, the biggest producer of wolves in the world, indicated that the outcome in this division increased by 11 per cent by 2.1 billion USD.
Incomplete transport prohibitions were made up to 30 September, 32.6 billion, which would be higher than 31 billion marginal growth.
Research in the transport division has been affected by problems with the implementation of a number of large contracts.
The leaders have noticed that in the fourth quarter, new views will be provided.
Action to Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of the financial manager of Google Patrick Pichette, has reduced the trading on Thursday by 8.5 per cent at the value of 4.83 USD.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial airports and the closest competitor of Bombardier, announced on Thursday the ten-percent fall in the fourth profit.
Cocaine, which warned mafian before police investigation, is in service
Basharat Ditta (42) had to provide information to the king's sublime to Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug dependence would be revealed.
The Liverpool Corn Court sent him to three years of procedure.
The spider who informed the drug mafian about a large police investigation, because fearing his drug dependency to appear, was sentenced to three years of procedure.
Basharat Ditta (42) had been subject to cocaine consumption, and the Neil Scarbrough's leader's highlighting was to provide sensitive information on the investigation of its activity on drug feeding.
The lawyer, whose supervisor was “Bash” (parts) and who was celebrated as the best legal representative, was arrested in 2011 after Scarborough's police investigation, which was in the previous procedures on drugs.
The police watched Sarborough (32), as he left in a lawyer house in Blackburn in La Unit, which was just at dinner with their colleagues from the Practice Society, three cents of cocaine.
On the basis of the tests on which the cocaine tracks were found in his hair, on his money and credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug holder of class A.
During the eight months, from January to August 2011, he was trying to gain carefully information about the arrest of two men in the benefits of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were at the same time investigated in a large survey of heroin and cocaine in the La Units, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After heavy and cocaine remained in the range of policies, about 1,5 million GBP together with 200 000 GBP in preparation, there were 32 other people.
Ditta (42) provided information to criminals of fear that it would come to its dependence on cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works in the legal company of Forbes Slicitors with a seat in Blackburn, has been invoked a moment before the Liverpool Corn Court of Justice after three weeks of computing, when he has been investigated for the guilty of that in two cases that he has prohibited the execution of justice.
During the previous hearing, he was admitted to cocaine disorder.
Some of the falls occurred after the police investigation of Scarboroughs proved that he was in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detective suspicious followed, mentioned his arrival to Ditt's house and saw how he placed drugs with cleanness 60 per cent of the lawyers under the black golf hand.
The next was Scarborough with Ditta, who was at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers station in Ewood Park, in regular phone chat.
The craft returned home where drugs were found, and there were nine talks between both people.
In the case of the court, the drug tracks of class A were found in his hair, money and credit cards and that Ditta was a “regular” cocaine.
Ditta was fully arrested, but the use of cocaine was depressed, and he said that he spoke with a suspicious dealer because he was his customer, and argumented that their conversation falls in “true communication”.
During his arrest, Ditta took his money and tried to put out a few credit cards from her, but all were arrested and cut off his hair patterns.
At the police hearing, he said that he was operating the office and at his home address, so on the workplace, and that the customers visited him for the work business and home.
However, the Court heard that after key prisons, he contacted significant players in the drug supplier box, some of which had previously represented to inform them of what they were detective.
The prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "Who else is more than that he should not violate the right than the legal representatives in criminal law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of dismissing the position of the legal representative and that he has reached too close contact with a particular customer.
It's not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer, which resources his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations were probably legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far away from the border of the running relationship of a lawyer-client.
The police investigation was married as much as he could to allow them to continue in their crimes.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring good news to his profess, but he's dismissed it.
He was too close to some of his clients, especially with Scarborough, and allowed him to be dismissed of his independence.
Ditta refused and said: "If I would be a corrupt lawyer I'm not, and I would like to give Mr Scarborough information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
However, after hearing, the police inspector Lee Halstead from La Havashire said: “Man Dytta has become a criminal at the moment when he has started to get drugs from organized criminals.”
His dependency on cocaine has affected him without prejudice to the purposes of the former representatives of the organized crime groups, which gave him the task to facilitate valuable information on police investigation.
The representatives must maintain the highest principles of disappointment and have the public confidence and feeling that they can be limited to them.
Mr. Ditta has given this confidence and tried to hide behind his profession.
The agency for serious and organized criminal acts in La Havashire has led against Mr. Ditt's investigation, which has also been judged in three cases of cocaine and now for the prohibition of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring crimes before the court.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is outside the hands of the law.
We'll find you and put you before our courts.
Sam Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years after it was declared a guilty of association after adding heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
The remaining thirty-five persons involved in trade were totally imprisoned for 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a online conversation, in which he said that his excited work would be right to represent customers from the block of the entire death in America, as a host for dinner, Mohammed Aliho would like and as a motivation for work.
He negotiated about the government with Klaus and Spidlo.
Now the people of Jana Kasala have sent against Babys.
People have received fourteen missions in the elections, so only the third number of social democrats or representatives of the United Nations.
The Government's negotiation, but they are at least one of the benefits.
In the team that has already started to consider the possibility of coal, Jana Kasala - a man who has shiped for humans undermines of the Government in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social democrats or Andrej Babiš have no such math on their side.
It is likely that this time the first negotiation in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experiences were at that time minimal," Casal recalls how aeroplane talks will be developed.
Kenya printed by the Media Controversial Law
"It is a terrible report and it is at the place to ask what the Parliament's restraint is to make it easy to make the independence of justice tomorrow," reported the newspaper that considers the law as anti-dumping.
"This law is cruel and very repressive and we reject it," Cyrus Kamau, the General Director of the Capital Group, which belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most recognised independent stations and reporting sites.
He said that the new Media Court “we will be precluded because it is extended by the government’s hand and that restrictions relating to the scope and advertising will damage Keni's position in the world economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to refuse this law and return it to the matters," he said.
According to the journal Star, the law of the real government is “complete control over media” and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of manifestation in Kenya“shared with firmness” and criticizes the law as“right”.
The approval of the law comes to a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security without a serious attack of the Islamic Shoot in the Westgate Building Centre.
The wrath of the offices on herself turned the chenical media by sending the record of the security camera on which the soldiers were evidently trading the trade with the luxurious goods.
The police manager reacted so that he allowed two journalists and the leader of the media work to hear, but the call was downloaded after the pressure of the media.
According to the new law, media companies may be cut up to 20 million kinesic shillings and individual journalists to one million together with the risk of “committing from the list” or may be removed by the official newspaper acreditation.
The Court also has the right to enjoy the property of the packaging if there is no packaging paid.
According to Daily Nation, “there is a lot of temptation to eliminate the rate of voting stations”.
It also states that these measures may have a liquidation impact on what the Chinese blogosphere is called “life”.
The politicians believe that when they shut up the media, they can do what they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote the journalist of Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described the Chinese media as a key source of the system of mutual control and exercise in public life.
"When we leave it in politics, they will bring the country to bankroot and bring us back to jail and collection," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenia were in the past the criticism of the public.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of the ships designed by the National Mountain Agency and for the renewal of their free payments about 532 000 unexpected shillings a monthly monthly, which are so covered by the highest world.
You have to join, you young Czech.
Most of them, but not even with any rates
More of the Czechs gives money on the side.
However, they do not reach champions in the region.
The most money are stored by the Rakusanas, which will cover a monthly average of EUR 181.
Something more than the Czech, and people in Slovenia.
It comes from the Erste Savings Barometer group in the Middle and East Europe countries.
It also shows that the guards are improved, and two thirds of the questioned plan to give more money to the side.
While the Czech Republic is the rubber of the guards, in Romania and Serbia, the combined products still use very little.
For example, for example, every other Serb will, according to the investigation, cover the house "below the pool".
In foreign years, the amounts of those who will cover more amounts monthly.
Any monthly, for the most different types of dilution, thousands to 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 percent of respondents, it is about five percent more years.
The average monthly record in the interannual comparison, but lowly decreased to the 2078 crown.
The biggest hit between the combination products is pension accommodation.
This represents 54 per cent of the Czech, while three years ago it was the most favorite way to evaluate the impact of only 36 per cent of people.
Instead, the construction facility is lost, and the layout of the past year has also been extremely interested in investment funds.
You're already using only 16 percent of respondents, while loni was almost a quarter of people.
The investigation also shows that although people consider to be important to share, most of them do not know what results are achieved on individual products.
For more than 30 years, young people don't know how their money is estimated.
In contrast, the best reports on the importance of their invested money have the oldest group of questions, among people over fifty years, knows percent of the questioned.
In the international comparison of the Erste Czech group, they lead to the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44 percent of people.
These are followed by Slovakians and Rakused with 12 percent degree.
The United Nations celebrates new goals of fighting poverty
The United Nations starts without prejudice to a new target file replaced by the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which have been introduced 12 years ago after the global poverty.
Before the summary of the United Nations on the sustainable development, which began in Riu de Janeir, the Australian diplomates played a key role in the implementation of “stainable development goals” that would be able to replace MDGs, whose validity will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by the world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The general secretary of the ONN Mr Ki-mun on the summit said that it is now time to “communicate over national interests”.
"I am glad that the Member States have agreed to launch and overtake the process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDG will develop a progress achieved in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an increasing part of the development programme after 2015.
I will make every effort to fill the mandate given to me by the Member States and implement our views on the objectives of sustainable development, which will set up for the success of the MDG.
The safety concerns of Mosambique are involved in the conflict of strong personalities
Under the Sochou Samory Machely, the Mosambic founder president, there were thousands of people in the centre of Maputa to provide peaceful passwords for a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the Executive Director of the Investment Society.
With the fear of its country's future, the business clothing changed by the "We request security" entitlement in Portuguese and joined it on Thursday to the taxation of independence in the main city.
After two weeks, there were reports daily about conflicts between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst ways from the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was sometimes an unrealisticly known rebellious movement, supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the Government of the apartheid in South Africa in the efforts to destabilise independent governments of this country.
After peace agreement in 1992, the opposite party became an opposition.
Analytics are convinced that it is unlikely that it will re-expire an open conflict in the country, but recent events have rebuild investment and local events.
It is a growing economy, since the discovery of the broadcasts of the surface reserves and the north-west carriers can bring from the company in the next few years such as the Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, the Italian Eni and the American Anadarko, investment in more than 50 billion dollars.
The Governing Party of Frelimo, dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo is accused of exciting efforts.
The Renamo Party states that the government has called the last conflict by 17 September the attack on their members in the region of Sofala, the traditional Garden of Renamo.
The violent attack of ancient rebels was successfully removed when government forces attacked on the basis of Renamo and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times speaker of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government charges for the running of the Renamo conflicts because it was supposed to attack soldiers.
President Armando Guebuz tried to disturb instability.
Mr Guebuza for the French press office of AFP in the middle said that Mr Dhlakama had seen himself as a "stroskotance", who wanted to use "what was left from his power to try to prove that the government could order his own decisions."
Like Frelimo, Renamo says they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased when Mr. Mazangy's words were quoted that Renamo is declined from the peace agreement of 1992.
The FT's letter said that he thought that the Frelimo party did not comply with the agreement anymore.
"Our goal is to return to negotiation, but with seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between these parties were made to reduce the tensions between these parties, split a number of roads in this year, just a little.
It's a bridge between two big persons (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lector at the Open University and the Professor of Mozambik Joseph Hanlon.
Neither one of them is a good negotiator, nor one of them is ready to perform the necessary procedures.
The Renamo party, who was looking for election changes, already said that she would boycot the communal elections planned for November.
The President and Parliament's elections are planned for the next year.
Some commentaries interpreted the use of strength as an endeavor to get from the government of benefits and financial challenges.
The electoral part of the Renamo is decreased since 1992, while the newer part, the Democratic Mosambique Movement (DHM), which was established by the former member of the Renamo, according to the expectation of its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza, whose next year ends the second period of age, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"The democratic system doesn't want more sides, doesn't want transparent choices, doesn't want peace, because it does not want the President's office to leave," said Mazanga.
It is unexplained what Renamo's possibility is, but he has performed divergence terrorist attacks on the police station and on the key route between north and south.
In the province of Sofala, which is some hundred miles away from Maputo's main city, but where the city of Beira is, the town on which the rental company, including the Rio Tinto and Vale, is at its export of carbon.
In June, Rio stopped the use of the railway for a week when the Renamo party threatened that it would attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to express himself to ask if Renama reacts to his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the Mosambique is not good," said Mazanga.
Instability increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company of Mediacoop, and many are also concerned about corruption, late development and recent income.
"The people think that the responsibility for the future of the country is worth the government and the President and that he must be the one who will find a solution to problems," he says.
Demonstrate Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo, nor Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want to have free access on the street," he says.
Children should be involved in myths and legends as “models for the way of life, ” says the author.
The warnings about Thor can show that “the green force cannot be equal to the wise luxury, ” while artus legends discover how important it is to be dreamed.
A large part of myths would "for school education be too scandal, and in some cases too scandal," Crossley-Holland said, "which works for a careful choice.
"I think it's great that myths and human creatures are already part of education," he said.
I had this plan after twenty years.
He added that the "openly teachers" authors and factors are in a dismissed story with a "suppression" message for children as "switcher".
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Epos Beowulf from England and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Bachorki, says: "You can have good intentions, but you're going to do better if you leave them for yourself."
The greatest difference between adult writers for adults and adults writers for children is likely to feel a feeling of an adult.
Not whether everything must be simplified or finished by the happyend, but there must be a natural sense for good and evil.
And it must be a subconscious; discovered by the story, never openly defined.
The old truth about it is better to show than to describe.
The Brinish Star will take visits to the universe in a new digit
The first view is apparently that the large planetary salt has changed in the last half of the year.
There is a new holiday here, visitors can be thrown into new comfortable seats, and over their heads the project area has reached a middle of 17 meters in the treasure of the American company Spitz.
At the salon, his most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To be a perfect image, there are other smaller projects in the salon.
Another important part of the whole equipment is hidden behind the walls of the room.
"It's about twenty and one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Branch Star Jiří Duschek.
The computer will ensure that the image of some projectors is not covered, but gives a complete idea.
"The computer is thirty-four-four times higher than the classic personal computers," said the technology from the star Tomas Hladik.
Digitary can test extraordinarily realistic and plastic model of night clouds, human body or the ocean.
Wonders will be so deceived directly to the universe or the human brain.
Another similar equipment is nearest in Varsovia or Hamburg.
The leading of the stars plans in the salon to prevent purchased orders and its own creation.
From Saturday, they're two orders.
The name is Astronaut and is designed for adults.
People in it will learn about the cosmonaut trend, go to the universe, run to the centre, and then on the examples they will see how astronauts are in the cosmos.
The second order is for kids and his name is Coussel Potes - Kaluoka'hina.
It explains the story of the deceasure that petrobar’s people lived with a quiet life until the time when a nearby shot exploded.
The whole digitary remained about fifty million crowns, which payed highly the Ministry of School.
The smaller amounts also contributed to the city of Brno and the stars from their budget.
The projectboard was 10 million crowns, a projector of 12 million.
"The rest of the audiovisual technology and computers," explained Duschek.
The digitary installation followed the restructuring of the whole building that the star had passed two years ago.
According to Duška, 25 to 30 thousand visits could be reached until the end of the year.
We wake up 110,000 INZERATES!
We know where they want you to work!
In November of the latest year, the analysis captured over 11 thousand inserates offering work instead, from which 4300 were published in daily printing and 6800 inserates (62 per cent) on the Internet.
Thus, the Internet becomes the most important media for the publication of the job offer.
Moreover, in 2005, when the investigation was first conducted, he made its share of 26 per cent.
In the last two studies (2007, 2010) it was estimated to 60 per cent.
The insection of work options in itself, according to a significant measure, reflects the current performance of the work market.
For example, it can be simple to compare the number of published injections during the economic prosperity and during the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25 900 inserates were published in the same period, and in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented to the outer, in particular a more-professional group.
In contrast, the offer of work in daily print covers a wide range of professionals of these workers, introduced the author of the analysis of Paul Schististn.
The measure of deployment of the selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the first places of insects looking for managers and managers, business representatives, developers and financial experts were restarted.
The position of developers or leaders of small enterprises was only figured on the Internet.
In the daily pressure, the part of these professionals is very lower, however, large jobs belong, in particular to professional and professional professionals.
Among the most often stated requests that employees express insurance offers, obviously belong to education.
The next followed was the knowledge of foreign languages, especially the English.
In the daily print, a request for the knowledge of a foreign language was mentioned in three percent of inserates, on the Internet in 37 per cent.
Only two percent of employees requested an active knowledge of two other languages.
The "computer Gravitation" claims appeared in 40 percent of inserates (in daily printing at 11 per cent, on the Internet at 57 per cent).
The training practice was requested in 54 per cent of inserates.
The applications for practice are in the universe associated with professionals.
It is, in particular, about the leader production and another leadership.
Working professions are particularly about mechanisms and manufacturers or manufacturers and food products manufacturers or electrical equipment manufacturers, the author has supplemented the study of Jiří Tillner.
The employees also in the half of their insects take the requests for the properties and skills of the eventual candidates.
As the most often requested powers, in the first place, the communications powers have already been detected in the insight.
In addition, employees require flexibility, adaptability and dynamic, self-responsibility, responsibility, organizational capacity and coherence.
Ben Greenman: Ten years of non-euro festival comedy: New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is a place where the solar comic exhibition was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, a different artist of Frank Fray, who worked as the president of the offices in the Palace Theatre district in Broadway, began to tell the confusioned people with a talking method.
Fay's innovation has been expanded during the years, the newest initiative of the non-euro festival of the comedival.
Festival based and managed Caroline Hirshova, the founder institution of the Soviet Common Carolines, celebrates its tenth year – together with more than sixty representations in small clubs and big divisions.
"The majority of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful in the measure that they were too big than to play in the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as the opportunity to continue working with them.
The annual event includes the exhibition of Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffins and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes” (for herds), every year-based musical beneficial representation in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival was expanded, the world was expanded by the comic.
A number of comics of aeroplane festival came from non-radical channels, such as shows in smaller voice or television companies, such as Comdy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll exposed himself to his sister (the western "League" to the fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedial show at Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of the program "Saturday night live", so "Parks and recreation", but mostly she glorified the broad series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on" (must Marcel in boats).
Like Kroll, so Slate, as well as other young committees with divorceous voices (surreally pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, anxious, racially spectacular W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralised world of the American comic.
One of the biggest festivals will be a discussion: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a single comic, but he became a successful TV and movie recorder, the same as an inofficial history of the comic.
Since 2005 to 2007, he was on TV Land show called “Site down comedy with David Steinberg”.
The meeting is held in Town Hall in the centre of Manhattan.
"This city is absolutely in the comedial DNA of Larry's whole work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he was here, he's going through the street between two buildings and he says, "Man, if I come for all the money, I can live here.
The price of the rope continued to fall on $96 per bar.
The price of the breast price continued to decrease the fact that the prejudice to high resources was exported by a report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese famine sector on energy.
The American raw indicator for supplies during the latest period has fallen in the European electronic trade at the non-euro trade box of 14 cents to 96.24 dollars per barley.
On Thursday, 39 cents were decreased and 5,8 per cent remained for October.
Rich resources in the past weeks were charged by the price.
The Middle Energy Ministry declared that the American resources have increased by 4.1 million bars last week.
In five weeks, the resources increased by more than 25 million bars.
On Friday, however, two reports about the Chinese product came to bring up a number of applications that demonstrated growth in activity.
This indicates that China's economic refund could continue to increase the growth that was raised in the previous two weak decades in the third quarter of 7,8 per cent.
Ropa Brent, the indicator for international rope, also used by the American raffinery, fell on the International Trade Board in London at 26 cents per 108,58 dollars per bar.
No, Mr. Hashka.
We have the only opportunity to tell the politics that it is not.
It is necessary to develop such a pressure that Martin Hashek should be released from all the political agencies and leave the missionary mandate.
Any other solution reduces the level of political culture, which is already so mixed.
Martin Hashek is secured by the promise that he gave, but everyone and politics must be the results of the promised promise and consider very much what it can promise.
The confidence is the only area that politics (Mr. Babiš has also the material, but is the question of whether they are politics).
The first lying program is incredible.
It's not involved in politics, it's dismissed in politics.
Mr Hashku, if you think this is good with this country (and your frequent statement confirms me, if you just missed - here you see how it is to be fake, you will leave the policy alone as a man.
Then your excuses will be accepted as a deceitful man who made a mistake and carry his responsibility for her.
In the contrary, you will be concealed as without weaknesses that cannot be believed in the words or acts.
Or you want to be fierce, being a missing man or a life scheme.
You may think it's wrong when I celebrate you only, but you're a leader, and they're just a mixed sheep.
And you're a leader and you wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to slip your ears now, to buy the strength, to sit down here, and then to attack again, but so you're partially partyed or injured.
You're, like, in your eyes, your leader, the alpha soft, so take care of it.
Take the responsibility and leave the policy.
The Court locked the regulation on the procedure of stoping and searching persons in the police division in the NY
The Federal Revocation Court concluded on Thursday the Court of Justice, which requires amendments to stop and search persons in the police division in New York and refused from the case of judges.
The Second American Federal Court said that Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision would be revoked to the decision on the revocation of the city.
In August, the Court decided that the city had distorted the Constitution by implementing its programme of stoping and questioning people.
Instead of its conclusions and its right regulation, the decision to give a supervision that would help the police office to change its procedures and its school programme associated with them.
The Court of Auditors listened to the arguments for the requested derogation.
The Court of Justice said that the court must be revoked from the case because it had been in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judges, and that, as a judge, it did not agree to avoid the opinion of undertaking, partly because of the series of discussions with the media and public statements which she reacted to the criticism of the court.
The Court decided that the police officers had violated the citizens' rights of the tens of people when they were misleading the black and his ́nce in accordance with their programme of arrest and search of persons.
She established an independent monitoring to monitor the main changes of reform in the procedures, training and monitoring, and ordered the execution of the pilot programme for testing cameras on the body in some areas where it comes to the most frequent stop of persons.
In August, New York agreed to finish the method of storing names and address of people whose cases were rejected after police search.
The urgency of the town's revocation is sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
A number of civil rights protectors criticized the stop and search of persons.
In a certain form, there is a stop and search of persons for some decades, but mentioned views under the administration of the independent age Michael Bloomberg dramaticly increased at the recording start of 684 330 in 2011, in the most cases the black and Hisescence.
In 2004, four men who belonged to the minority, the case of the group's complaint, were recorded.
The maintenants of the changes of the programme of stop and search of persons conducted by the police division in NY say that changes will end injustices, increase the confidence and effectiveness of the police congregation and can affect the use of other police divisions.
The opposers claim that the changes are reduced by the police moral, but not by criminality, and that the money is lost, but it does not solve a wide problem when the police congregation is under pressure after the last decade has decreased its number of thousands of people.
The Court noted that she did not end the practice of stoping and searching persons that were constituting, but reformed the way that the police department's reviews were conducted in the NY.
Five purchase centres are affected by low visit
This results from data from the realistic advisory company of Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague Gods, the Business Centre of Krakov is opened and will be the 19th Prague Buying Centre.
Now there are 90 large business centers.
Uncomfortable performance is about 20 percent of large and large centers.
The problems are inadequately large centres against locality and bad layouts, so too much father or complicated and invisible passport arrangements, if possible the dead centre," Michal Sotak said from Cushman & Wakefield.
In addition, according to the management of Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five business centres are low visits.
The main debt belongs to my wrong transport accessibility, low receipt category of local residents or the precision of the market at that place.
Some projects opened almost completely, but their results were mainly uncomfortable at the beginning.
Today, the clients are sometimes to preserve and do not want to change their purchases.
The new business centre must be trying more to "launch" its clients on new marks on the market, entertainment, services and marketing actions," added Samadi.
The acquisition centres are generally stable, even in some centres, because the finders were willing to get out of the crisis and to purchase some units.
"But it is true that at the last time some projects have been opened which are not completely occupied and averagely decreased (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Popava, Shantovka in Olumouci), added Sotak.
The trade centres opened in the past two years are marketed very quickly, according to Sylvia Samadi.
The marketplace for new projects but exists.
The start of the appropriate places for the successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see a project building room that would serve the people of Prague 6.
On the market, the Space for the creation of smaller local projects, such as the "convinience centres", is sure on purchases and services of the daily need for residents in an unusual environment," said Samadi.
It also states that there is a place for another purchase centre on the foreign market.
And it is for a small "social" center, so for large projects in Prague, or in the middle of large projects, or extension in regional cities.
"Citizens like Kladno, Czech Republic, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," added Soták.
In Praza, the room for prepared business center on the Victory area is seen, in addition to May, according to the street potential on Prikopa and Václav.
"Intensively developing the expansion of detail parks that allow traders to cover and expansion into smaller cities for profitable and operational costs, room is also in some places for smaller local or sedimental purchase centres, respectively their restructuring such as the restructuring of business houses Prior, which is hard from good places," added DTZ Dyta Kubánk.
In Czechland, 90 modern purchases centres are currently located with over 2,2 million meters of fourth-screen floors.
The quarter of all these purchase centres is located in Prague.
Among 20 largest purchase centres, for the number of loans, nine of them are in Praza, comes from Incoma GfK data.
In the number of purchases, the CRC is under the EU, in comparison with British and France's values, and the Czech Republic remains about 50 metres of fourth per thousand of people.
Coulson got on the phone to check the guy.
The former news editor of News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson was obviously using the methods of "covering up to the phone, investigation and confrontation" to confirm a subwater type of charity relationship in which the former minister inside Charles Clarke should be involved.
The State Representative Andrew Edis at the Court of Old Bailey said that the news of the World was captured in May 2005 of false news that Clarke was seen with his “atracts” of special advice to Hannah Pa.
The news were confirmed by the private investigator Glenna Mulcauria to get into the Paõby's voice box and enter her private, but at the court, Coulson also called her and left her voice reports.
"The State Representative points out that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person who stands before the house and hopes that people will get out, but a person who does not judge people's stories to see what they say," Mr. Edis said.
He said that notW newspapers used three ways to test stories: getting into the phone, checking and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Clearly he knows about the second, the investigation, he's got to talk about her.
What's the first one?
He knows about getting in the phone?
He says no, we say, "But he knows."
The fame on the kindness of relationship that Clarke is involved was first imprisoned by the newspaper of NotW, when the resource that was sexually interested in Mrs. Paâbya was said, "You're just losing time, it's with Charles."
The voting report taken from her phone at at least three occasions was obtained in the Mulcair House in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private investigator where Mrs. Paīby and her sister were marked as “Projects”.
During the time when Ms. Paõby was investigated, her parents received anonymous phones in which they were requested for information about Paõby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, the former main rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup watched Mrs. Papaby's movement.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left the voice message, in which he told her: “I got a story that we want to issue tomorrow and I would have to talk to Charles very much about.”
Mr Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in history was the same model as in other important characteristics, among which the ex-Minist of the inside of David blutt belongs.
In the court, on Thursday, Coulson confronted Mr. Bluetta for a kind relationship with a given woman, while he himself saw Rebecca Brooks, who was then dedicated.
Coulson and Brooks were associated with other persons after the phone rental during the period from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup were admitted to get in the phone.
The NSA discovery increases the Community survey paranoid from the State
One day at the end of August, the German police officer was over the United States Consular Authority in Frankfurt, the main city of German economics.
On the order of the Social Authority for the Protection of the Institute (BfV), the German Home Rapporteur Agency, it was a mission to arrange the photograph of the American heads of the preserved guards located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BfV office hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of the audiences of Anthen, and this action has made a exchange of opinions in Berlin between the American and German Minister.
James ́per, the American National Rapporteur Director, again held that the United States did not use their business reporting options, "to steal trade secrets of enterprises in the benefits of the American companies and thus enhance their international competitiveness or increase their research."
But since the time that Edward Snowden, who became an informator from the collaboration, began to discover his valuable collection from the United States secret investigation, the European government and the former business officers no longer know whether they have the words of the director to believe.
After reports that the United Nations Safety Agency conducted a spinner in the Brazilian farming company and received access to the data with which the American cloud providers with Google and Yahoo have reached a general paranoia on the state of new dimensions.
The last cup came with discovering that Angely Merkel's phone was probably listened to ten years.
It may be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are most potential and pre-sectors.
Snowden reviewed the intensity of cooperation between American reporting services and companies.
I would say that these data are likely to be used for the mutual advantage.
"The Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi company, representing a small and central IT company in Germany.
According to the research issued in July, the EY advisory service, German companies are convinced that the United States now represents the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence that the United States have submitted trade secrets for fires to their own company in the entire documentation.
The policies were concerned that the EU missed certain skills in the IT and the Internet, and they noticed that it should try to limit its dependence to the United States:
The former employees are against that skeptic.
From the German Parliament, the vote will be rejected that they should have produced German Google.
I can just close the eyes and open them quickly again...
That's not the way, Hasso Plattner, President of the German SAP software company.
No one wanted a strong European IT priority, but he hadn't been allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany touches from car and farmers.
Everything except IT's industrial.
The range and technology of American Spanish Agencies discovered by Snowden are for some companies who later believed that China is the greatest threat of investigation, however shocking.
There is a great turn in the cloud-releasing technology where European representatives in a wide range realized that the data stored in the United States fall under the dark jurisdiction, so they are potentially attackable.
According to the survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, cca 10% of the Ne-American members after discovering the United States Prism has cancelled the plan to use a cloud supplier with a seat in the United States.
Jim Snabe, one of the general directors of SAP, says, "We have this new question for clients that haven't been there a year ago - where are my data stored and you can guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German higher factors suggest that the last reports are only the confirmation of what they already used: the powerful states want to decline their most precious secrets and these data must be protected for each price.
It's not a surprise that the economic spion is being conducted.
It's always done.
"It is a fundamental subject for many years, and it has not been significantly changed during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, the General Director of the Agrochemic Society of BASF.
The Americans have a spinner on us at business and industrial levels, as we do, because it is in our national interest to protect our business.
Business leaders generally do not want to glorify the anti-consideration that have affected the benefit of the attackers.
In the case of large companies, it is already implied that to take a free memory USB disk or to leave an unsaved notebook in the hotel room is at least incompatible.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Car representation, says that it has been a long time to collect a mobile phone before the meeting, so that it is not possible to be used as auditors.
The German BfV Agency advises the leaders to consider whether to use simple mobile mobile phones for the risk that smart phones can be checked.
Pre-payed mobile phones will be released afterwards.
However, there is anxiety that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hackership and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies have a global market representative in their specific characteristics.
“Multiful and medium-sized enterprises are often missing experience, personal and financial resources to protect the enterprise secrets effectively against unemployed access” warns in their BfV report.
The United States warns its own company against economic spending from other countries.
According to the letter of Washington post American documents National Intelligence Estimate introduced in February to France with Russia and Israel in the second range of hosts who participate in hacker activities for economic reporters, and soon in China.
The member of the Council in the German free risk company concluded that, as regards the economic spiral, the French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal reporting agency DCRI, declared this month in one of the discussions: “The services are very well concluded that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, perform a spionship on their associations.”
Parents of an unflying boy from Georgia, who died in a strange accident, they think he was killed
Parents of an unflying boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside the smooth armed spirits in the body of his middle school, believe that their son was killed, the lawyer of the family said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta City in Georgia was found on 11 January in a balanced spirit behind courts in the body-wide school where he walked.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County's surrounding the conclusion that Johnson died in an emergency case, but the family of a 17-year-old youth will refuse it.
"They are uniquely convinced that their son was murdered," for FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin ́mp, representing Kennetha and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it resists logic, physical laws and healthy understanding," he said.
It seems that it is to be able to break out what happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"How they used to send their son to school, and he returned to them in the question of the dead," he said.
The State Representative Michael Moore on Thursday said that Johnson's death investigation was conducted and noted that a number of key questions remained unresponsible.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a consequence of crime?
He announced Moore at the printing office on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to watch if they tell me anywhere.
My goal is to prove the truth.
"I think there is a sufficient basis for running investigation," he said.
Moore reported to the journalists that the physician pitty indicated that Johnson was dead as a result of the "poetry destruction".
However, the second pitch, according to Moore, introduced another cause of death.
"There are several questions to be answered or confirmed here," he said.
Moore added that if Johnson's death finds sufficient evidence for the order to investigate criminal acts or violate civil rights, the FBI and his execution requests.
The representative of the sheriff office from the circuit of Lowndes was not available on Thursday for an eventual comment.
The judge from South Georgia in the middle officials ordered to provide all the videos available from the monitored cameras that investigators have watched.
Young parents hope that video records will include the track leading to discover how their son died.
Center CDC issued for schools of the Directive on allergies in children
In the Centre for Prevention and Control of illness (CDC) the file of guidelines to help in the case of children's allergies for food in school.
It's the first file of the United States directives issued, and it's because the number of children of schools suffering allergies on food.
One of the 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The CDC center found that the production of food allergies in children was 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The Directives include information for schools on how the leader congregation and the staff to know about children's allergies on food and how to respond to allergic reactions, if it happens.
In addition, schools recommend to have adrenalin available – most often uses the EpiPen brand automatic injector – to be able to respond to potentially dangerous survival.
State legal authorities have recently updated rules that allow schools to save adrenalin easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms appearing in conversations with children with allergic reactions.
The kid can say, "It's like someone's getting me into the language," "I feel that I'm in the language of a chlupy" or "I am a Witness of my tongue."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "neurological generations"
Germany became the first European nation, which recognises the third section of the children born with an insignificant generation.
Newborn kids have already been assigned to a man or a woman's family.
The new law from parents does not require that such children enter any generation and allow them to introduce the heading as "neurity" or "unspecified" on their family lists.
The aim of the law is to stop pressing parents to decide increasingly on their child for the operation of the determination of the sex, and to fight discrimination against intersexual.
A intersexual person according to BBC for many years said, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna stay a late physician created, injured and discovered.
It is estimated that every year a child is born one that is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, parts of the group of approximately 60% which fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, which break termin for those who have atypical chromoemiates, polycarbons (wheelers or varlates) or unusually developed genitality.
Intersexual could be Wallis Simpson.
The definition of the section is not yet completely comprehensive, but the majority of the experts in the United States says that if they cannot specify a seed, it is better to use the best available information and to determine them, instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is carried out, if all.
The New York psychiater, Dr. Jack Drescher, specialised on the issues of a gender, said that the new German law “seems like a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in life a threatening condition that requires operations, but in the number of children it is not so," he said.
The definition of the section can be carried out without operation and then can wait for the development of the identity.
The knowledge of how your child develops the responsibility is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why it is.
It's like a mystery why some people are homosexual.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not linked to the sect, but to their biological building, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically associated with both and cannot be defined as none of them.
These drawings can be displayed in a secondary division of characteristics such as the sugar volume, hair growth, puls and station, in primary sexual characteristics such as multiplying authorities, or in the structure of chromoum and hormones.
This report also provides a review of discrimination which includes intersexual and transsexual people in the work, as well as a level of disturbance, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't correspond to any generation now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark in the official documents of men, women or "third generation".
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australia, became the first worldwide recognised “unseen” person when he wined a court revocation to keep the status of the “uncertain” section until the end of life.
According to the Ministry of the Inner Ministry, German passes will be included other than M (man) and F (female) and the third indication, X, for intersexual persons.
In the neighbouring France, reporting to France, 24 problems are still contrary.
In 2011, the decades of French legislators from this strong Catholic country signed a fifth to be removed from the school teachers “the theory of generation”.
The American website Catholic online also dismissed the German Law and wrote: “In the way the world is set up to a new condition when the seed is a question of choice, but the sexual activity never, we convert two other pillars of civilization.”
One mother who was born from Maryland also said to Baby zone that she would like to see that she had a child's seed at birth.
“The parentality alone is stressing, even without other restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child's seed,” she issued for the websites relating to family care.
Children have stability and security.
History children with a man and women's seed were called hermafrodite, according to the visional Greek, which had a two-seed.
And about ten years ago, the medical community believed that the seal was something like a table that could be deleted and drawn again.
But now many doubt the ethical foundation of the operation because the responsibility is complex matters, and the doctors may sometimes decide wrong, because they do not know how children will feel when they grow.
"In half of the 20th century, it was called psychiatric ready," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call psychiater, but chirurg.
The overcoming theory about how to handle children with an insignificant seed, was presented by Dr. John Money at the University of Johnse Hopkins, who thought that the seed was undergoing.
He created a new concept of “appeal” and argumented that social causes and influences — as parents raised their child — affected children’s genes and hormones and created a child without acknowledge whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theory became violent.
For the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged because of the bad circumcision, he recommended that their children let their own child be completely astray, remove his barlets and educate her as a girl.
"The Media presented this case as a successful case of change, but it was different," Drescher said.
When a boy was 15 years old, he left her back to the boy and married her.
Nevertheless, for 38 years, he was injured by self - killing.
Drescher said that some doctors "use this model" are used in today.
But in the 1990s, with the Internet arrival, these operations have been discovered by “income with the outcome”.
It was also Jima Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with men's chromosomes, but insignificantly instructed.
The doctors were not sure if he had a big clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live “a pleasant life. ”
So so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's chirurgicals were removed by external organs and varlates and was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones for 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said for ABCNews.com.
I was amazing, but it was very hard to ask.
On 18th, he was sent to the plastic of the seal.
But because he was depressed and learned that something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrible.
After my birth, I was sterilized and no one told me anything.
Bruce was born with the disorder of the development of the seed (DSD), which prohibited the body to produce a sufficient quantity of testosteron so that it could develop properly its staff.
After he learned the truth, he changed himself back to man, took the dose of testosteron and let him remove the puls,
Operations caused his unfruitfulness.
Today, it represents other in the organization called Interface Project and is trying to normalize the ideas of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, manager of the Advocates for informed choice (informed electors) with the seat in California, fears that the German Law “invoke to the consciousness and stigmates”.
“Multiple activists are afraid that the German law will achieve the encouragement of parents to make decisions and to choose ‘neurity’ for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it's going to be an intervention.
We think it's better to allocate a man or a woman's head and then wait.
But we don't know how the law finally comes out, so everything we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian Law, because “to allow adults to choose to be incorporated into the third section”.
"The adult should be able to influence the right of its own decision," she said.
The German law wants to allocate it when he was born.
It's a battle that a little kid wouldn't have to be born at this moment.
When they grow, they can make their own body decisions.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radio lady from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a rape of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a supporting group, said that the German law "toowing power" to parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with men's chromosomes, but the DSD's name is a syndrome of incidence on androgens.
Because her androgen recipients are valid, Katie's women's drawings have developed.
He's got a vagine, but he's not a worker and a boyfriend.
Now the 29-year-old Katie is given, and in the study of the University in Pennsylvania, she works as a stagista in child psychiatries.
Although she is unfruitful, she hopes that she will become a parent by adoption or replacement mother.
"The law gives the parents a certain room to not make their decisions prosper," Baratz said.
It gives them time to perform certain tests and think and gives them time before they write "man" or "women".
In this regard, it's all right – you grow up and love your child.
You have an intimate child, and you're happy about it.
You don't have to be quick with an operation that's unnecessary.
"It makes the possibility to participate in the decisions and children and takes up the usual that parents associate because they have no sure they do the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which he has more accusation — and that is a wonderful thing.
It gives children the right to do their own decisions.
The drunk pooled the whole house with the benzine: He threatened that he was subjected to his own family!
The pressure increased, the fear was decreased.
The man started to threaten that the whole house was underlined.
Instead, all available police guards in the surrounding area, as well as the young Boleslave farmers unit and the voluntary assembly.
The police officer also arrived at the place that men tried to speak his irrational behavior.
The man's still threatened that the house was undergoing.
She had to get inside the house, so she was supposed to get out of the box that the husband had disappointed and shot.
Then the Agressor ended the investigation in the young boyfriend, from which he was transferred to an anti-alcohol fun station.
Finally, the hastic house of the police benzine was cut off with a sorbent that they had quietly.
Furthermore, all home animals were saved from the house.
The police officer didn't have a man, so he was ordered.
Report: Obam's campaign thought to change Biden for Hillary Clinton
The nearest adviser of President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times letter, thought secretly to replace the candidate from 2012 Vice-President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton.
This discovery is the most significant feelings of not long-termly expected campaign books from Mark Halperin and John Heilemanna “Double down: Game Change 2012”.
The magazine Times received a copy of the entry books and announced on Thursday evening that the president's top co-operation organized at the end of 2011 intencies of group meetings and investigations to consider whether the release of Bidena would help to rescue Obam's bleeding for the rehabilitation.
According to the national-political journalist Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a basic record of the efforts of leaders within the campaign and in the White House, namely the former leader office of Bill Daley's White House, to see how the elections should be moved by the former ministerial of Clinton to the post of the Vice-President.
The potential change was an extremely sustained secret for the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and within the Ovarial work.
Only a few of the nearest advisers – including Daley, the former Chief of Obam's campaign of Jim Messina and the former main advisers in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – believed that this change was considered.
The book Double down states that Daley was a representative of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that until the time they finally decided not to overcome this step when the data showed that the addiction of Clinton on the candidate would not increase the opportunity of obama.
In the conversation with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administrative justice was considered to replace Biden Clinton.
"I've intensely examined a number of things and this was one of them," he said for the Daley's letter.
You should not forget that the President had a terrible view at that time, so we said, "Christ, what are we to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as a "inquired care", Martin said to Anderson Cooper from CNN that the campaign for re-electing has invested a small investment in order to ensure whether this will be paid in the elections.
"In the campaigns, such money are not being taken for elections and quality research, if something is not really seriously considered," Martin said at 日360.
However, it is not possible that Obama realized that his team considers this change.
Martin told the CNN that he asked Daley whether his leader had been in the case of this potential incoming card.
While Daley said that he didn't think that the President had the potential changes of "Bil·dom", the former leader of the Office admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had said about it.
Martin added that the book Double down definitively does not answer the question whether the political survey has been reached to Obam's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama was not aware of the research on the exhibition of Biden from the candidate.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
The fantastic wound that lights in the dark?
The British undertaking produced the first shadow that lights in the dark – for the use of medus.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this sea animal and developed a worldwide flash.
He came to the idea when he read a professional debat on medus, and convinced the chin farmers to produce chemicals a white that causes the worldwide.
This wound reacts with the consumer language – increases the white-coated pH cold and then causes its backup.
Chris says that the flashing lights when he reacts with your mouth warm, and so what more you lie, it's more severe.
Charlie, the founder of the "Lick me I'm delicious" company, says: "It's a substance, but if it's about production, we're at the beginning, so you'll get about 2 g of this substance for 200 GBP."
The bicycle we use in the mixture reacts with your language in neutral pH.
So, as your mouth is white, the pH level is increased and the wheat begins to cover.
We tested it in the past few months, and it seems to be a great idea of celebration of Halloween, because it causes this fantastic harmful effect.
It's probably the most dear worm I've ever produced, because the lighting of medusy is four times less than gold.
So I'm worth about 140 GBP.
But it's pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company with the seat in Bristol is known for its non-radical cup of beer, syrers, bottles and gold lips.
His next product must be more ambitional.
He says, "I really would like to make an invisible wound."
In my basic case, it's impossible for the roof of the ice cristal, which makes a frozen, but I'll count that we're going to find the way we can do it.
Small uses fluorescent properties of medus, artificially produced by Chinese.
Halloween 2013: According to number
When I was young, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I could eat sweetness, stay upstairs and lead to the neighbors to the overflow.
I feel that I've become anxious today.
Two years later, there was no sugar in my apartment and this year probably something else.
But they show that I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
According to the State Small Business Federation (NRF), this year will celebrate Halloween’s Americans – in 158 million of them – and will lose $6,9 billion for sweetness, costs and holidays.
But everyone's happy about Halloween, there's trends.
According to NRF, $6,9 billion is expected to go 1,2 billion per costume.
This year are the last shooting of sexy unleavened objects.
Sexy must no longer be women; sexy can also be food as pizza, hamburger and mrkev.
It's about a man, I'm expecting to see a lot of zombies by the dead, and I'm surprising that the universe men from Daft Punk will take it to our channels in Instagram for years.
According to Google's company, they are the most cosmic zombies, Batman, pirates and scarlets.
I guess there's nothing wrong about it, walking according to tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs and we weren't the only one for my wonder.
In the United States, according to NRF, this year will lose 330 million dollars on costumes for animals.
So he'll see a lot of pleasant dogs.
It's about sweetness, we don't work time.
According to Nilsen Americans, $1.9 billion is lost.
It's about 300 million kg of Hershey table, lift, sweetness Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark.
This is an individual report for 41 million colleagues who, according to the US Trade Minister, want to overcome our quarter.
At the time of Halloween, we buy, and believe not, and we consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is sugar bonbons, and yet, according to the National Association, they sell about Halloween approximately 16 thousand tonnes.
It's about 9 billion individual kitchen bonbons.
It's a secret I've never heard.
Nothing for Halloween is more typical than a horrible house.
They have the best names such as "Terror behind the walls" (Search for walls, which is outside the processing) "Ho-O-Scream" (eco, rhev) and "The house of shock" (Home shock).
In the United States there are officially dedicated 1200 horrible houses, which have 500 million dollars from the United States, and that belongs to the incredible billions on which you are fearing and gives your friend on Facebook, and you cannot remove them and the person you like will look and add a comment as "beauty faces".
And finally, a little bit about the darkness.

Schwarzenberg: We have preliminary options here for two years
President TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another preliminary option.
A week after the last discussion for Currently.ch said that the other east is not and every government has come from voting last Friday and the Sabbath is impossible blind.
"It can't keep it," said Karel Schwarzenberg with that the lifetime of the starting electoral period is estimated to two years.
"I think it's gonna be a little more exported decision."
In addition, President TOP 09 does not admit that its side could still lose elections as a year (in 2010, a summary of 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg considers that if it was within two months that the preliminary options would be, the United Nations movement will be forwarded to Andrey Babische.
In the contrary case, according to Schwarzenberg, Baby will lose.
Turbulentity in the CSSD, where President Bohuslav Sabbath after the approved Irish Meeting of the Party, stated that in the management of the social democracy, either he or Michal Hashek, Schwarzenberg would remain after his:
"The leaders of the Democratic Party as little boys are going behind the head of the State to allow them to turn back."
"I thought Mr. Hashek was worse and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen something so stupidly done in my life," added President TOP 09.
And in the direction of the President of Zeman (with which he kissed in the fight against the Presidency) he said, "The role of the heads of the State is: He wants to strengthen the side."
The TOP 09 has already submitted the law.
What was the most surprise for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first claims of laws in Snevnie, other than the Pharisean register of the agreements which have been collected before the elections, but has fallen under the table with the preliminary elections.
President TOP 09 in the discussion for currently.ch claims that such ability is given by "these laws are necessary".
Equally, but TOP 09 is clearly wanting to preach the surrounding trials from other sides.
For example, the ANO's electoral leader Martin Komárek committed TOP 09 in a pre-optional fight from the idea of introducing the United Nations contracts register "decreasing" movement programme.
TOP 09 now uses a shock - just exhausted a ling, which had already been increased in the second snippet reading.
Haszel units have come to save lost wood, which has reached 15 meters above the land on a dangerous rocking
Ruby's bathroom fled after a little accident.
Three days later, the prisoner in the rock was cut off a man who was hungry with the dog.
The Hassians went down in the wall to save the dog from certain death.
The wall was released by fire units, which accepted it to be released after the same way, on a dangerous exhibition of 15 meters above the earth.
The nine months older Ruby fled after a small car rental on Sunday, and three days he survived until he was released out of the rock in the middle.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) with their friend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit rock in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and salvation service from West Yorkshire.
After he fled when he arrived in a small accident, the horse after his lost dogs were watched and placed challenges on social networks.
In the middle of approximately 14,15, the bistroscale peasant of Ruby's whisper looked at an exhibition of 15 meters above the earth.
Instead, a technic salvation team from the Cleckheaton fire station and switched down to release Ruby, using his exhibition after the stone of the cargo for animals.
The professional leader of the Technical Saving Team Andyyton said: The dog was in danger.
It was directly at the wall of the wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
When he was saved, he didn't shoot the brain – he was totally hungry.
It's all right now.
And then he got the throats.
It was a very unusual outcome.
It's that someone's kidding, you're incredible.
The professional leader of the Technical Saving Team Peter Lau said, "The rubs had great happiness during his flee."
She was here to be very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian on the watch, and other than the excitement and dehydration was okay.
Sle Halla from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was afraid, looking at a salvated action."
Moreover, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was able to keep him back in the hand.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall down.
The Hassians took a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We're very thankful to them. Everyone was just bitter.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid he could fall, but he stayed there."
Hassians were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that after that, Katy Perry was not determined.
During the interview of the Australian vote order, this pop star this week said that the song “Old habits die hard” of 2004 had been a song for the Jagger.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had this rock veteran at the dinner, and he went after her.
And she added, "It was a long time, and now it is very nice to me."
In the declaration of the quarter of Jagger (70) the representative said that the category refuses to do Katy Perry to us.
The supplier said, "You may take him with someone else."
Perry was one of the hosting songs (singers) who had been located in the Rolling Stones Concert School for years.
Her new Prism album debuted this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Separated Europe gives Scotches to the choice
Next day, another terrible story of independence.
This time the warning is shown that the submin for the membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its access to Schengen.
This was the cause of the stories on pass controls in Berwick and Hadrian's wall was decreased.
The truth is that Strathclyde's newspapers mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as it was expected, it did not change the news titles.
No one has also mentioned that the EU Member States will take a lot of time by adapting their official laws, if they do.
Since Scotland is not now in Schengen, the proposal of continuing non-soulation would be a loan for whatever they want from Scotch.
So it's a low story.
Moreover, so old that it became a burst. The newspaper that “ independence means pass controls” I heard at least 40 years ago.
However, one interesting thought is hidden in this youth speaker.
Why should it be expected that the independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why do you change London shopping for that Brussels, especially now?
This is a huge European story: a great military plan to join Europe has finally been consumed.
The impact of the euro crisis is officially a project of Europe's death.
In addition to Europe, it will be affected by the party’s dedicated opposition to the EU or the derogation of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party alternativa for Germany, which was based in this year, came as a result and already used at a series of federal elections at least five million votes from Bundestago, which is based on the "out" Free Democrats (British Liberal Democrats Equator).
On the home ground, the opposite to the plan was to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis became a decision-making moment.
The opposition of Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the cross-border indicators involved in the national economics, has brought many people to the view that Europe's project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro is only a little common with that the national governments are economically equipped with a high budgetary stage – it was only true in Greece.
Moreover, it's the euro system that blocks its members on the changed corners for German exporters, and the German policies want to keep it.
Without the possibility to devalve domestic currencies, South Europe has a house-wide production from Germany's outcome.
The only help is to meet income and public expenditure – to which Germany is assigned.
As a result of current problems with the budget and exchange, the deepest cause of European small performance is.
As a result of the "Green" energy policy supported by Brussels – the Code for the support of French and German fires on the costs of consumers – is the European future two times more than electricity and four times more for benzine than this in the United States.
This is a parallel income in the costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Never any payment in the world would turn back to the depreciation of the European petrochemical industrial of the left breast-feeding of the United States.
The consideration is a crucial rebellion, particularly in France, at the time of the EU's overseer.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will keep Germany up and allow Paris to set up at Washington level in the world.
However, Berlin, as a demonstration of political legitimacy, has already been demonstrated by Paris and has sentenced his own economic policy in Europe and the French economy renewed his judgment.
Consequently: The right floor of Marine Le Pennov, the Anti-European National Front, just wined basic additional options and sent the Governing Socialist to the third place.
The front is now 24% of the most famous part of France – the timely warning for the British people that they cannot be able to believe that the rights feeding automatically will be positively shown on the left.
How does Le Penova have its new acquisition of popularity among the white worker class?
European elections in the next year would be used to create an anti-European block of action against the common currency through the European Parliament.
The anti-European parties will never speak well in these options, which is probably likely, can dominate such a block first in the history of the European Parliament.
I believe that at the appropriate time the anti-European feelings and stand against the common currency are connected and the euro will lose.
The EU will not disappear, but the change will be more free in the meaning of the "Europes (Suverenes) nations", already predicted General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economy may leave euros, but France and South Europe will restore their own currencies.
I hope that the Great Britain will be remote from this project and will join the United States.
However, the increased interest of Washington about the Pacific indicates that British will be left to the Atlantic Chloe.
And where is Scotland?
We could choose to be a little little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests – it is also the opportunity to inform Berlin and Brussels when we have to be.
I guess that Scotland would have been a good way in the released organization of Europe because it would keep its own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries would be easier in the non-federal Europe.
In the contrary, they had to take an example from Norway and keep their economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is — purchasing – the most successful political movement in Europe, which wined a large majority in 2011, thanks to the opposite position against the ships that planned (and implemented) the Officer Alistair Darling and the next coalicy of conservators and liberal democrats.
It would be fun if Scotland now would like independence only to adopt a suspicious measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Honest pubertation: Advanced Previous
The investigation showed that African and Spanish have reached puberts before their white pillars.
Physical changes do not mean that the pubert is close
It is not demonstrated that hormones or other chemical substances are followed
Experts claim that one of the launchers may be an obsession epidemic.
Trend's the first puberty is not so clear in the boys.
Ancient reporter CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes the health of children and family problems.
Should her mother be scared when her daughter starts growing your finger and swallowing up for 7 or 8 years of age?
In the American Academia of Children, this week in Orland in Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common between American girls and represents a new standard.
"For a long time, I made my parents assured that this is usually not a sign of the development in the direction of the full puberty," said Kaplowitz
Visible characters of development, such as growth of the hair, the inflammation of the fire and in the undersight and the body feed, appear before the girls.
Nevertheless, in the last 40 years, it was only a small move in the first menstruation.
In the United States, the average of 12,5 years of age in 1970 is now more than 12,75 years.
"When they start developing the bridge, they will run at least two to three years before it comes to the first menstruation," said Caplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Co > With This Common Problem" (Early pubert in girls: Required manual for this common problem)
The best test of how the pubert will continue is time.
It is discussed on what the start of the puberty is active, but if the growth of the hair is made by a growth question before 8 years, the girl is considered as "previous growth".
In most cases, the process is quiet or stopped – which children’s doctors can monitor carefully.
Increasing growth may be a d– to perform the tests of endocrinologists for the elimination of serious problems, such as the throat or the cystas.
There are therapy procedures that lack time menstruation and prevent the following effects: the preliminary age of the bone that can finally lead to the stop of growth and increasing growth in adults.
Recommendations regarding medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the child’s ability to develop, growth and emotional growth.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
It is about medication, Caplowitz is cautious, but it recognises that “the treating of puberty can mix the problems with the behavior of a girl and its feelings that it is different from its kinds of poetry”.
Intelligent is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to menstruate.
"They're afraid he can hurt, or how he's going to control hygiene," said Caplowitz.
"It was a shock," a woman whose daughter began to have a menstruation in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came from school home scared and scared that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of the pre-temporary puberty.
However, there is not yet a related file of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemical substances in § or sexual messages in media.
Boys – like girls – get puberts before.
Caplowitz suggests that the most serious deficiency is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to study girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the body tube with the pubertation.
Additional discovery supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors.
In this country, African and Spanish have the ability to reach the puberts before their white rocks.
Explanations are different.
Globally it seems to be affected by some of the possible economic submissions throughout the air to the gene.
Other mistakes: Although boys are already in the low place of the face and in the winter, the trend towards the full flow of a time pubert is not as clear as it is in the girl.
Other doctors have added additional complications to this subject to the American Children’s associations (AAP).
Actions and covering are even running at which and in which football.
"We must be careful about how we identify the puberty approach," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrical endocrinologist from the Goryeb Child disease in Morristown in New Jersey.
Parents should not be able to get a command from their child’s doctor to talk to their child.
"It can mean the need to talk to the child before you assume," Caplowitz advised.
You'll never be calm, your child's probably going to react well.
The girls who are developing earlier assured that even if it is so preliminary, this process is a part of life.
Convalink's survival in the economic role.
He's got a new job?
The Nadja Konvalink (62) came out in the economic role, and it was the power of it.
Maybe a favorite Czech hero would plan to change the profession and make business in the field?
Konvalink's Naidia appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and hit the beer there.
I've done it first in my life, and I just got it.
The boss even offered me to work for me and I could live with a bird's shot.
But I refused to stay at what I'm doing today, in heritage," led Convalink's smile, who was a host on the twenty-year-year work of the Irish economy.
"I have a Irish bird and I'll give a whiskey here," she caused her cute whiskey.
On the action, Nadi, a long friend and colleague Paul New, also appeared.
I am after death and I can't cry in this new life.
I have allowed one beer or one pannaco daily, and I'm trying to keep it," added heric.
Aeroplane manufacturers with a wide range of seats, in the seat are large prohibitions
Among the leaders of the flying producers, the breadth of the seat in the second class was destroyed in a long distance, which resulted in the cause of the bitter exchange of views on the airport show in Dubai.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for in the remote aircraft for the economic class – not exactly what the aircraft companies would generally prejudice, but which is the key to the effectivity in the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
The Airbus company called this week to industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm a large seat in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says that it would be able to decide.
The complaint was established in the time when the air manufacturer competed in the sale of the largest version of his two-motor remote aircraft with the potential record number of negotiations expected during the action from 17 to 21 November.
The way the final part of the aircraft is distributed — particularly if it is 9 or 10 seats – is based on economic performance in the new ‘mini-jumbo’ airports.
The Boeing Society says that the improved model "777X" will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm based on 10 in each row.
Airbus community says that the competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm broad economic seats distributed after 9.
Aeroplanes often attack each other in the technical issues of advertising in professional media.
Airbus now before a flying show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to get a overview with more than 100 negotiations, calls directly to public.
Recently, he showed what could be by starting a new advertising war when the financial people showed a picture showing three persons in the restaurant with the title "Do you like it?"
"Boeing propagates the long-term years in seats of benefit than in regional turbobertle aircrafts," said Airbus John Leahy's leader sales.
As the feeding forces change, people are more sensitive, but the airport is not radically changed.
Since the beginning of the 70th year, when Boeing 747 Jumbo defined the modern distant air transport, the weight of the median American was increased by 10 per cent in the oversight of the United States Health Ministry.
According to American health, the prominent American is in the 21th century in a pass of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of a seat of 50 years when the average width of the new baptized airplane was lower.
The Airbus company states that it has conducted a research that indicates that the extension of the seat of 2,5 cm will improve the quality of the sleep by 53 per cent.
The Boeing dimensions of Airbus seats refused and said that it was not able to decide how aircraft companies export taxes and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the results in the cabine depend on more issues than only on the width of the seat.
"The reality is to provide flexibility to the aircraft company and to allow them to perform things that are convinced that they have to do to succeed," said the expert on the Kent-ver cabine room.
They don't want to, and they dictate to them what brings them profits.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For travelers it is the main space for locks, but for the suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect the expenditure.
In this context, the consequences of the aircraft with the estimated trade in the next decades of at least 700 billion dollars in the catalog prices are sufficient for the extent of the American and European export jazz.
As she said in July of the Agency, the seat divorce is exactly what fighting between the last flights.
Like Airbus, so Boeing states that they are reaching at their last two-motor distant airports with 20% better ability than the leader of the market representative in this segment, model Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boeing's exercise claims are partly dependent on the comparison of the model 777X design with 10 seats in order and concept 777 with 9 seats in order.
The winning in unit costs is deceived by the 10-year-old concept.
"D; why Boeing does this is to encourage more seeds, and has made its aircraft more competitive than our products," Kevin Keniston, leader of the travellers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analyzers say that cabines with 10 seats in order to existing models 777 are in accordance with the fact that many travellers are for a wide range that can take hands in hand with lower payments.
"Firty-five meters a wide seat would be great for the traveler, but the reality is that Airbus's business view is motivated by the threat of the 777 model," said the Professor for Mary Kirby's internal cabine, the founder and portal editor, Mary Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't add a seat, but they offer the aeronautical company a directory of suppliers to be able to choose.
Aeroplane sellers even carry a measured vessel with them to check competitive arrangements.
As long as I agree, all producers also offer aircrafts with a highly cruel arrangement for the underlying company and regional travellers.
Airbus offers a model A350 with 10 seats in order, but he says he hasn't sold it yet.
The Airbus also highlighted the need for more cabin adjustment so that he offered a larger seat in some of his aircrafts.
The experts say that without the support of the other producer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unexpected, but it can be released from the wheel sales 777X.
The beginning of HIV-addicted virus overflowed in Praza Millennium
In the Republic of Czech Republic, the number of crossed growth each year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, for five years later, 121 and 180 in 2010.
Loni was killed 212 and it was a record number.
"On the fact that the total number of new-related cases will overcome 200 years, I think it's no doubt," said the expert on the AIDS Miroslav Hlavati problem, which led the Prague House of Light for Patients a year.
According to the end of January to September, 165 HIV patients were in the country, and for the same period, they were 176.
The tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women from the beginning of the investigation to the end of the aeroplane, most affected in Prague.
Their group arrived in September 1005.
In the Middle County, the residence of 206 were infected.
The diagnosis also heard 156 people from the country of Jihomo, 130 from Mo’Scossel, or 116 from Usteck.
At least the deceased coming from the Highness, they were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were affected in sex.
Fourteen people have been commanded in the past during blood transfusion.
However, this case has not occurred since the beginning of the test, then in more than the fourth century, in the CR.
With HIV source, six children were also born, and they were transferred from their mother.
The uncertainties in the film are, but looked is beautiful, strong experts.
Fantastic film from the Universe Gravitatation Like time after Premier, he sold cinema in Czech.
On October, it was seen by the Union by film distributors of approximately 150 thousand wheels and produced more than 26 million crowns.
Most recensions are positively valued.
Others, however, are found in it.
Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from a number of astronomes and astrophics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed the incidences that had occurred in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of Stars and Planetaries Brno): I have decade-fantastic films that I consider modern, dreams.
The Gravity Film doesn't take out, even though it's like "fisically real" representation.
It's not, but it doesn't mean it's bad.
I used him too much.
You can notice the need of Sandry Bullock's hair, which doesn't know anyway in the situation of trouble.
Hubb's kosmical division and the International Cosmic stations are moved by extremely different running roads, so they cannot be seen in one collection.
Some film whispers calculate an unreally effected effect and all the behavior of fire in the state of unfortunateness.
Scafandry would also not be able to keep such a thing.
Herds in the Gravitatation movie often get into the colise with different objects and clothes without any more power.
Criticals weren't hidden or the applet.
The tragedy on the current road of the Earth is so largely unrealistic, according to some discussing.
Moreover, she wonders why the doctor was sent to the universe to perform technology.
People in the forests are also talking about "never real" behavior of lan.
This looks like it's designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Directive of Stars and planetaria hl. m. Praha): I saw him at the width place, but I could simply say, I was surrounded.
I'm sure it wasn't a documentary movie, but science-fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (instead the obligation) to keep the reality successfully.
"More than you mentioned inequality, I was concerned about how a cosmic station has been shown three times with degrading rate of technology (the Chinese consequences)."
"Chinese will finally be until the end of the decade, and it's likely looking better than in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (Directive of the Astronomical Charter of Academy & C): In computerically generated scenes, the authors are very efficiently trying to not violate physical laws, so naturally oriented rounds evaluate that in various space collisions and swords, it is properly maintaining the moment of hypocrisy, said by physics, as well as the view of the Earth from the universe, is very realisticly tender atmosphere and the polycaric square that moves to the polars.
Incompatibleness will certainly be found in more detailed examination.
For example, when reading comments, I made sure that the preferred direction of the different space wheel on the current road appears in some scenes to be rotated before it should be (of the western to the east).
Jiří Štepán (Astronomic Institute of Academy Others): Some things have been adapted to their needs, but no principle and in heaven calling for sin against logic or natural laws I have not recorded in the film, and in comparison with other films of similar attitude is to see that the creators have been involved in the events shown.
From moments that don't give sense it is to name that Hubbl's universal distant view is covered by otherwise broken orbits than ISS.
The investigation is very different, and the salvation operations would therefore not be able to continue as shown in the movie.
Then, at the time of the division of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) I didn't notice that the whole ISS would rotate, so there is no power that affects Kowalskia, which makes both actors to leave at the time they're not moved.
New vaccine against nikotin can remove comfort from raw
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nikotin, which can remove the rejoicing from the fucking cigarette.
The only dose of vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for the whole life from the dependency on nikotin.
Before tests on people, you need to conduct further tests that will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the health faculty Weill Cor in New York says that the first signs are good.
"We hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of bowls who have tried to stop and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but have seen that their dependence on nikotin is so strong to overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cor©.
The new vaccine contains an insufficient virus that has been established so that it can carry genetic information for creating anti-nicotine anti-inflammation.
The virus selectively affects the jater cells that will then start to create a gas flow through these anti-aliases.
Protectives follow all nitrogen molecules in the cross and neutralize them before they get into the brain, which prevents the bullshit to get the nitrogen principles.
In the tests of vaccinated mouse, added to nikotin, they continued in their current activity.
But the mouses that were not vaccinated “smoothed up, ” said researchers, which is the sign that nikotin had reached them into the brain.
The experiments are described in the magazine Science Translatation Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained anti-tabs.
Injections have to be given so often to maintain sufficient anti-alias levels, so they appear as sweet and non-praktic.
The costs for the new vaccine should be much lower because they convert the jater cells to the manufacture of anti-fabrics.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccines for people are absolutely safe, they could be given to the children before they have a silence of cigarettes to try, and it would be so dependent on nikotin.
But most likely they would use it to stop.
"They'll be able to think that when they start smoking again, they'll have no benefit from the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them to escape this crime," he said.
The British students said that the results were interesting, but they advertise that they need another research.
Tripodi's supposed to affect Obeid.
The former minister of the New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for Corruption.
The former Minister for the New South Wales Joe Tripodi claimed that he would change the political policy of maritime debt on requesting his political leader Eddie Obeida, who had serious interests in three possibilities on the Government's controlled territory.
The independent committee against corruption (ICAC) broadcasts on Friday on whether Mr. Obeid was stuck with some State ministers to be a purchasing to the Circular Quay, where Obeido had two restaurants and café, renewed without having to participate in the election procedure after his release in August 2005.
The committee now examines the statement that Mr. Tripodi had concluded that Mr Obeida was interested in these inabilitys, which was based on the evidence submitted on Thursday, the former representative of Mr. Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the Government insisted on the promotion of public concurrences.
The purchasers were against it and also wanted more contractual submissions.
In 2009, the acquisitions for businesses in Circular Quay, which were offered to Obeid 2,5 million dollars annually, were renewed without need for public concurrence.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Appeals from February 2006 to November 2009, was a public concurrence beneficiary.
But he claimed that changes were made on the request of Mr Obeida, which, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, invited to move in the governmental payment policy.
The ICAC talks reported showed the talks from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripodim and Steve Dunnn, the leader of the officer, who came to the resort of offices after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
"Has the subject of discussions through these phone talks developing the policy of commercial procurement?", asked Commissioner Anthony Whealy of Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi answered.
I can't remember what we're talking about, but, of course, not about this.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obeidem.
The Israeli military aircraft attacked the goal in Syria, said the responsible factor
The Israeli military airports were held on Thursday night in the Syrian Lazikian station, confirmed the responsible administrative factor of the Fox News station.
This responsible factor did not specifically say what was the goal, but he said he was at least one.
The printing agency Press states that the target was the SA-125 rackets of Russian production.
At least two times a year ago, Israel made an aircraft attack on the delivery of a cancer in Syria.
Many things moved, and it's different.
Maybe the commenter Pečinka said so that it could be agreed where the president of Schéch reflected the disaster.
Heytman Chovanec was understood to me just as they chose him to the presidential, and confirmed it.
The Chairman of the Sabbath was, and he is the symbol of the CSSD divorce still.
The other gentlemen's mainly predicted their weaknesses.
Senator Servicebier is essential and unusable, and the president of Zaorálek was most disappointed by television discussions.
As a result, I don't see a better chance than the CSSD to be the presidential president of the Gaydòsk Senate, the only one would not have a beginning Hendikep, and I think it would lead to a standard performance.
It's so good that someone's supporting him.
I add that this solution is the only option to forget what was done and to continue without breaking the page.
Alena Gaydòsk could without doubt be established by a minor government with only blessing from the President of Baby and without humans, but with the human health minister of Hovorka, who is actually a social democracy.
This minimum government should have a great stability because it would pursue the right reference law and thus commit to support the President of the Court of Justice of Okamura.
The President Babiš would finally take care of the tax progress, because he's a big and will see that it's not going without her.
People wouldn't have problems because Hovorka is the best wearer of what they have, and they would not be otherwise in the government.
The same applies to the United Nations, and there would be a valuable minister, but if they do not want to enter into the risking government, but a sustainable support, it is also well.
Let's get the courage of Alena Gaidovski!
Initiative work with visum authorisation may be subject to the 'autority' test
As the Government intends to expand the police steps, it considers the "autority" test for the work of the work with vision authorisation 457.
The test, if it is accepted, shall apply to the criteria for preventing the application of 457 to fill non-working positions, or as a backward for the movement of the family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, the former lawyer Maxine McKew judged the Governing Repository on the jobs with the words that it could hurt Australian neighbors.
‘Classified declaration of ‘continents at the end of the front’ and ‘work first for Australia’ are a very inappropriate residence from the time when the unions requested a protected market work,’ she said today for the Australia-Indian Institute.
History means that the white force work should be protected – and I would not be surprised if anyone in this region mentioned this historical artefact.
The debate article addresses 12 measures which the former Prime Minister of Chris Bowen considered earlier.
Ministry of Employment Brendan O'Connor, who was last on Mr Lance, where officers for the feeding of people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the final rest of the call.
The criteria of "autority" shall be adopted, and the applicants may be detailed to be examined whether "the nomination is authorised when the candidate is in relation or in personal connection with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking".
After the previous experiences of businesses intended to sponsor the small number of workers, but then hundreds of employed, the company may also require to delay the number of holders in vision 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Mr. Lanka, who tried to azyl, died with a doubt of an infarct after this week arrived on azyl ship on the Christmas Islands.
The nine - year - old man’s fearful son traveled with him to Australia, and after his father’s death in the middle, he was comforted by an adult brother who was also on the ship.
The Australian offices and the husband moved to the hospital on the Christmas Islands where he died.
The British Government has announced a study that aims to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high quality services for Scotland and North England will start until the first phase will be started in 2026.
The Ministry of Transport of Baron Kramer said that the project “sounds the Great Britain income”.
The Scotch Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was a partnership with the British Government on this plan.
The stage will be made from a new high-quality influenza line between London and West Midlands.
After the end of the Phase, two will lead a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the Government reviewed the estimated costs for the building of high quality lines between London and North England from 32.7 billion GBP to 42.6 billion GBP.
The British Government, which conducted conversations with the national transport office of Transport Scotland, confirmed HS2 to enhance further railability and the possibility of enhanced travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that better proposes British and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the benefit that will bring is great.
Without this, we're going to face the crisis in our railway ability.
However, it is also related to the connection – in addition to the Great Britain, the HS2 will be better connected to 18 cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The Spanish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “The present announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
For the Scotch Government Keith Brown, Mr. Carmichael, invited him to support the Scotch access to the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-quality trace has the potential of bringing Scotland indirect economic advantages, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the total case of high-quality railway over the United Kingdom."
We therefore cooperate with the British Government to examine the possibility of bringing high-quality railway to Scotland, thus bringing all benefits and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which is the Scotch government as it plans.
I am pleased to review the report of this study together with the British Ministry during the next year and to a joint decision on other steps.
With Barta, she arrested inspections and anti-coruption police analysis
The information about the arrest of the Wita Barty has started to broadcast on Thursday evening when you brought a message server Prpr.Reads.cz.
MF DNA's interests proved to take care of the General Security Inspector (GIBS), its people had to catch the Board in the Centre of Prague.
It was played before the Four Seasons hotel.
The inspection resolves the cases in which the police are accused, however, its authority is related to civilians.
According to MF DNES, the arrested and one of the counterparts of anti-coruption police is the leader of the analysis and the information of Jan Petrželek.
He worked in the past for the Security Information Service.
The speaking anti-coruption police Jaroslav Ibehei refused to comment with the evidence that media must be turned right to GIBS in this matter.
Even her speaker inspection, Rada Sandor, but she didn't want to say anything, she returned to the Civil State Representative in Prague.
"This question we will not comment on the protection of the emphasises," said the speaker's representative of Stepanka Zenklova.
In addition, this increasing reaction can be discovered that the event has been played, but it is in a regime of disturbance that does not allow the speakers to say anything specific.
In similarity, Bart's lawyer is also the Oldrich Chudoba advocate.
The media said that the Board represents "and in this thing", but because it's related to the accommodated information, Bart's arrest cannot be confirmed or released.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest could be associated with some police president Peter Lessym.
It was called to the Bart right, together with the former President of the VV Council John, who was sitting in the head of the Ministry.
The spor that was burned between Peter's expressor sometimes and VV had to even resolve the president Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship has been taken to my person.
Nobody contacted me, I wasn't listening.
"I really don't know anything about things," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the police leader.
Officially, even though the Council John, the real boss of the side, he was Bart at that time.
The Board now candidated to the election for the motion of Usvit, the missionary mandate was only quickly avoided - about 175 votes.
The leader of the University of Tomio Okamura announced that he doesn't know what it is.
"Barta was one of the many candidates on our candidate and as I repeatedly said before elections, it wasn't even a member of the Wisvic Direct Democracy Tommy Okamury," he distanced from the Okamura Bart, who said before elections he gave Bart Camp to candidate for Uswitt because he helped him to resolve the problem of executors.
Witness Bart felt at the court in 2012 with his former partner with VV Jaroslav Scharka.
The rules for the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft shall remain in Australia at the time of entry into force
Traveling Australian aircraft companies will still need to shut up their tablets and smart phones during the starting and attachment, and without prejudice to the changes in the United States for the measurement of the rules on these equipment.
The American federal aircraft administration (FAA) gave to the American company Space to change their procedures, so travelers will be able to read electronic books, monitor videos or play games during the critical phases of the flight if equipment remain in the "flight" mode.
The travelers can do this during the excessive part of the year, but many people are deceived that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the start and accession.
The Australian carriers will examine this decision, which requires a great job from the American carriers to comply with the requests, but indicated that they are not planned to change their procedures soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also stated that this notice was examined, but stressed that the restrictions relating to the use of electronic equipment in critical stages of the aircraft were still in force in Australia.
“CASA has no specific provisions for the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft currently,” he said.
This question is covered by the rules required by the aircraft operators to ensure that security will be maintained for a long time and that passengers act in accordance with the safety guidelines obtained by the members of the staff.
The Virgin community, which already spoke to CASA about the extension of the use of its wifi whisper-display system, was changed, but notified that the regulatory authority's decision would be detailed.
"Happy → If the CASA authority has performed an analysis of authorisation to use electronic equipment, because we really believe that it would be now that we have (increasing palub divertance) has improved the performance of the clients," said the speaker.
The Qantas community notified that it would keep the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment should not be used during the development and accession, and we do not intend to change it quickly," he said.
The FAA provisions are related to the American aircraft company.
But we are still interested in the development in the regulatory, which can be useful for our travellers, and we certainly simplify the decisions of FAA and d·y which are behind him.
In the case of airporters from the United States, the impact of the rules will be distinguished by the company and will depend on their old airport park.
The operators will have to advise that their aircrafts can tolerate mobile phone breakdowns, and to review manuals, school materials, manual facilities programmes and traveling information.
“When a flying company confirms the tolerants of their floots, it may allow the travelers to use transmission and easily electronic equipment such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones, in any oversea height,” the FAA said.
In rare cases, the low visibility of the seat orders the travelers to disable during the arrival of the equipment.
The group also recommended that a difficult equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the overhead of the head.
With the growth of the middle class, the floor in Singapore is blown.
In the buy center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops the golden box, rings and snippets so that she can pay her daughters to school.
"We and our husband just bought a house and gave all my money to it," Ms. Amirthaling says.
Although each month as a administrator gets $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the monthly income is not enough, he says.
The request in the South East Asia – where the household debt is increased – is in fact that ValueMax, where a woman conducts its transaction, has become a third place in the Singapore.
The stop of spikes is not just a way to pay awareness – 1300 SGD in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is also so leaving as an unsecured bank.
Contributors in Singapore are currently applied to an annual percentage of 17 per cent, a total of 15,4 percent of the rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a rent in the same purchase centre.
However, the staff have the benefit that they do not require a person's (payment history) verification or income document, and may provide a payment more than the banks.
And thus, by feeling that the family feels the pressure for the increased life costs and the increased debt of homelife and debt, millions of people around the region turn to the debt.
After five years of potential growth from global financial crisis and supported money policy, family with low and medium receipt turns back to stakeholders in order to arrange disturbing financial operations.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency was sensitive to increase the use of credit in households, especially because of increased payments as a risk factor for the creditability of the Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt of household in Asia.
Malaysia is at the head of the rubber with 80 per cent of the BDP, which is the growth of 60 per cent in 2008.
The economy also feared the high level of the debt in Thailand, which was just so from the technical recess this week.
On Thursday, it showed continuing weak exports and weak demands of consumer.
"It is essential that the increased costs of people from the middle to the low [presidents] will try to complete their receipt wherever they will be able," said Song Seng Wun, the economy in Malaysia's CIMB.
The historical high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to that people willingly stop their own property and use the opportunity to change their family shoes for the preparation.
Approximately 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 citizens are made of gold.
People say, the price of gold looks good, we'll stop the grandmother of gold and get it from the next month.
The largest operator stopped in Thailand, EasyMoney, menal in recent months up to 20 percent increase in the number of clients uses its staff.
The growth in the stationary sector is so large that ValueMax, the operator of the bathroom in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to the neighboring Malaysia – where he has four bathrooms – but, outside Asia, says the Executive Director ValueMax Yes Lee Ching.
It will be financed by 60 per cent of 66 million SGD, which has been won in the Singapore Burge this week.
While some disconted believers have experienced criticisms for high rates, Mrs. Yes says that the debt offers not only lower amounts than the final believers, but also does not increase the debt directly.
“The clients stop the subjects already owned, and the money of the personal property does not increase the debt of household,” he says.
In the company, the holding of the property is still more accepted as an asset to ensure a short, safe financing.
In addition, among those who use guardians, they are not just people in financial pressure.
The rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax bathroom when they stop gold or hours of Rolex, and they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in preparation.
Our clients are from all possible circumstances.
"They belong to the rich individuals who are shortly paying for their courageous business or investment, or small enterprises that help to solve problems in their money course," Mrs. Yaova said.
Sometimes it's just getting money that I don't want.
Reserve package in value 325 million dollars for the Tasmanian health
The Federal Government requires that a safe packaging of $325 million for the associated health in Tasmania contains strong submines that will ensure that the State government does not distort financially.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is acting “in a measure” to repeal the crisis of the older population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Financing for four years has been decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian lawyer Andrew Wilk.
"The Government has come with a narrow salvation package, which, as we believe, will resolve specific problems with which it is," Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The 325 million dollar package contains 31 million dollars for the patient's request.
Other 2600 operations, including orthodetic operations and seal operations, will help to remove obligation.
Finances are also available in Hobart and Launceston, better reoperation care, education of health specialists, mental health services and personal electronic systems of health records in local diseases.
"This investment reacts to the thoughts of the primary clinical doctors told me that they would help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," Mrs. Plibersek said.
The Ministry noted that the Tasmanian government needs to require a close statement and evidence obligation.
The State will have to maintain the current level of financing in order to receive the money of the Australian Union and to inform monthly where additional financial rates were charged.
It will be established a trial committee that ensures that the State provides services as effective as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that 325 million dollars are in nothing, “to follow the real reform by the position of the sustainable foundation of the Tasmanian public health system”.
However, he praised the Government for his reaction to his request for a granted assistance that he first raised in negotiation with the President of the Government on the beginning of May.
"I believe that the federal assistant package will be able to release public health from critical status," said Mr Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional procedures selected shall be expressly rejected by recent greenhouse.
The speaking federal opposition in the health of Peter Dutton will say that today's statement is only "payment".
"D: Why I am here, it is that the Government has exempted 430 million dollars from our health system," he said for ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes at least half billion dollars, and the Australian Union which is $300 million, and looks like it's a good news.
Mr. Dutton called Mrs. Pliberseck to ensure that no dollar from the backup package was issued to the higher bureaucracy.

Syria destroyed her cups for the production of chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munices with food gas, said on Thursday, the Committee for Global Chemical Monitoring, while there were conflicts in the north of the country, and it was nearly one of the places where the food substance was stored under the conditions.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also declared that since the beginning of the civil war, more than 120,000 people were killed for three years ago.
The notice of the Organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons came before 1 November,
the term that this organisation with Side in Haag established to Damascus for the destruction or delay of the operation of all equipment for the production of chemical weapons and machinery equipment for the mixing of chemical substances by creating food gas and carrying out munices.
The completion of this in principle of the beginning phase of destruction is a significant ambitional time-related ambitional rate that claims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damask until the half 2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria is able to produce a new chemical weapons.
However, the lady must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and resources.
It is estimated that this country has approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemical substances and weapons of yperite and nervous gas of sarine.
The announcement came on the moment when the fights were shot in Safira on Thursday, about which experts talked as a seat of chemical weapons and insurance, the Syrian observer for human rights with the seat in Britain.
The group of activists, which monitored the total number of victims through the Syria network, reported on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
That must be 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the Government side, there will be 29 954 members of the armed force of Bashara Asada, 18 678 military battles and 187 army from the Libyan Hizballáh.
There must also be 2 202 government overseers and approximately 5 375 opposition fights, of which many are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations believed that since March 2011, 100 000 people died in conflict.
This number has not been updated since that time.
The conflict offered about 2 million people to leave the country.
Asad's units were fighting in Safire against the rebels, from which many are connected to Al-Kaido, all weeks.
The observer reported on Thursday that the loss was on both sides, but she had no specific numbers.
The wars are threatened by the inspectors of chemical weapons, who are at their mission when they have the continued civil war of Syria to deliver the chemical arsenal, have to arrange with close terms.
In the statement of the OPCW Authority, which closely cooperates with the United Nations, it was said that his team is now “comfortable that he has verified – and followed the destruction – the Syrian primary equipment for production and mixture/completion”.
He added that “no other control activities are currently planned.”
The inspectors said that they had completed the first trip of checking work when they visited 21 of the 23 places held in Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of security care, they were not able to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW Authority noted that these two places were “from Syria and ... the items of the chemical weapons that contained were moved into two other places checked”.
It was not instantly known whether the equipment in Safire was one of the places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria agreed on the plan of complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW.
"I swear by the devotion and the ability you have shown in the fulfilment of this most advanced mission as this organization had," said the director of the observators Ahmet Uzumcu in his comment by the OPCW Authority.
Now, in its third year, they stand against themselves in the citizen war, especially the Muslim Republics of Sunnith and Asadov, with their security forces, which are full of members of the Sect of Alavites, alongside the shit Islam.
In addition to further development, the Chef of Observatory Ramí Abdul Rahman said that in the middle of the middle of a strong explosion in the aircraft in the Syrian circle of Lazikia.
He said the cause of explosion was not known.
Wrath over the judgment of the founder of the bomb attack on Bali
Moreover and family 202 persons killed in a bomb attack on Bali in 2002 reacted fully to the sentence of the last of the founders who were set before justice, and said that Umar Patek had to be corrected.
The past that was running about 10 years to flee as one of the most seeking persons in Southeast Asia was judged yesterday to 20 years of procedure for building an explosive equipment that was used in the bomb attack.
In 15 years, it could be released subsequently.
This 45-year-old man was searched for a guilty of murder at the attack of two night clubs in the annual tourism of Kuta, after which 202 people were dead, including 88 Australians, and many hurtful.
It was also considered victory in some other points of deterioration related to terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on the bones in Indonesia for the Western evening of 2000.
The accusation requested experience, although she could endure that a man with the overseer "Demolition man" (bourner) through his expert's story on the production of explosions would have a death penalty.
This decision resumed the painful injury of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost his 39-year-old Jane and Jenny at the destruction of Patek and other founders.
With the laughs in the eyes she said Patec should be judged to death.
I really think he'd have to go in the tracks of those finals.
For the AAP agent Corteen, Mrs. Corteen said, "They should be set before the reader."
Every day I have to live with that I don't see any other neighbors and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when it was 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 hours from the outside of the parking supplier.
Peter Hughes was in the Pa’s bar, where only 20 seconds before the self-mortal attainer burned baths filled with explosions.
In the course of the explosion, he fell into the comma for months, and while he was maintained in life, three times he was “dead”.
Mr. Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same judgment as three final members of the terrorist cells Jama Islamic responsible for the massacre – Amrosi, Muchlase and Imama Samudr – who were corrected four years ago.
This guy should get the dead crime as no one.
Keep him alive... no d'you, why to keep him alive, it's just not.
To get 20 years because he killed 202 people and killed hundreds of others, it's not so much.
The past stood before the court as the last of the atentators on Bali.
The arrest was avoided almost ten years, but finally in January 2011, in Pakistan, Abbottabad, where the former leader Al-Kaïda Usam bin Ladina killed about four months later.
During the Court of Justice, the FBI agent in his testimony announced that the reports of reporting services found that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Ladin in trying to reconnect between terrorist groups from South East Asia and Al-Kaido.
"He was not voluntary," Mrs. Corteen said.
He didn't feel sorry for how much he had caused to be disappointed to others.
The Verdict comes before the 10th annual attack that will start this year and to which they will belong to the ceremony of Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of lz," Mrs. Corteen said.
It can be revoked to the court yet.
FAA: Travelers now can use aircraft costs (but they can not call from their mobile phones)
The passengers of the aircraft will be able to use their electronic equipment “from the door to the door” – except calling from their mobile phones – to read, play her, monitoring films and listening music based on the new rules which the Federal Air Management issued on Thursday.
Traveling but they don't expect changes to happen immediately.
As the change will be made, according to individual aircraft companies, the FAA manager Michael Huert said to print.
The aircraft companies will have to add to the FAA management how many their aircrafts comply with the new rules and that they have updated the school manuals for the halls and the equipment storage Directives to be in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA noted that it had already received plans from some aircraft companies to expand the use of transmission electronic equipment in the aircraft.
Among companies that have already been transferred are Delta and JetBlue.
“On the basis of this plan we can improve the extensive use of electronic equipment very much Âe”, FAA said in our declaration.
At present, travelers are required to disable their smart phones, tablets and other equipment when the door is closed.
They cannot be enabled until the airport reaches the height of 3 km and does not give the authorisation.
The travelers expect that their vehicles will turn off again when the flight slows up, and they will not shut them up until the flight is on the ground.
In accordance with the new rules, aircraft companies whose aircrafts are rightly protected against electronic movement may allow their passengers to use their vehicles during the aircraft, airport and coming, introduced the FAA.
From the number of new transport aircrafts and other aircrafts that were modified so that travelers could use Wifi at the higher sea height, it is expected to comply with these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Studios, welcomed the changes.
"When new rules will be made safe – and we will cooperate with the transport companies – it will be successful," said Glading in its declaration.
Honestly, we are already saying that we look like “guardians. ”
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and sms or downloading data will continue under 3 km oversea height, said the Agency.
The traveler will be informed that their smart phones, tablets and other equipment will be changed into the aircraft.
So there is still no Words with friends, online game type scrabble that played herc Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011 when he was, as well known, exhausted from the American Airlines Airlines airport, because he refused to disable his equipment when the airplane was parked at the door.
And more hard equipment like notebooks will have to be stored for fear that they could hurt someone if they were flying after the cabine.
Mobile phone talks will continue to be banned on the cart.
The rules for mobile phone use are not the FAA, but the American Federal Committee for Telecommunications.
FAA may cancel the prohibition in some electronic devices during the emission and accession.
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the State Security Committee on Transport, the National Safety Professor at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can create movements with navigation devices, but from the FCC data we also know that they can cause in the air the movement of the shifts," Rosenker said.
The Working Board Committee, established by the FAA administration, has proposed the last month to allow the Government to increase the use of electronic equipment.
The FAA has been developed in recent years to reduce their use limits.
Criticals, such as Senator McCacilva, Democracy from Missouri, claim that there is no legal security debt for this prohibition.
Limits are also more difficult, since use of such equipment is all of them.
Some studies indicate that when the third of the travelers is able to disable their machines or ignore it.
The FAA started to limit the use of electronic equipment traveling in 1966 in the reaction to the movement of navigation and communication equipment when travelers started to carry with FM.
New aircraft companies are much more shown on electric systems than aircrafts of previous generations, but are also built, and are approved by the FAA administration to be remote towards electronic movement.
Aeroplane companies have offered a traveling Wi-Fi in traveling overseas.
The plans governed for Wi-Fi systems are also more relaxed to disturbance.
The majority of aircraft companies should, in the light of the new rules, affect the use of electronic equipment, said Huert.
Current electronic equipment generally result in much less intensity than in the previous generations.
For example, the electronic reading issues: when returning the page only minimal sending.
But sending is stronger when equipment download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those who press to release the restrictions to use these traveling equipment.
In 2011, the representatives of this company installed the transport aircraft to their electronic readers Kindle and carried out the experimental years, but no problem occurred.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee have expressed mixed feelings regarding whether these equipment represent a risk.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of passengers of the aircraft companies said it was convinced that the breaking of these equipment is fair, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have declared that there are only adequate reports from pilots that have to support the fact that such aircrafts can cause distortion of aircraft systems, and the number of these reports is very old.
However, the Board recommended that the FAA pilots allow the passengers to disabled machines during the aircraft for low visibility.
The Road Promotion Group welcomed these changes, and it seems that it is a reasonable procedure for the traveling public that uses much.
"We are happy that the FAA felt that a pleasant road is not in conjunction with security," said Roger Dow, the Executive Director of America's Travel and Association.
The bird was transported flying from the garden of the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the border after it was found out on the floor border in the Black Sea, and was released back to free nature.
One cross was transferred to Aberdeen last month after the Scotch company had treated her in a salvation center until he was healed.
Colin Seddon's carrier said, "This crowd probably migrated from North Europe when he took a strong wind over the North Sea."
According to all, he got power and he found an attachment on the floor.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was not able to fly again, so we were contacted with the request for help."
At the time he was kissed, he was in a good condition and an old.
Is the European Elite prepared for trade with British?
The campaign Business for Britain (British trade) has been launched in April with the promising to connect undertakings and to define what changes in relation to the EU are going to see the British undertakers and the establishing work of the site.
We have made the largest and most complex research that we have asked for their opinions about the British, trade and the EU.
YouGov asked 1 000 leaders of British business representatives of the most different sizes and of different sectors and regions.
The results of research will be for many surprises.
We have secured that the sustainable majority of companies are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernize and grow while the EU's States stand up.
They want to see how the Government predicts new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil than to prevent the long and increasing process of reform of secret European institutions.
When we questioned their opinions on specific policies, from monopol regulations after production law, most of the enterprises expressed the view that the control of these key skills should be returned to Westminster.
The general incompatibleness with the single market and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels Regulations are now overcome of the benefits of being part of the European Trade — even 40 per cent of large enterprises, so traditionally the most pro-European company.
Finally, our investigation of business leaders has discovered the most exciting knowledge, and although the uniqueness wants the British enforcement of the change and relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not political.
The finding with which different sizes and main business groups have been complained shows that the business sector is pressing on the "sensitive change" that will bring the impact of the consumption into the United Kingdom.
It is so much — the achievement of changes with → and the better agreements for British can mean up to 16 % when voting in the EU Reference for Conservation.
The President of the Government should not weigh: this investigation shows that the British trade supports its plan of renewal of the British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects that this newization will mean a significant movement from the current development of force back to British direction.
The better agreement for British is possible and because the euro is on the road for an external economic and fiscal Union, even more needed.

John Kerry admitted: Sphere has gone too far!
The United States have been spending sometimes "too far", allowed by the AFP agency, John Kerry's American diplomatic leader during the video between Washington and London.
But, according to the Minister, the collection of information served to reject terrorist attacks.
"The recognition of Washington" according to the AFP included the areas on both Atlantic Marchs due to scandal discovery of the American National Safety Agency (NSA), which also became American associations.
"In some cases, I recognize, as the President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have passed too far and we are sure that it will be in the future," said Kerry.
But in the discussion, he was mainly adequate practice.
The collection of information is necessary for combating terrorism and forbidding attitudes, such as attacks from 11 September 2001 in the United States, attitudes in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
"We prohibited the aircraft to fall, the buildings exploded and people were killed because we were able to be informed on the basis on time," Kery said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone unexpectedly far."

Alexei Miller from Gazprom's company says he's starting a new gas era in Bulgaria
The start of the South Stream gas building in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom.
"We are witnesses today: the building of the Bulgarian part of South Stream gas, the largest and most important project in Europe," President Alexei Miller said in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream's need should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
The contrary between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which bring Russian gas into Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says officials.
Miller says that the direct connection to Bulgaria, Member of the European Union, means that geopolitic risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.
Once the whole project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream gas for a significant price.
The Gazprom community says that the building in other countries is to begin at the end of this year.
Plynovod is proposed for an annual capacity of 2,2 billion to land gas stops.
Hizballah sent thousands of battles to Syria.
Waiting is a decided battle.
Lebanon's movement of Hizballah has distributed 15,000 of its battles north of Damask in preparation for a decision-making battle on Hornata` Kalamun.
According to the recent reports of Israel, at the middle of two places in Western Syria, he destroyed the cancers of Hizballah.
This libanese shit organization fights in Syria on the side of dark armies.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which does not move in the Syrian conflict, but said that the distortion of the movement of arms to the hands of Hizballah to Lebanon.
The reports on the Mediterranean Israelites on arms funds in Western Syria are immediately addressed.
Israel's attack was nominated, but the American resources confirmed him.
For the Syrian website Dampress.com, the rackets issued from the Mediterranean Syrian Racket Base Snubar Jabla south of Latvia.
The reporting station Al-Arabia states that two funds were acquired in which the cancers were prepared for transport to Libanon.
For her resources, Russian production cancer was SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but the military analysis Ron Ben Jishai said that Syria is continually trying to resource Hizballáh with rackets and the Syrian airport teaches members of the armed section of Hizballáh with rackets.
SA-8 are the old rackets that the Syrian Army has since the 80s.
They're located on a moveable transport.
Although they are relatively receiving, the mobility and small dimensions may be easy to hide.
They're equipped by a radar, which will be disabled after the shooting, so it's hard to put it out.
Latakia is located in Western Syria, inhabited by Governing Alavites.
It's a well-conserved and Hizballah has been shared in wars in West Syria in the past.
It states that it helps to protect the Syrian shit community to which the alavits belong.
Now 15,000 of his battles are probably ready to help get back the army of Kalamun.
Along with Hizballah, the Syrian army also strengthens its units.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of the country of Homos.
The battle must be led by the sources of Al-Arabia for a recent attack of opposition to the domination of the Syrian shit brigade and Fadla Abbase in the Damask shiet.
Hizballáh helped Syrian Army years to return to the city of Kusajr at the Libyan border.
Many resurrected ones from Kusaira went just to Kalamune.

The Queen Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Juvenile Association (YMCA) were accused before complaints against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission for Sexual Injury of Children was found that before a consequence was raised against Jonathan Lord of Caringbah, two employees of the Christian Juvenile Association (YMCA) in the New South Wales were accused of sexual disorder of children.
However, before the Commission, it was noted that in their introductional statement for the Commission, this association indicated that they never resolved the case of sexual disorder of the child in their organization.
The Executive Director of Phillip Hare was asked for the case when one of the employees of the YMCA association was accused of crimes relating to children's pornography, and another when the bodybuilding in Caringbah from the YMCA association was judged in 1991 for sexual accusation of children who were concerned.
Mr. Hare said to Gaili Furness, adviser of the Commission that he had said about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the introductory declaration of the YMCA association was also unexpected when it noticed that the YMCA organisation had conducted external audits that have evaluated this organization as the primary staff of children's rights.
The evidence presented to the Commission is that the YMCA organization was warned that in the Ministry of School and Company audit of August this year, the second of the four possible evaluations was received.
Mr. Hare, who started working with YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the leadership of his own direction failed when Mr. Lord accepted, without providing whether the staff is obligation to announce the violation of the child's safety rules.
Before this year, Lord was judged for the sexual complaint of 12 boys who had been allowed during two years when he worked in the YMCA association.
He was arrested for at least six years.
Mr Hare, however, refused to say that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prohibited the staff to report the infants' security deterioration by Mr Lord.
Members gave evidence that they were witnesses of such pollution, including that Lord was with children alone, especially watching them, allowing them to sit on the line, told them that he was myself, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was the Lord's undertaken and asked for the development of children's security because she was concerned about her behavior, realized that Jaccu Barnat, leader of children in the YMCA association in the city of Caringbah, was “very scared and often hard to talk to him about something”.
The Director-General said that it was not accepting evidence of the personal that they felt not knowing if they should contact their overcome and effects.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord was darkened by their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the Council of the YMCA association in New South Wales reported its opinion that the teachings from Jonathan Lord's case for the organization for the staff were “no news” and the Council agreed with it.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign the peaceful agreement shortly after the accusation occurred, the general manager for children's services in the YMCA Liam Whitley organization.
He said that the goal was to avoid disruption of evidence, but it was "deeply fierce" and wrongly performed.
Professor Stephen’allbone from the University of Griffitho said to the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not safe in 2009 to 2011.
He said that there were serious problems in the setting, testing, working, training and management of the staff.
The hearing was revoked to the 20th.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return to the post of the Ministerial President, but he admitted that the return was impossible.

While in Cardiff, the experts were able to fight the price of the Coin of the year, all were able to believe that the competition was easier.
But no one was ready for the three-year Fenton Kircland.
Although he doesn't go to school and just a few months ago he made the first pieces, this boy and his animal boy, the Shetland Point Toffee, the colds were closing three wheels to finally get the primary price and leave 30 beaches with adults.
This unexpected two - with the same height - was on the annual competition operated by Sunnybank in the village of Rudry near Cardiff for view, behaviour and age.
He standed against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant clothes, he put his bar in a happy angle and let his two-year Toffee change after the surrounding.
Fenton was grateful for his natural ability to control the horse, which is far above his cup.
And Toffee got the highest signs for view and personality.
Fenton Toffee got to his third birthday in March, and since that time with this shetland ponic daily.
His mother Donna (30) said, "Fenton and Toffee are greatly cooperating."
They didn't make them big, but finally they left with the golden cow and kitchen.
It was just the way he concurred with Toffe, and when he wined, we were an overwhelming.
Everyone thought he was a phenomenal and totally stranger people wanted to photograph with him.
The boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is in his tea Sharon Howells, who leads horses over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere, and everyone encouraged and tried."
He fled through the sand throughout the whole length of the aréna and, despite he did so little, he gave a great effect.
Fenton is a seeded animal – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has been concerned with two bathrooms.
In view of how he started, he'll be on the roof of the year and I'm sure he's gonna do good.
The speaker's annual concurrence of the horse leader said, "Fenton's only three, but he knows how to control the ponik."
It's a great team together.
The prosecutors brought Fentona and Toffee out for their excellent evidence and the way they were carried out in the competitive area.
They always watch how good the team work between the ponik and the leader – and Fenton and Toffe were the best at the bathroom.
I'm sure Fenton's helped too a pretty clothes, he really fell with him.

After he was arrested, his newspapers issued on the title page two requests for his release and claimed that they were worth his journal work.
But then, Mr. Chen appeared in the state TV and admitted that he had given false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused a damage to Zoomlion and to the whole media industry and his ability to get public confidence," he said at the CCTV State reporting station.
I've done it primarily because I've kept money and glory.
I realize I did wrong.
After Mr. Chena's excuses, he issued a letter of New Express on the title page of the excuse, where he indicated that he failed when he did not perform sufficient control of his messages.

The British police gave Assange an announcement of the issue
Today, the British police reported an announcement to the founder of WikiLeaks to Julian Assange, who found an attachment to the equadoral welfare in London, where he requested asylum.
Scotland Yard announced that, for the 40-year-old Australian, he had given a "notification of issue" by requesting him to get to the police station and that if he does not, he could threaten his arrest.
Assange in the British Law issued its options when the High Court rejected his revocation against issues this month, and so the release to Sweden for accusation of sexual crimes.
Because he feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, the 19th June was looking for an appeal on the Ecuador Equatorial Divinity in London, where this Southamerican country requested asylum.

In the course of the tax on the owners of the occupational potential, Londry bublin
The Ministry of Finance has preliminaryly calculated the tax from the expenditure of the financial property, but expects the final decision of Mr Osborna, which, in the 2012 budget, represented a payment of 7 % for the transfer of buildings in the price of over 2 million billion billion billion billion and annual taxes for buyers who have their own abilities in relation to the company, never as individuals.

Scientists have more lightened how ocasus movements relate to the hair dog
Earlier research showed that happiness dogs turn ocasus more transport (in the sight of the dog), while nervous dogs are overwhelmingly left.
However, the final dogs are now saying that these great differences in the movement of ocasu menat and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist of the University at Trent, said: “In people, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain has a different link to the substances that excite positive or negative emotions.”
We've tried to look at the same thing in other kinds.
He added that the right side of the brain is responsible for the left moves and the otherwise, and that these two hemisphers play a different role in emotions.
In trying to get further information about how dogs react to the indirect ocasing of other dogs, researchers monitored animals watching films about other dogs.
They measured the heat frequency of these animals and analysed their behavior.
Of course it's going to be before we realize why their ox goes sometimes on the one side, and on the other side.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have told dogs films about dogs – either in natural version or in silutes – and we have released any maturity and we have also able to modify the ocasus movement and show it more right or left.”
When the animals saw an unexpected dog move by the ocasus of the right (which looks at the dog's turning ocasus), she remained absolutely in silence.
However, when she mentioned the ocasy to the extent to the left (recommended from the dog of rotating ocas), their heat frequency increased and the animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigar said he didn't think that the dogs would communicate each other with these moves.
Instead, it thinks that dogs have learned from experience on which moves they have to be and who don't need to take care of.
He said: "When you ever met dogs and their ocasus moves in one direction, you will respond on the basis of this experience."
Scientists say that discovery can help dogs, veterinarians and customers better understand their animal emotions.
John Bradshaw, a high school farmer at the University of Bristol, said that it wasn't the first study that examined whether the left and right side is important for dogs.
Last year, the team from the University of Lincoln has made sure that dogs turn their head to the left when they watch the aggressive dog, and when it comes to a happy dog.
And in another professional negotiation from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “I write with a robot, dogs with more probabilities were listed at the time when he wrapped the ocas left than the transport, when they were more uncertain – exactly forgetting the Italian study."
The Chapter may be given according to that dogs in these different animal studies in films or dogs of robots were not completely closed as dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to dogs.
“Although in many different ships, there are lack of evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different areas, many details are still needed to explain – and dogs are not exceptional, ” he said.
But because of how easy it is to mention their behavior, obviously it takes time before we realize why their ox goes sometimes on one side and on another.

Pape František named the first cardinal in November
On Thursday, Vatican announced that Pape Frantiszek 22 February first named new Catholic Cardinales.
Cardinal owners in the spirituality of the Catholic Church are the highest position immediately after the paper and are those who choose the paper, so Francesk will establish his first group of men who will finally help to choose his representatives.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
However, when the cardinal reaches 80 years, the group can be reduced to 120 choices of cardinaals.
In the announcement of this report, Patrico Federico Lombardi, speaker Vatican, said that before the celebration of new cardinaals, the conservation of current cardinals will be made known as a concistory.
"Papa Frantiszek decided to communicate his decision to call the unor concist before to facilitate the planning of the final destructions that require a number of cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices letter said that the number of electing cardinals will probably fall into February.
He said that the dad usually names so many cardinals as it is necessary to increase the number of electors again to 120, and so many cardinals that exceed 80 years as he wants.
The next year will be significant because he will be the first time he was chosen in March this year, Valero said.
At this point, a certain orientation is shown to Europe and in particular Italy.
"It would be interesting to see whether the new father nominates the cardinales from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only an intimate number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since the time that František has established the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinaals from the whole world, which has been given for the purpose of finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything for himself.
"Now Frantiszek has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it is “deeply possible” that these cardinals ask for advice.
But we haven't been in this case before – it's a complete news.
Valero said that papa's traditional exciting bishops from large places, but František is “a full surprise — so we don't know who he is called. ”

I had both calls twice – shared in my change
It says that Obam's sincere efforts have distorted the obstruction of the Republican Party
Instruction policy cannot excuse the suffering of Obam's website Health care or aircraft attacks
Obam's memories of the campaign of 2008 are strong in the case of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris studies medical in Harvard for another year.
In these days, I'm reading a library very quiet.
I thought this book would encourage me and rebuild me in the day of my second year in the medical college.
It is named "The Audacity to Win" (Victory Traffic) and it is an advice to the presidential Barack Obama campaign in 2008.
When I finish patients and I go to bed tonight, the book returns me to the time that politics inspired millions of people and shows that you were breathing.
The elections have been completed with a drive overwhelming, and the television reports needed us to think over the history value of this moment.
My companions wept joyfully, and my parents hid the news that they found.
In the White House, a young team of victories was ready to change.
During the introduction to the Authority in 2008, Obama had 82 per cent support.
And I'll close the book here.
To go to the present, it's hard to wake up, as to get out of sleep.
It is difficult to take these optimistic days – they seem to be remotely remote, silent in the dismissed opportunity.
In years after I put my first election letter, changed.
It wasn't absolutely anything I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and multiplying successes – from the law of accessible care through the release of our armies from Iraq and the end of the policy “no question, nothing to say” after the death of Usami bin Ladina.
Moreover, I am convinced that the parties have rejected so many efforts to move our people before: among other things, it is immigration reform, the public's opportunity to choose health care and the closed bases in Guantánum.
But after many times, when I defended Obam's administration before colleagues and friends, I grew up to an absolute limit.
I felt in a political place without a chance.
The obstructions of the Republicans cannot explain an agreement with the audience of the leaders of the officers or with the injury of the aircraft that kill innocent children in the ocean.
They cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the United States' privacy, nor that it follows those who dismiss wrong government negotiations.
They cannot be responsible for the correction of Anwara al-Awlakí, the American citizen, without legal court or for the limitation of public contributions and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
They cannot be justified to find a message, which says that the efforts of the White House to shut down media are "neagressiver ... than Nixons administration".
And the latest or the latest may not be able to create an unable to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the available care of simple web pages.
I don't know if something like that could be waiting.
Did I have been supposed for 18 years that the government power could be in conflict with the political campaigns they had before.
The volunteer has obviously no predictable progress, and our public conversations will create opposition political parties and advanced events, such as the massacre in Newton.
However, all of the examples I have introduced above seem to be the result of my own administrative decision.
And that's the most pain of me.
I called both again in 2012, but not because I was excited from his candidate.
Mitt Romney represented a artificial and unexpected alternative, and it seemed that he couldn't implement his policy or position.
I felt that the second time for Obam, released from the pressure of the next elections, would be filled with the second period that we ever heard about.
However, the return to 2008 – as Obama's support has fallen under 45 % in this week – is more difficult in this book.
I'm going to take a lot of promises that have been lost.
This week, I read the Old of the book about how Obama suffered a long distress with Clinton in Pennsylvania at Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his chief that he had to get to the template and remain aware of his sending.
"I want our bottle," he said.
We're not able to handle who we are.
It's been five years, Mr President, and I'm totally agreeing with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are exclusively the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer states that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in the center of interests for the programme of family authorised
The billioner and lawyer Clive Palmer say that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in the center of interests for the programme of the family, because his daughters can be disturbed and hard from it.
The banish magnate, which leads to a dispute for the replacement of the tax dimension of coal of 6 million dollars, has made this claim when he tried to meet the table the question whether it is in the middle of interests.
Palmer’s United Party may control up to four voices in the senate, which are a key role in decisioning whether it is eligible for taxes from carbon and weight activities.
But Mr Palmer stated that in the center of interest only ministers could be, and added that Abbott's daughters were in the position where they could have a personal benefit from the policy.
"He got into a large center of interests regarding the payment of a parental license, because if any of his daughters were disturbed, he would have a direct interest in whether she would receive a parental allowance," said Mr Palmer.
Two months after the elections of the elections of the electoral Commission, Mr Palmer officially announced for the winning of the Fairfax chair in Sunshine Coast, thanks to 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer invited to review election results for the process.
Tony's daughter Abbotta Frances and Bridget.
Should these options decide for two months after closing election rooms?
"We have to have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, get the details to the computer, vote immediately and have outcomes in half the seventh evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of a claim to indicate voting letters.
Is it that the results can be broken if they don't like someone?
In those days and at this time, the use of a claim is unbelievable.
The electoral Commission studied the options of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme is also related to the aircraft in Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new job "very serious".
The public office is the public service.
"We are not seeking any recompense except that we can serve the company at this critical time," he said.
Do you have your hands?
The scientists were coming to buy your hands, and you're throwing down.
Experience was involved in 98 persons divided into three groups.
The two had to resolve an unresolvable role.
Of course, both did not.
But a group who was thrown up his hands after the accident did much more optimistic than the one where her hands were not missing.
In the next test, the group with the hands was better than the other.
Yet, those who laughed their hands were worse in other tests than those who didn't have them.
The results of the "supported" were at the level of the third group which the leaders did not register any successful failure.
The test results indicate, according to psychologists, that the body cleanness removes negative feelings after failure.
In addition, however, the motivation is lost, the tests need to be concentrated in other tests.
When they brought the results of research in Czech, the most optimistic were after returning from the WC.
After using the WC, only one percent of the Czech and the Czech Republic has the hands, but on the road of city transport, it is five.
On hygiene, it is also after work in the garden or in a long time when 85 percent of people have hands.
The 78.7 percent of people are motivated to move their hands.
The recent investigation discovered that there is a division in the view of the Czech and Slovaks, how important it is to put hands on the hands of a stranger.
In this case, 28.8 percent of the Czech and 40.3 per cent of Slovaks are in the hands.
The investigation showed that both nations mix their hands ten times a day.
"Although it would be at the place, I fear that the reality is different and people are trying to do so little better," commented the results of the study of the skin doctor Klaudie Komárk.
RBS suspends two trade operators with a foreign currency
According to two notified persons, the Scotch Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two trade operators in its division with a foreign exchange, which is another indication that the global investigation of the control authorities relating to suspicious currency machines is still more frequent.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities in the world's largest financial market investigations, where each day 5.3 billion USD has changed.
The references to two operators would be suspended by the first RBS employees in the context of an extension of an investigation that is responsible to a scandal with the LIBOR-manipulation rate (Lundian interbank/rate rates).
The Bank refused to comment the suspension, but confirmed that this month he received the information request from the authorities.
"Our unexpected investigation in this matter continues, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other authorities," the bank declared two weeks ago.
Last month, people who have near this event have noticed that the RBS has submitted to the British financial conduct authority the records of e-mails and their reports sent from the earlier businessman.
This businessman, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and assumed that he was released from his current position of European trade president with a foreign exchange in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Preparation Finance Chairman in Citi, was suspended by the Standard Chartered company this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former chief of the currency trade in Barclays and UBS.
Not one of these businessmen has been accused of any crime.
The group of Mr. Usher for sending messages belonged to banks from Barclays and Citigroup, who told people to dedicate this event.
The Bank UBS said this week that after the Swiss Control Authority notified that it investigated suspicious machinery on the market with a foreign change in some Switzerland banks, it had effect on steps against some of its employees.
Worldwide at least six of the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopolal Authority Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong, examines the statement that these banks have been encouraging to move with the monetary market.
In addition, the notices were stated that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse received the request for information from the competent authorities.
The Banks are ready for years by old reports and emails to find cases of criminal crimes.
Reports on investigations have been disturbed by operators in a rubber, which was one of the largest engines for the creation of profits in investment banks in the past years, but which was cancelled by limiting small monetary insufficiency to speculates.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the competition when they claimed that, with a large and high liquid market with a foreign currency, it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but the higher position of businessmen say that it must not be true.
The highly established business officer said that despite a significant volume of daily trade with a foreign exchange of liquidity tests between different trade platforms and banks which increase their own internal platforms, “You can begin to have the effect on the market at the very low prices.”
The report came on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she lost its trade department, which caused a loss of approximately 6 million USD at the end of the past year.
The Bank immediately warned the competent authorities and cooperated with their control authorities.
"We are convinced that this businessman acted himself and that this problem was resolved," said Credit Suisse.
The beginning of HIV in Prague passed a thousand
Physicians in Prague have been studied more than thousands of people with HIV virus.
From the beginning of the investigation in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of the year, the tests confirmed the order for 1005 persons from the metropole.
This results from a national reference laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
It seems that in the entire CR, 2 063 were injured.
In 396 the disease of immunity failure has already occurred.
198 people died.
The beginning of the insects in Czech in the last decade is growing annually.
In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, about five years later they had been 12
In 2009, the investigation discovered 156 new sentences and then in 2010 180.
The preliminary degree decreased to 153, but it was recordable.
According to the laboratory, they were 212.
"On the fact that the total number of new-related cases will overcome 200 years, I think it's no doubt," is a minor expert on the AIDS Miroslav Hlavati problem, which has led the Prague House of Light for patients a year.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, the tests were discovered in 39 people and last year at 47, introduced the Hlavati.
In September, 21 new patients and three patients were studied.
HIV tests have been confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women from the beginning of the investigation to the end of September.
AIDS illness was in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Whoever wants to know the town, he's supposed to go on the graves.
His visit is more than a traveller with memories, bones and galeries, more than he would produce a bedeker.
Many people are reading from the graves.
They're quickly disturbing the seeds and get intimate view of local reality.
They discover what people live here, which nations, which are the faiths, in which large and coherent families belong to, where they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professionals were for them.
In what way they express their community positions, their whispers.
And from the state of the graves, it will also prove how they will remain for their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obam’s health care law
The High Court in the United States decided that the health care law signed by Barack Obamou is in accordance with the establishment, which is the fundamental victory of Obam's administration.
With regard to vote 5:4 the Court decided that the individual Law Regulation on the protection of patients and available care – which provides for citizens to buy health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatening them to pay payment – does not respond to the establishment based on the Governing Tax Authority.
The President of the court John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining part of the legislation of 2700 pages and further decided that the legal request for health care that allows the States to extend the possibility of obtaining a disease insurance, in the contrary, threatening the financing of all disease financing from the federal resources, is not a donation and in contrast with the establishment.
The claim for the blocking of this law was granted to 26 States and the National Federation of independent enterprises.
During the premium in 2012, each of the major Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitta Romney, rejected the law.
For the words "Mugabe is a bowl egg" the court has cancelled the law.
The Zimbabweans had to give a good attention to the public talking about the ninety-eighty-year Mugabe, who rules the country since the beginning of the 80s, then from the end of 1987, stands in her head.
In accordance with paragraph 33 of the penalty law, the Chairman's Board's renouncement of 100 dollars to one year of freedom.
"The State representatives should not heedfully accuse people who comment on the President in economics or other public places," reported the representatives of the Court of Justice.
Nine judges agreed unilaterally to subscribe the law to the freedom of expression.
It is probably likely that the Government has revoked the British BBC against the decision of the Court.
In contrast with the law, a number of damaged Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, whose police arrested the president for two years ago at the police officer in bar.
In May, the opposition activist was completed in the processing of Mugabe's public service with the "cooling egg".
In August, then, the prosecutor accused a sixty-year-old man for his purpose to use a toilet paper with Robert Mugabe face.
The Court also announced the anti-dumping law limiting the freedom of media.
"State cannot treat people whose declaration will be shown as an injustice," said the Minister for Justice of Luke Malal.
As long as the Zimbabwe law now enabled the person who publishs false information to be sentenced to twenty years of prison.
"The existence of a law that allows criminalizing someone for an uncertain declaration has a disturbing person to express himself freely," added Malala.
Despite Mugabe governed the country with the hands of over 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a reference to a new statement with larger citizen freedoms in March.
In 2009, the driving rounds from the dictature of a man of the country reached the agreement between Mugabem and Opposition to Morgan Tsvangira's primary chair.
However, the earth continues to suffer economic crisis and the highest inflation in the world until 2008, which exceeded 100 000 per cent.
Therefore, in 2009, the government rejected the national currency.
Today, in Zimbabwe, only the currencies of other States are applied.
The proposed economy is on Mugabe's increasing agricultural reform.
In 2000, he divided the ground of white farmers between his hosts and war veterinarians.
However, most of them did not have any experience with the walk.
The central banks will maintain the swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Feder, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a continuous tool that allows banks to access global currency whenever necessary.
The banks have introduced it in their joint declaration.
"It's a very reasonable step," he recommended the decision Julian Callow, the main international economy of the London Bank of Barclays.
"Thus all transitional tools of this type have become permanent, so it is not according to my surprise," adds the leaders of Bend, the main BH Securities economy.
The central banks are forced to enhance the claim that began to occur in 2007 when the international credit market was first lost.
The agreements of central banks have enabled access to euros, dollars and other changes to anyone who needed them.
The decision of Central Bankers comes at the time when the American Fed is prepared for the end of its programme of support for the American Economic Aid, which could eliminate the price of money on the global market even above.
The swap contract shall be used by default to convince the lack of liquidity of one currency in the current residence of liquidity of the second currency.
It can be captured as an input of one currency and a second currency expenditure.
The ECB starts the third trial to return trust to the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on bank monitoring, the ECB will monitor 150 banks.
As Tipsport (not) can be personal data.
More than a year ago, I've performed a registration on the Tipsport.cz pages.
But I didn't finish here afterwards, because there was someone who couldn't finish the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another bathroom, the registration fell, then I moved, and it changed my address and number of civil displays.
When I wanted to finish the registration, it was told me that it wasn't, because I have another OP number, address, and that it just doesn't be done and that I'm going to ask for the output of data and perform a new registration.
So I did this, and I wrote on technical support 24.10.2013 that I requested to remove all my personal data from the database according to the valid legal law for the protection of personal data.
A spiritual day has written me a technical support that I've got the registration to finish the bathroom.
This started the e-mail maraton for technical support, where, finally, after the fourth urgency 25.10, they wrote that personal data on my request were deleted.
So the man would say that he could carry out that new registration and the problems started here again, first, it wrote to me that my name has already been set up (the understanding was not deleted - not about personal data, but finally it was arranged).
So I used a different name and shot on me that my personal data have already been stored to complete the registration on the bathroom (as they could have been stored something that they claimed to be removed?), so I contacted the technical support again.
To my question, how can it be said to me that personal data was deleted 25.10, and to send a mail with that mistake.
I did this (only 15 hours ago) and they described it today that I was registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that it would not be because I used the same name and birth date.
What I've been contacting the technical support for a week, and I'm saying that it's not going to be.
And what about the fact that if it was true (as not) it could not be registered with the corresponding name or the same birth date if it was already registered.
Only outside those 13.22 I registered myself, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the thought e-mail and phone number and the world wondered, the page showed me that they sent me a link to the e-mail for the finalisation of the registration.
But how is it possible if it cannot be registered on the same name and date of birth?
It is also because Tipsport appreciates the registration of e-mail and the phone number and data just did not create as stated.
So I reported this technic support again that they're just lying (be intellectual, or they don't know what he writes), because what he writes is not true.
I added a few of the fact that the registration problem was already before 31.10, so "false" registration does not have any effect on this.
I'm sorry, but because you're already registered, we can't check your statement.
And the communication ended.
Respectives repeat the same as the registration is deemed to be name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and, in fact, it didn't.
So I'm going to shrink, Tipsport, not only that he has not signed the data as stated, but still lies when he's thrown.
It's worse that it can be easier to prove how they lie and try to look like a mistake is on the side of the client.
In addition, after this matter was introduced on my personal blog, things were moved a little, and from Technical Support, the email arrived that the matter was forwarded to testing and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and survey and warning of the same error).
A music plays in a metro on the Pool
The transport undertaking hl. m. (DPP) Prague started the music project in a meter.
By the vestibule, where the metro is playing once playing a reproduced instrumental music, the placement of line A is on the outcome of the Vaclav area.
The test operation takes six months.
Michal Horáček represented his new double album, capel and three songs
The texter Michal Horáček brought to the Colin's City City City Hall not only his new twoCD Czech calendar, but mainly in the order between us the Lenka New, Frantic Segrada and Ondra Rumla offered by the outstanding Orchestrem Mateja Benka.
After the introduction of the intru and the herotic study of the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three songs to the podium, himself came to the light in his hand and remembered the story of the last playing in the Colin and in the divadle and in the whole city.
"It's just two kinds of cards in the Colonel with which I've been coming into the cup," he said.
He also remembered the father of the President Zeman.
"Perhaps they could make tours after the Zakolan or the Dubravce at Bratislava," he wondered about the parents of other presidents.
Sometimes in the evening, Horaček, who didn't leave the wheel, and if he didn't speak, sitting at the chair with the wine, touched his new musical destruction.
The calendar also made Joseph Manes, who gave her on the air, about the yellow hoke, but that time he didn't know how we were going on these places and scandaling who didn't shoot, it's not the Czech.
So one song from the Czech calendar is also named, but we don't play here today," he wins.
Ondra Ruml, however, sing out of this board for a lot of suitable sleep on the day, sing after night and moved to her on a kytar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percuses, and all three songs, and he made a cap in the lock of the keyboard, violoncello, kytar and contrabase.
All three vocalists together sing a bit of a trailer to the side of the heart, who straightened the view.
"I am that that the song has taken you, which didn't surprise me in the town of Kmoch," Michal Horaček answered.
Following Petra Hapku, I recognize Franziska Segrada, originally from Richard M.E.R.M.R.A.A., Hanu Heger remembered again the track of Dad had the Lidu Baraar and the Horack Explanation on the Communist Prohibition and Replacement of the Baar American heritage of Mae West.
According to Michael Kocába, Sebastián’s song again, Segrado sang the beautiful track of Praha, the deceased Garden of Liberty, the amazing parent and the former Collinjak.
But it was already a conclusion, a stick in stage and an additive in the form of optimistic tracks We live in a beautiful time.
The playlist was ready another additive, but the fans didn't get out.
Just immediately after the concert, the fourth seated for a table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček, even the board from the Legendary LP and with the eventual interesters, photographed.
Berdycha is completed by Rosol and Hajek
At the final of Davis' degree against Serbia, he nominated an unusual player of the Czech tenists Jaroslav returned to the fourth Tomás Berdych, Radek Sztépánek, Luka Rosol, Jan Hajek.
The Czech representatives of the trofey are covering, but they are playing on the woods to the white-ground aren, where the backscape is on the strong surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the final, the Czech Republic is the third in the last five years.
"We know we're going on the heavy ground that it'll be wild and we have to focus on our performance."
"We'll go there with the only goal - get three points and sell it best," said the Stepán, a victory of a victory point in the lower final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
School for Obam, how to bomb Syria.
American command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Yellow.
The Israelites exactly predicted how the Syria bombing would look.
Without an extreme humb, threat, and millions of announcements sent aircrafts, you put the goal and returned.
Without allowing the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
The whole action refuses to confirm and do not explain it anymore.
Exactly deteriorated and greatly lost, did not support Obam's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying at all the attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media be dismissed by their statements that it was bombarded "Syric Base" or "submissions for Hizbalah".
Recently, I wrote this about that while the United States secondary resurrected ones in the country only remain on a restaurant area, so Russia's joyfully adds Syria's weapons.
And just a fresh delivery of Russian cancers in Latvia became a lot of Israel's nail.
Clear message.
And note, Israel bombed Asa's regime again, no resurrected, although it should be according to annual Internet theories.
The American Government appointed two members of space units, probably Delta force.
It was not yet known that they were signed during the attack on the American Consulat in Bengasia.
It is known to the herds death of two former SEALs members who took the area in the town, I think it was the members of the secret command, which was created by former soldiers.
Long was speculated what SEALs did on a consulat or even in a different placed resident.
Now it's clearer.
Any information that it has its officers protected by culometrs in Libya (only on one of these, both SEALs have lost after the minometh) is extremely surprising.
But more surprising are the information about the two unknown herds yet.
They were parts of the United States Command in Tripolis, and when they received a report on the attack in Bengasia, they voluntaryly joined the demand and, together with five private contractors, they broadcasted the road to the region of Bengasia.
The ambassador claims that during that attack, the command was not officially and completely established and that it just wasn't going to do.
The commander, so without orders, will probably release these volunteers.
Everyone does not act in the country uniquely, but the permanent American commands, agents and private contractors are all interesting information.
This is because it has not been officially accepted until recently, and it is now only talking about some of the NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States are trying half to strike the terrorism in Libya.
Although the national solution would like to help much more.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write today is the surrounding of Iran.
It hasn't been so long as the media have soon spent Iranian air forces for the shopping of American drones.
However, it is little known to the Americans protect their drone.
Of course, if the accident is able to discover his drone in the airspace, there is nothing to do with it.
However, the Iranian drone is discovered in the international space, and it is totally different.
So the Iranian airport F-4 Phantom tracked the American drone in the International Sea Country, when it was possible to the first amazing of the American super-scale F-22 Raptor in the history.
He made Phantoma clear to verify his arms, without recording it on the radar or just noting it, and then when he immediately opened up inside and calling the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without repeating.
It's not wondering when Phantom is an American production airport, which, however, remembers the war in Vietnam.
It can't be compared to Raptor.
We want to show that the Plz still can win, promises Rajtoral
It's a little paradox.
While his team is especially examining in the last time, the defense or the founder of Viktorie Plzeň Frantiszek Rajtoral has a form that has brought him back to representation after year.
He's also shooting shooters, a guy of activity, after the end of the loop of the loop in the Tepliningen, a cockpit was designed.
Victoria shot in the last two rounds against Slovenia and Tepliningen after winning, but finally, the only point was taken from these two dulls.
Francisco Rajtoral says his team in the fighting with Jablon will break an inappropriate series.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we're gonna hurt the Jablonec home," he promises Frantiszek Rajtoral.
Many are quietly prepared for a hard deal with the North Chess who play an attackbal.
Everything goes to get with the Jablon, the trainer makes us well prepare, as we can do much of the video solution of games support.
"I believe that it's gonna be a good story on Friday evening," the Czechian representative of the fanotics at the Doosan Arena tribute.
The latest ships haven't gone like she wanted, but the word of the defense crisis of Viktoria refuses.
So it goes in the battle, sometimes you have a good form and sometimes worse again.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis anyway.
"I believe we're winning on Friday and it's going to be good again," the Mine of the Western Rounds.
Viktoria's husband will go back to the support of fans.
"He's playing on Friday evening, and I'd like to call our fans who are beautiful."
"I believe we'll give them thanks," adds Rajtoral.
Jana Petti: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think so, it's not really a step, but a big shock - a shock for a few years of age, and it's in the spring, to my childhood.
It's an appeal to what it was, doesn't have any concern and just come out of school and spend the ships, relax and make jobs.
Although these "obligations," it was just the theory, the desire of parents.
The practice was totally different - to come out of school, to run the cock and run out.
Play with the last kids of a boy game, shoot a panna.
Then, at Helen's series, and her boy's increasing the same festival brush for a grandmother to birth.
And then, after some warning, finally lay down the vessel, relax in the winter, wearing the tree into the stones and the tasks of doing to the lamp under the lamp (or to join the council and instead of the tasks to write the loving verse addressed by the school lover).
Tomorrow to feed the household of a marmellade (from a real fruit, not those jackets that are sold now, with which the contents of the ice and not lies) and to drink it with the tea of the sucked bilines that we and Mother have gathered together.
I'm also taking a look at the funny evening when the funeral was quiet in the room when we played a song with my sister in the boxes that were voidly shot in the old box after my mother.
And then we moved the boxes on the other side, and we still left up the same song, our favorite song, and they joined it with a siphon.
Or we phoned through the table using a song that was connected to it - and when we had already been at that phone to hear us better, it was necessary to clean ears, then the holiday was a sick + vata.
The minimum wheat was more than three times lower than now, and my parents could live so we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of these iPhony, iPady to even mobile and notebooks or label clothes.
The clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "profit" in the garment was bathiced house-production trick using SAVA.
From the electronics, we have been satisfied by the mother mentioned as a cousin, and mostly as Walkman, about whom we shared with our sister and which we used for the other time just in the battle of school.
We've been more interested in playing with Tante Hop or Man, not hurt, or how I've already brought out "only" out.
When I was a little elder, we got under the video player trees, we certainly watched our parents, but desirablely he didn't play with us.
My younger sister's kissed the shot, so beautifully covered the cazets, so she tried to sleep and shoot.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last place.
Well, and this arrival's still in this morning, poor, on a talent from my dad.
She says that when Lenka was small, she shot the shot into the video and she thought she was playing her reception and didn't win, so she couldn't get it up to this day.
I mean, how we all able to communicate together, to agree without a mobile, computer.
Jointly with my sister, we agreed with my grandmother's grandmother's neighbor when we meet again in the next year of the year with the grandmother, and so it was, that's what it paid.
We met.
Now you promise someone you'll see for a year?
I'm also taking the winter when we and the whole village run out, building snows, walking on a snow-coat at the bones on the snows on the snows.
Then we met together with the whole family and talked about the next days.
Of course, we heard the sister before every dinner, the nottoric's known: "Let your hands be cut!"
Yes, it's payable today, but you're sure you don't have a mixed mixed mixture in the net of citrons.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage was "working" at the beer with the Garden of the village, we slept with my mother on the ground, cut off the feet of the stone, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the woods of the stone.
We were near - truly - we didn't count how many friends we have on the social network, we imagined how many friends we have, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through different chats, SMSky.
There was nothing like that, but we've done much more about ourselves.
And so I could continue.
It's nice to take place, especially if I'll complete these spectacles by looking at the album where the black corners are relatively touched with black wheels called black white.
And if I didn't know how much I was at that time, the back of the picture is written in the year.
I see that even if our sisters had not listened to us according to the corner, and we had more than two brothers and sisters of two numbers, no one had ever done it before, it was so normal (never IN).
And I'm going to go back to the step in front, to the reality.
By 2013, I'll wait for what the modern time will invent one time for my children.
I'm sure this is that these my ambitions are now for a young adult generation so, at least some "100 years of opics" and I think they're not going to live for a lot of time, and I think they're going to say that they're not going to survive this "previous" time.
I would like it to them!
Google, Samsung and Huawei communities are complained for Nortel's patents
The group who owned thousands of Patents inquired by Nortel was charged on Thursday for the injury of patents against the manufacturers of mobile phones, namely the Google company, which was charged by Nortel's bankroot.
Consorcium Rockstar, who purchased Nortel's patents for 4.5 billion USD, caused the American Court of Justice in Texas by Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and other four patent infrastructure companies.
Rockstar company is in the common property of Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of the violation of seven patents.
Patents include Âi, which helps to connect the expressions searched on the Internet with the relevant advertising, indicates a complaint, which is the nuclear search company of Google.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately to stop.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that work on Google Android's operational system, which is strongly purchasing mobile products by Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google acted for the patents of Nortel's company, the default price offer of 900 million USD.
Google has increased his offer sometimes and finally offered up to 4.4 billion USDs.
Following the fight against Nortel's patents, Rockstar's companion had received Google for 12.5 billion USD Company Motorola Mobility, which was motivated by a part of Motorola patent group.
"By the failure in trying to get in the carrying of patents that are the subject of a disruption, the Google patents have violated and continued to be corrupted," it states in the complaint.
Rockstar's company seeks an increased replacement of damage from Google, because it believes that it is to deteriorate the patent from Google, as the claim states.
Miloslava Cejpk: Laptop smile
The sound came from 4 degrees of Celsia, which we're not going to be on them yet.
Earlier, she had a smile, what she had still given for a defense for the time of friendship.
That's what she's getting too excited because it was a mask that decided not to delay the public.
He was a real house only in the days of her grandfather and had her neighbor Elinka or Adika around herself.
And, of course, when the sons called her.
She was very well reminded of the lesson of the non-new business courses.
Now they've finally been right now.
That she doesn't hurt her nearest.
Then he was flying into the corner.
It's like a shit on a mask.
November, not another month can't do that miracle to smile the truth, as when they were on the flight with the one who hasn't been here almost three years.
Egypt shall enter into the office of the first freely selected president
Muhammad Mursí set up an inhuman swear, but his triumphal day is only a regular political concern in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursí promised “new Egypt” when he was celebrated to the authority as the first freely selected president of this country, after the Housch Mubarak, which was gathered for 16 months ago.
During its introduction to the Authority before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursí also became the first freely chosen islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of the state from the destruction of monarchie about 60 years ago.
He made a swear before 18 judges held in black campaigns in a seat built by the view of Nil, which is at the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are trying to make a better morning, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursí said at the celebration of the public TV.
"The Egyptian people today placed the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Mursí, a sixty-year engineer studyed in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brothership, a fundamentalist group, which was a 84-year-old group from its presentation as an illegal organization, as well as an unlawful attack of individual governments.
When Mursy arrived in a small column of cars soon after 11 hours, they kept the building of hundreds of soldiers and police officers.
Only a few hundred supporters had occurred before the construction court to celebrate the President, and, in the case of the Presidency of Mubárak, the transport was shortly stopped so that the column of the project could surround a straight road of the city's centre with the areas on the south.
The personal pressure of Mursí, directly mentioned as an uncharismmatic “reserve of pneumatics” of the Muslim Brothership, has grown from his victory and his pagan manifestation, which was intended to present him not only as islamist candidate, but also those who want to bring up to the end of the rebellion against the authoritative Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a citizen, national, institutional and modern State," said Mursí clothed in a blue community clothing with red cravate judges in the tree of the comer in which he made a swear.
Mursy was moved to the University of Kahir, where he had to introduce an instructive evidence.
During his attention, he received an official welcome from the military cappella, which had a national hymn.
The presence was the military leader of the field Marchal Husyn Tantaví.
His arrival was carried out by the scandal of “arms and people are one hand” of the mouth of hundreds of people who are conceived in the main prevention room of university.
The University in Kahire was founded in 1908 as a center of secondary education, and in the 70s, it became a battle of islamic student movements.
Mursy made a symbolic swear on the place of Tahrir, where a revolution was born, which was completed by the Mubárac authorities, and promised celebrationly that the presidential authority would again be captured by the military Council, which was taken from the released leader.
But I agree with the establishment of the Official Promises before the Court, more than before Parliament, as we usually, has been encouraging because of the military, which indicates that the fight for power will continue.
Mursy's show in the place of Tahrir was full of dramatic popular gests.
In the guettes, they'll be police specialists, may be increasing.
In the Ghetes in Czech, police specialists should be affected in the future.
They'd travel here until the half of their funeral.
They'd look at the orders and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge, they should contribute to the decreasing attitude between people from poor places and the inhabitants of the surroundings.
In his view to reducing safety risks, the Ministry will calculate inside.
According to the country's improvement would help "for the security of social residence".
The document was negotiated by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and quarters in Czech a few years ago.
It lived in them for 80,000 people, mainly Romans.
Adults in gates were without work, families were dependent on doses, children ended in "special" schools.
She's stuck.
According to experts of difficult locations, hundreds of people have arrived.
The rests between their inhabitants and the finals are exhausted.
Some places have been made of anti-rome trips.
The extremists also added people from the surroundings.
It's inside that the police's insurance in the guetty security and order.
The basic subminal is likely "the continuous application of equal access to rights."
But it doesn't appear to be able to achieve it without a detailed knowledge of the places and people.
The specialist would go to the travels in a ghette where he would travel up to half his service, the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd watch the order in the problem location.
He would also know local, so he could better resolve problems or crimes.
"Thanked trusts will easierly be able to take a number of anti-governmental negotiations," said inside.
Specialists in the gates would receive adjunctions, and it was 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police in the problems must be made from the Norwegian funds.
The start is about 600,000 euros (for now 15,5 million crowns).
Czechland pays 15% of the amount, 85% of the funds.
Preparations started for years, now we are processing detailed.
The project shall take place until 2016.
The authors were inspired in the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied to Slovenia for several years, where the problem with socially disrupted locations is inequality higher than in the CRC.
"There are such a Roman seat here," reported the authors.
How many specialists should be in Czechland, it's not yet.
The answer is to give an analysis that defines places where special police officers need.
It will also depend on the amount of money for these members after the end of the project.
According to the project, the police's elections are first to determine the stage in Slovenia.
Annually, this school should take five decades of members.
They'll be the most appropriate candidates.
It should also result in special education for policies who will act in ghetes.
According to the authors, the improvement would help social residence mainly.
It should be motivating and leading to integration.
According to the presentation of the inside, there should be three categories.
The minimum standard would comply with accurate rules, such as a number of persons to room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard should be social residences that would be comparable to running dwelling.
The applicants should comply with the integration plan that would be a social work with them.
They have to keep the resident order, care about their health, send children to school, re-reserve, and actively look for work.
If they were trying to start, they would have been in a higher standard of residence.
The system of transitional residence should operate inside at least 30 years until another generation grows "in a pro-in-the-motively motivated ≥".
Social residence models prepare resources for local development and work.
He's gonna have it until the end of the year.
Karel Drabek: Uglaire top - one of our youngest shops.
The U.S. top is an ideal cockpit of 3 km south-east from Bruntal.
Along with some other, the evidence of the security activity in the low Jessenek is recently (of geological view).
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of Thursday.
In view of the higher distance, there is a widely white wheel of the wheel church of Mrs. Marie Help, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
He's replaced the wooden woods.
The host who stood near the bone didn't keep it.
Soon after the end of the bone, it was thrown out of four rows of lip, a length of about 1 km.
The cross road on the top of Uglar is already a third version, the pomp here remained after 1916, the second, from 2001 only to 2004.
On fifty stops, there are wood plastics prepared by the local artist František Nedomlel.
He used different species of wood from the low Yeast.
Similarly, the foundation of the hornin from the present forms an interesting geological exposure.
The name of the sponsor is also listed in each stop.
The top of the carbon is the rest of the young shop.
Although the data from radiometric rates are somewhere older, the last eruption here was about 1,5 million years ago.
So he is younger than the Great Redny (every 3,3 million years old) and older than Venusian sopka (age 0.8 million years).
The man was born a explosion.
There has been a significant quantity of safe bowls together with the alomics of hornin from the grounds that were obtained by the exhibition by red-humid color.
At the end of this stage, the layer has gone to the top of the lave - today it is the layer of a perimeter of up to 13 meters.
The second eruption was red, red and places to black tufis.
Their layer is powerful to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the wall.
In the tufes, the ideal safe pumps are large to 1 meter. The second eruption was also used by the outcome of the lawn.
At the end of the activity from the soap, a layer that today creates up to 50 m the powerful level of the printing bowl.
The substances in which the evacuation of a safe coverage is the most common type of sugar.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they got the name of stratovulcans.
The PP's safe carrier was progressively understood by erosion.
However, he was threatened to the heat of the hornin in the south side.
The most intense weakness was here in 1953 - 1962.
The tufis were added to a beton, which then was easier and had better warmly isolated properties.
The exercise was under pressure of experts and publicity and thus maintained this unique place.
The problem, however, is in poority and small consciousness of hornin, which is the width of the wind, is spread and seated on the bottom of the bottom.
Lom's so relatively messed.
To be more complicated, it is a warm, south-oriented all ideal places for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but sometimes it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
On the top of Uglar, you will get after the green tourist mark from Bruntal, where appropriate from Slezský Kočov.
Automobilists can use an unpaid parking at the beginning of the lip al, where it starts a short scientific road.
She moved from the town to the panel.
Ivana grew up and enjoyed the largest part of life in the vile’s garden and basen in one of the most beautiful village quarters on Orechovce.
However, the owners of the house obtained her back in the refund, and the payers had to move with a small distance.
Ivan therefore looked for a replacement residence for himself and her older mother.
She received a tip of 3 + kk in the older panel home on the opposite side of Prague.
"For the first time it was a shock, but the watch from the fourth square to a broad lesopark and overground me on the other side," Ivan's appealing on the first.
I first said it would be a provision for three years.
"We live here today more than thirty years and not only because of a progressive restructuring," adds the owner.
The mother and her daughter were then moved from a 100-time apartment to a smaller board of 62 m2 and all the equipment were distributed.
The action was not simple, things were adjusted to friends and progressive income was nearly a year.
The new apartment was in general a good condition, but they had to continue the necessary changes, such as lacking doors or window exchanges.
The former owner built a kernel, but the owner's most often had a non-praktic solution and an extremely large front, and the small bathroom.
With two rooms, there was a multi-habitant room.
Architects used to mix separate zones and membership of sadrocarton rooms, which enabled new light places.
The principle to which she decided after a few years was to remove the points in the residence room.
Although this apartment has changed access to 2 + kk, the room has reached the air and has opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step to partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC bases for laminate.
Ivan's bathroom didn't know the advice.
For years, I rejected the magazines of living and looked for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting achievement.
So I celebrated the youth of Camel Douder.
"It was actually in the future the most important step," Ivan says.
Thanks to the shutdown of the bathroom, it was possible to be adjusted and available to the front.
The architect linked the WC room and the bottles and the two doors with open wheels, replaced by one movement that saved the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also enough free.
Quality boxes imitate a fisherman, and there is also a comfortable seat in the bidet rock.
Successful cooperation with Kamilo Douderar continued.
In the course of the series How the dream has passed, but the main change in the room, on which Martin Čeñek also shared.
We had to get three, eating, living, and spacing, without helping classic principles of optical division, such as half-grounds or Japanese walls.
"It would break the openness and the unit of the space in the output," explains the tech.
It was possible originally to separate spaces and residence parts.
It was enough to turn back two shoes and put between them a box made on a pearl.
The eating angle limits the weights of the grounds and the expenditures.
On the ground in the kitchen and the eating cut used the quality marmoleum, the moved door survived with a tape with a pattern.
The kitchen corner in the case of needs covers the top panels with the tape.
The new floor of antialergic marmolee has the preceding of the lamination of a variety of advantages: weighs the inclusive surface without sleep and better sound isolation.
The system of exceptions and previews from sadrocarton highlighted color is a show of how to work with room in the panel.
I left the colors on the graphics, I wanted it to be happy.
"I've got an airport, I had the same shadow in the previous apartment," Ivan says.
The circuit of the graphics with the motive of the floral magnologie is practical and creates a significant esthical element.
For the temperature of the energy tone, they chose a white, supported by the modern Property.
In the small apartment, books were stored outside the room under the window parapets.
Everything's on the lamps, the lamps are comfortablely controlled remotely.
In the translated interior, the new contrast works with the elders, such as the decades of the old Christian lustre and the quality of artistic subjects that Ivan collects the whole life.
The last time the kitchen came.
The boxes were previously placed on both sides, and the owner looked like in the tunnel.
The architect took their position and transferred their position.
The accommodation in a simple design is made for a prohibition, the white area has a quiet perlet surface.
In the small room, they were entered thanks to the ideaal solution of the puzzle, the sugar, and the bottle.
The view of a small kitchen survived the entire wall range over the work of the board.
The unique graphics with digitally printed motive is attractive, and it is also well maintained.
Ivana has chosen the flowers of magnologies that are at her favorite quarter in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here.
In the p's bathroom, there was a small van and a cockpit, and in the new owner, she chose a neutrale degree of the circumstance.
The big cow has a glassed door of Ronal.
The task was to create a simple space from a given ≥ age, in which the equipment and equipment will be harmonised.
We entered materially and colorfully together and tried for his elegant, attractive, not too overflowed view.
"The next subminal task was an unbarrierless solution with a minimum hinder and the possibilities of easily movement around the housing and the accessibility of the items of the daily need," adds Camla Douderer.
The Supreme Court decided: Sometimes it can be disappointed.
The High Court decided that the former Prime Minister Peter sometimes could be stumbled for the case of criminal acts that could be allowed before the August release of the Missoon's sniffle.
She protected him only a processing immunity relating to shows in Snow.
In the case of the former ODS Ivana Fuxi, Mark Snajdra and Peter Tluchore, however, decided that they could not be treated for the case of criminal acts until the loni were delivered to the missionary mandate in November, the speaker of the Supreme Court Peter Knöttig said.
The Court rejected this Decision by the State Representative of Iva Estvan, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the members.
They have adopted a payment in the form of lucrative posts in the State firms because they are granted a mandate and have made problems with the approval of laws.
On the contrary, the former premises that offered these posts can continue to be stumbled.
With Wit Bart, they also held an anti-coruption police officer.
Bart's council, Oldrzych Chudoba, who also represented it in the cup of a data corruption of VV missions, also did not want to explain too much, but said, "Yes, I represent the client in this case, but because of the protection of the emphasis I can't continue to comment."
According to the information Right Case will solve the General Security Inspection (GIBS).
The server noticed that the Bart could buy a broken information from the police.
According to the server of adjustment.ch, he could have been connected to the case of an ex-Chuss of the former police president of Petra Lessy, whose name to the Board was evidently supported.
The last information right but shows that the detention of the Witness Barty with Peter Lessy does not apply.
The Language Police Presidency Eva Kroč refused to comment on the case of the Prague City Representative.
"This question is that we will not comment on the protection of the emphasis," she said on Wednesday, the speaker of the State Representative of the State in the Prague of Sztepank Zenklov.
Just a dark complaint observes the matter of the Bart, and, therefore, its words directly indicate that the writing or criminal proceedings are conducted in the regime of destruction.
The reporter Novinek was able to hit the wife of Witness Barty Katherine Classnow before they lived in Prague Class.
She just put the cooks into the car and went away.
She refused to reject all the events.
On Friday afternoon, the Leader of Movies Tomio Okamura was held to the Bart's detention.
The one according to his words doesn't know what it's in the box.
"Barta was one of many candidates to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before elections, it wasn't even a member of the Wisvic direct democracy of Tommy Okamury," added.
Witness of the Bart, who in the next previous elections in Sněmovna in the Plzneiland, has failed to candidate for the movement Tomiah Okamury's direct democracy, is known to his corruption cousin of the public missions.
In April 2012, he was injuriously judged for 18 months with a derogation for 30 months.
Later the judgment was changed and the Bart was apologized.
Space: with NHL.
I've still got a wheel, a whistle, and a whistle.
Prosperala was a family in the first place, so she wants to be fully subjected to her in her 38 years.
Or he's getting a job in the sea, and he's still working on his career, or he's finally finished with a hoke.
"I want to fill my dad and wife's role."
"I'm very happy about it," says a hokeit, who still waits for a offer.
Though he's an announced worker who never will hurt anything.
Despite that he always leaves the heart on the ice, he can also strike the partners.
And too, despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Co.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still," he's determined.
Perhaps it's expected, it's evident about New York Rangers who haven't been invited to enter the season and also have two hurt - the attackers of Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
How does your arrival look to Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on the paper, it doesn't be worth it.
I know the article in the New York Post magazine that they should sign me, but that's all.
There was no longer added that that happened.
Unfortunately, I'd notice myself that I've got a fashion with myself, but it's just not.
They didn't even call you from the club?
Such communication in NHL is running daily.
That's what it's about to get into the ship when the spring is really coming.
When a player can't hurt or someone doesn't go and manchaft doesn't go.
There's a lot of different factors that have to go to the inheritance to get here with me.
But there's just similar circumstances in New York, right?
Rick Nash is hurt with Ryan Callahan and the team doesn't come into the season, so there's a certain chance, don't you think?
Of course, this is a chance.
The second thing, but it's that you're doing this two sides.
I would take a lot of offers today, but I didn't get anybody yet.
Unfortunately, it's reality in which I have to live.
On Friday, you're going to America, you're expecting that something could be able to screw?
I have the expectation from 5 July when the NHL opened the market with free players, and still nothing.
You want to go to New York to remember?
I'm sure that's not, I'm going to go to Tampy for children and for my wife.
I'm glad for the sun and when we're seeing me again.
Have you planned your program?
It's given by my father and wife, and it's all away from it.
I'm not a hokeit at the moment -- I don't have a hand and I'm not playing a refrigerator.
So I'm gonna fill my dad and wife's role, and I'm very happy about it.
You have two hoke storages on Sunday, that's for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our kids in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in the importers for full account?
Of course, a man can think about a lot of things.
This can happen too.
I tried it three years ago when I mixed 50 backs for the gentleman operation.
And too much and much of me.
Once it's going to be in a stage that all the winners, and the winners will not replace you with what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the sense of life.
Whatever you want to do.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could see outside the family.
You had a lot of proposals from Europe: Do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of the family you want to be in America?
Because I'm hokeist, so in the first place - except family - belongs to sports and successes.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And from that, the family life is declined.
My kids, then, forgiveness, our children -- my and my wives -- were growing in the United States, began to go to school and so far.
And we were terrible if they continued in this trend.
'Cause what we're going to do, there's the possibilities in America anywhere else.
That's the chance they should have offered them.
So you're planning to stay in America forever?
We'll practice it as now.
This means that we will be in Czechland in the Deepest and in the Czech Republic of Czech Republic.
And in the winter again in Tampha or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfectly ideal, being still warm.
I had a great happiness in life.
It's going to say that I went against him, it's been a lot of power and refusal, and it took me a lot of things I've missed.
But he's got a lot of options on the road, and this is one of them.
That we can choose with a wife where we're going to live.
There are people in the world who are trying to choose what they will do and how they will live.
How are you going to have in your chair because of the dress, the strength of training and waiting for a offer?
Yeah, that's the question I can't answer.
Today, I have it in myself, this cup, the desire, the niceness, your respect for this sport, this desire and motivation to prove people that you still have the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't say how it's going to stay there.
It's not gonna be planned.
So you're going to say you're waiting for this season, how it's going to go, and then you'll decide what's going on?
I'm at the stage when I'm coming from the day.
Recently, the Director-General of the EC noted that the decisions on the exhibition of 3 and 4 blocks of the Electronic Temelin shall be released at the end of 2014 or 2015.
It was expected by a new State Energy concept and a consent of contracts of the government.
The current leadership of the CHEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - so as a majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give the shareholders recommendations, not to hide.
Baby: I'm just ruled with the Sabbath.
Andrej Babiš begins to calm that his movement to the United Nations will have time to become a political range in the opposite and that he will have to be equal to the government so that it can come.
The President of the United Nations allowed it in a conversation for the right to go tomorrow.

CNN: Israel bombed the military foundation in Syria.
The target should be the Russian rackets for Hizballah.
The Israeli military airports, on Thursday, bombed the military foundation near the Syrian stand of Latvia.
The CNN TV has been reported with a call on the American Government's most mentioned factor.
The Israeli print of the explosion in the data storage reported widely, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
The speaking Israeli army on the CNN question refused to comment on the emergency information.
"We're not exposing to the media reports," she said.
The other Israeli attack was based on the American government resource of rackets and related equipment that could be transferred to the military libanese movement of Hizballah, according to the view of the Israelites.
The AP Agency, with a call for another American security factor, informed that the Russian SA-125 rackets were in the middle of Israel’s purpose for the Syrian territory.
The second channel of Israel’s TV informed that the aim of the attack was evidently highly modern Syrian anti-air defense system.
The satellite photos of the attack but, according to DPA agency, showed the Russian cancer battery of type S-125 New.
Furthermore, on them, the SA-3 cancer was seen in the main centre with a radar for monitoring the cancer and their targets.

Greenpeace activists held in Russia transported to Petrohrad
Ecological activists held from September in Russia for the protest against planned heat in Arctic was transferred from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
The AFP Agency has informed this today with a revocation to the Greenpeace International Ecological Organization.
It also states that the complaint of its pirate activists has not been downloaded yet.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic resources that thirty men and women, held in Russia after an unfair action against the landscape in Arctida, were transported from a corridor in Murmansk to a province of Petrohrad," announced the organization in the statement.
D’s movement of detained activists is not the; according to the DPA agency, planned movement.
Ecological authorities first committed pirateship, which threatened to 15 years of procedure in the case of judgment.
The last week, however, it was noted that this accusation would be replaced by a smaller extent that threatened the lower penalty with the above seven years of freedom.
Greenpeace, however, warned in today's statement that the commitment of the office's pirate has not yet reached as they promised.
This means that the detention is now accused of two crimes.
The powerful Committee for Research last week has noted that a pirately accusation would be replaced by a complaint of extent.
However, when the three-year-year-old members had stayed before the committee this week, the pirateship accusation was not downloaded.
Instead of this against everyone, a new accusation has been raised," AFP cited with Greenpeace statement.
The Russians held at Gazprom's landscape at half September three ten members of Greenpeace's movement from 18 countries.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship, which rained under the Netherlands flag.
Since that time, everyone has been held in the obligation, which they have given a revocation, but the court has rejected all.
Ecologists are on the submins.
The Executive Director Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to the AFP today, stated that the movement to Petrohrada was easy for the meetings held with families and consular works.
However, there are no guarantees that submines in the new procedure will be better than in Murmansk.
"You can be worse," he warned.
She asked for help by the Netherlands King Willema-Alexandra one of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen.
In a manually written letter that has published today the magazine Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called to talk about them at the planned meeting with the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It states that Maliki has a large share in the renewal of sectoral violence in Iraq, which is likely part of the part of wars in the neighborhood of Syria.
Schools should focus more on mate, spell and game
At the hours of the Ethiopian will need to simplify at least one Shakespear game, a new of the 19th century, a romantic poesy and a modern British beletry since 1914.
The test will also include “hidden text” in order to motivate the deepest reading;
Combined cubes of europa and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have maturity tests from the language, and they will be designed to choose English as an electoral subject.
The Ministry of School should issue new foundations for English and mate tomorrow – the first subjects that have radical changes.
The changes will be expected in the next year in the other main subjects.
In the single step of the office of Ofqual watching maturity tests, it reflects the changes in the structural tests, together with the new marking system and the less volume of projects for students.
In his presentation of Michael Gove, the Ministry of School, said that it was “a wide consensus regarding whether we would reform our test system, and we again received the company's confidence” and that it was necessary to take care of the maturity test to be“the more ambitionary, and more ambitionary”.
It shows that the Ethiopian schools are less time in matematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than the rest of the countries.
To compare school in Australia, mathematics are about 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although no official demand for more time matematics, the coalition resources have noticed that a comprehensive maturity test from mathematics – together with a more comparison to this subject in the exhibitors – will probably encourage schools to provide further education.
The educational plan will be more focused on “the problems of the real world”, including financial mate.
The island recipient Kajnar: Rakovino in ChSSD I'm not
Before the elections, it was completely disbursed between the two rats fighting the impact within the island CSSD.
Everything was rejected by the recipient of Ostravy Peter Kajnar returned to court because of the non-democratic building of candidates.
Yet, the cookers did not want to express too much to do the side before the elections.
Now, but the votes of the walkers have been counted.
The leading of the island CSSD immediately on Monday evening called the recipient of the Ocean to come out of the side, and it will obviously be pressed to get about his own.
Peter Kajnar wants to fight.
What's wrong and who's on his side, he described in a exclusive conversation for Denique.
How do you have the result of the choice?
The CSSD was probably calculated with a lot of better results.
Did she hurt us that they had been solved in the media of the middle of the side before elections?
I'll imagine that social democracy could have better election results.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the status in which the CSSD is now.
It's the side who has its internal problems, it's internally sick, and people realize that it's not all right.
In the choices, they gave it to be found.
What's the internal CSSD diseases?
I think I'm going through the ODS for a long time and, despite all, it's going to be played in social democracy.
It is that the lobbys, the vaults of people who expected to find their preventions at the ODS moved to people in the CSSD and had their influence on them.
Then it relates to that the police goes through the offices of the island magistrate and collects computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not only compatible with people who want good to all the ends, but many of them think of their good.
The CSSD is divided into two imperfect camps and in Prague, as well as in the current war of power between Haškovci and Sabbotkovci.
But it was already ready.
What happened before elections in East was just a preconceiving what's going on in Prague now.
Hasha’s wheel was gradually constrained by the position to be able to call at the elections that weaken the wheel of the Sabbath.
Humans are in the policy when sometimes need to be accessed to compromises.
But everyone has an internal border when those compromises are not able to do anymore, and that's my case.
I didn't want to candidate to the snippet, but when I took this whole thing inside the side, I agreed with Luboš Zaoralke that I'd try to get to the national candidate to strengthen the Ocean clay just.
Hask's glass to that, but it's got a stop.
Why should we stand on the side of Bohusla the Sabbath, not Michala Haska?
I think the Sabbath is a person who speaks primarily about the CSSD programme and in certain ways as well as visions for the side and for this country.
I recognize that I haven't heard anything like that on the other hand.
Michal Hashek's just fighting for much.
I don't understand how a president who is less authority than the Central Executive Committee can begin to call on the President of the Party.
It's a battle for a lot without regard to all, and I'm setting up the sides.
According to me, Michal Hashek has now done his political career in Prague.
How you realized that the island leadership of the CSSD did not accept you to the candidate.
Political parties are based on competition who will place as their members.
This competition should be based on programme views and the ability of those people to comply with these visions.
Of course, however, people who do not have much ability or vision are reported in this competition, but the political party is a challenge to money that would not be elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people are going to get to the front, because they violate the rules without disruption, they violate the statements of the parties.
They do their practices from the political sides of mafia, and I think they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
It is more important to me to note this problem than to take into account whether the Kynar has a political future.
It is important that the parties start respecting the statements.
Therefore, have you made a preliminary measures against the likeness of the CSSD candidate in Mo’Susles country before the elections?
The current periodic Executive Committee of the CSSD in the Iceland emphasizes its power by rejecting the organisations that do not make it possible to reject a new organization, which is gradually rejecting the inappropriate members of the party.
For example, they also wanted to throw Richard Bednarek out of the Club of Representatives, but he made a complaint against it, and then they rejected the resolution on his exhibition.
This shows that the maintenance of the statement of the party through the court is the last option, but at the time the final ways and control authorities inside the CSSD stopped functioning, it is the only option.
The leading of the island CSSD in the head of the lawyer Adam Rikala is to call you from the recipient position.
It's a public secret that this post has an accusation of the master of Poruby Lumir Palyz.
It's so, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyz are trying to do everything so they can call me.
They promise people the position, they get a voice, and then they keep their power on the side of those voices.
When I come back to the past, everything that might have been played around the Banik Ostrav Club and buying Bazaly stadium was just an intention to attack me.
It was artificially insinuated that they could mark me as a man who gives money where he doesn't.
Instead, the city bought a property, which has a great value for the strategic value.
So how do you see this continue with your detention in the recipient?
The Periodic Committee has already called me and other people on Monday, and they have considered their detention in the CSSD.
But I think it's like when evil cries: "Get evil!"
When we look at the outcomes of my work in the past 11 years, I don't see anyone in the island social democracy who would initiate and act, sometimes and against the members of the party, a result of so many development things, such as the need for industrial zones or the extension of the park.
Yet, I'm going to be inconvenient.
I'm not reading it else than I'm going to get the end to go to the place they want.
You're gonna try to fight against these?
Because if this Republic has to work well, political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any side will be able to be effectively guided if he can't drive himself.
So I don't think I'm going to leave the CSSD now, because I think the one who causes the cancer of this side is not me, but those people who try to hurt me.

The damage claims the EUFA to publish decision-making proceedings.
Dagmar Damk, President of the Commission of the Fotbal Association of the CR, stopped to publish the courts.

In the contrary case, the FACHR would have threatened the posts.
The Damk also refused that she would in her own side of the Ballasts Plzna from where she was.
These speculations are really insensitive.
It's true that I live in Plzni, but the final members of the Commission are all over there, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting, I can lose 1:6, "Damk said in a reaction to a critic, which was discouraged after what Plzeň lastly played two times so much penalty than the rest of the disease teams.

For a new citizen law, six fires from ten are prepared
The closeness of the new citizen law and trade corporation law from 1 January 2014 is intensely prepared by six four of the ten.
Only eight per cent of the questioned representatives in fire indicated that the matters associated with both key codes in their company were not solved.
It comes from the review of the advocate office of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which discovered the opinions of 108 Czech fires.
With regard to the close term of rationality of both key codes now, a number of managers starts to realize how they can have a significant impact on their company.
The biggest changes in the privacy in the last 50 years, therefore, as we consider, will be touched by all citizens and fires in the CRC.
For political laviation, the business sector lived in uncertainty if revolutionary changes ended or never.
"Now, however, they have only been left for a few weeks to walk to a new law for their company without complication," commented partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spachil.
From 61 per cent of the company intensely entered into the new laws, 26 per cent of their companies have already adopted all necessary measures to be prepared at time.
For more than 35 per cent of the company of this number, it is intended to take necessary measures at the closest time.
In contrast, every fifth company has not yet been involved with recodifications, but has a particular idea of how to prepare for them.
In total, 11 per cent has no opinion and the problem cannot be judged.
Only eight per cent of the company recognises that the issues related to recodifications have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal topic relating to the new citizen legislator is for the largest number of new contracting companies (21 per cent), follows the solution of trade submissions (16 per cent) and continues to change in a catastrophe of insolvency and in responsibilities for damage (10 per cent).
The contracts play one of the most important news of the whole recodification, which is the combination of the adjustment of the contracts only in the context of the new citizen law.
The current parallel adjustment in the citizen and trade law shall be avoided, in the result of which the contractual law should be more transparent for citizens and businessmen.
"In the case of businessmen, a new adjustment will offer a lot of news with a view to the more freedom of association," advocate Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Luka Submitted.
In relation to trade corporation law, it considers the most relevant to the subject of a quarter of the problem of increased responsibility of the statutary authorities.
Furthermore, the subjects relating to changes in the calling and crossing of valve hazards (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legal adjustment means the derogation of obligations and potential impacts to the statutory authorities, in particular in the case of the company or in the case of an accident.
"In practice it means that if members of the representative and fireholders act with the care of the right owner and do not reverse the threatening impact of the company, they can benefit from the benefits obtained for the performance until the last two years," added the Payment.

Travels through the water, the river and the jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages in Cameroun.
Bwelle and his team are almost every week of hundreds of patients
In Western Africa, there is not too many doctors in the countries; only one of the 5 000 people.
vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates at the price of CNN Hrdin 2013.
In concurrence on the price of CNN Hrdin in 2013, you can vote for or for any other ten of the main candidates.
He's getting $ 250,000 to continue in his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father again and again in an unconscious and led to a hospital that wasn't equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was hurt in 1981 near Camerun Yaounde.
Earlier he was treated only with a brown hand, but finally, infections developed in the brain, and there he created a hematoma that has affected the problems of his whole life.
"There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon," Georges Bwell says.
They had to take him out of Camerun when they had money for it.
Instead, Bwell was working for years by transporting his father to overflow clinics and hospitals where he received such treatment that was just available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can go out of the house in five, get to the hospital so that you may be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die only because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, it was not too changed.
According to World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5 000 people.
Only for comparison, the condition in the United States is one doctor to 413 people.
And even if the Camerun doctors could visit, many couldn't allow it.
Two of the five people in this country live under poverty and nearly three quarters of health care expenditure in this country are private.
"The only problem he has is poverty," says Bwell.
They can't enjoy life for poverty.
When Bwell saw his father and suffering many of his countries, he decided to do something with it.
Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteers team did last year free of 700 operations.
I became a doctor who was a chirurg in the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the ASCOVIME neighborhood organization, whose members visit for the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, its group of volunteers has helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are encouraging to supply, add to the ships of the medical needs and travel with a swimming territory to the villages that enjoy help.
No -- it's getting them happy.
Sometimes the vehicle must press through the river and the water.
But when it comes, they will be welcomed as a horseman: host, song, and dance, and the best apartment that the community can offer.
In these villages, medical care is free to celebrate and Bwelle, with its wide smile and unbreaked energy, is very voluntary to participate in local joy.
The next day the team starts to treat hundreds of patients.
"We've got 500 patients on each exhibition," Bwell says.
They're coming to the village from 60 miles [60 km], and it's the beds.
In each of these weeks, doctors provide a different medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, elevated, sugar, parasite diseases and mainly transferred diseases.
Others can get white or donated brilliant or free family list – a document that requires school, but which can simply allow many godly families.
The team works under local drugs a simple operation.
Operations are generally worked at the building school, at the officer or at home; after the operation, the patient is resurrected and gone to their training place to release the other patient.
With a light from the generator, the operational room and the hygiene equipment of Bwell and his volunteers are working in fast wound hours.
It's exciting, but musicians usually help team not lose motivation.
"And they stayed up and continued working, playing the whole night bubbles," says Bwell.
On Sunday, the team's going to go to the city, stuck, but he's fierce for his work.
This group, a group of camera doctors and medical students, has performed 700 free operations last year and realizes that their support can significantly mean for local people.
One man said that after the operation, he'd be able to work again.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
Besides organizing these weekly clinics and chirurgical work in Bwelle’s hospital, it also works tonight for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
It states that this second work is just financing about 60% of its non-request activities; the remainder covers private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he is actually sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studys medical at Drexel University in Philadel'a second year and works as a volunteer for the Bwelle Group.
They're always in the hospital or they're trying to get money for the organization so that they can do this campaign.
For medical and medical students, such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwell to his mission, it is a great practice they would not get home.
"Dr. Bwell, we were accurately cutting hands and removed blood boxes or holding tools to him," O'Malley says.
It's like a medical student in the second year in America you're never going to live.
Voluntary students usually pay their way to Camerun themselves and often come to the given medical needs.
But when he comes to Yaounde, heat, transport, and study gives them Bwell.
"Absolutely it's a herd," O'Malley says.
This organization gives his life and his desire to help the people of Camerun is unnecessary.
For Bwelle's inconsistent strike isn't a worm.
Helping others to live more happier, to fulfill the promise that he gave to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I'm doing this job," Bwell says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
To divorce people, to disturb their pain, that's why I do it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát renewed Hla’s sister for ChR
Claude’s sister for the CR should represent the interests of health sisters whose population is over 100 thousand in Czechland.
"I think it's too important that these are defined and formalized to have health sisters in the framework of the struct of the Authority - representatives to which they may be returned in case of need," explained Martin Holcat, Minister for Health.
I appreciate the work of my sister, and I think the choice of treatment is deserved to be given to him adequate attention from the Ministry.
In the course of this call, not only high professionality, but also human access and personal conviction.
"Good and with all responsibility, I'll try to make the steps that can improve the position of health sisters."
"We have excellent and weak sisters in our health, but I would like to call to those colleagues who don't help us with their access to patients to do their calls with all empathy and help us improve the picture of the sister's eyes," Alina Schmiedova says.
The new named Hla’s sister for ChR Alena Schmidava, in its opportunity to introduce to ́e, also concluded that he wants to take place with the most different aspects of the work of the healthy sisters and to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medicinal authorizations and doctors.
"I don't really want to separate the vocation of doctors and sisters, but I see them standing near itself, while everyone has his own skills, and together with other health works, makes a great job, a team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I'm alone to meet a number of problems that occurs when the sister calls, these hates and I'm going to share in their solution."
For example, there is a simplification of treatment and health documentation between them.
"For my own experience, I know that some of the administrators of the sisters are unfortunately disturbing and choosing their time that they can and should have the patient's rague," Alan Schmidova said.
Others, to which it is intended to focus, include improvement of workshops, seeking the road to better cooperation in the team and management of health providers, adjustment of competence and also working law issues, such as maintaining the law of work or uncontinuing their sister's inadequate number at the time and place.
We often hear anonymous paths that are not documented in a specific case where the rules may be affected by fear of the possible position.
"Where there is no complaint, there is no judge, and so Hlaa’s sister CHR could in this case serve as a guarantee for the preservation of such anonymity and a particular case to allow the competent authorities to check," concluded Alan Schmidava.
Mr. Alena Schmidava studied the Mediterranean Health School in the Mediterranean Sister (resolved in 1978) and the University Karlovy University University in Praze in the Watchtower - Pedagogic (resolved in 1992).
Since 2010, it acts as the leader of treatment and other non-medicines and recognition of the Education Committee and MZCHR.
During its professional career, she worked as a sister at the liver in the internal division, continued to act as a leader at the Mediterranean School, where she was 8 years of a statutary representative of the director.
Since 2004 to 2009, she acted as the primary sister of the CAR Service.
She published several professional teachers of treatment and articles in professional magazines, and the preliminary activity of treatment was updated.

That I don't want to hate
The writer Vaclav Kahuda returned to write after twelve years.
After long years, when he read, he lived, but didn't write, he issued VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) a new Romanian Wind, darkness, presence.
The fact that it does not refer to an appeal, the number of parties are comparable to its most famous part of Houwtin (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahud, another distinguished Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What was the point that you wrote Romanian after twelve years of silence?
I did it, so I wouldn't have hatred.
Seeing around yourself still new and new clones of the human malicious malignity, young organisms reached by blind selfish effort.
I don't even talk about us the elders, the spectacles devastated by the infirmity, the wexlate soul, and the opposed ideologists who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a small sale girl.
At the beginning of the thousands of years, I bought a little digital camera and brought up my legal friends, stupids, and spectacles.
I've been over.
Sometimes I feel how my brain burns from my life on this planet.
I'm going to go to the trip, and then I'll be at the lamp reading of the book tonight.
You're talking about the feeling of dead, hate.
Was there somewhere in the past a crime that affected you, or are you older as we all?
It's been a long time ago, a break in ten years.
It wasn't a name then.
Well, and I lived after that.
There's somewhere in there, but there's still a tired boy.
I see another single cvikyr, everyone in his tournament of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I'll participate in this roundable, thousands of years of life system movement on this planet -- this divorce of an incomprehensible future.
The unmarried, breathed complexity of life, when each stone is the direct inheritance of our presence.
We are players of mild and beautiful games when the way to try-omyl produces another and another generation of living, which creates a overlide, artificial intellectuality in milliards of interactions per second.
Twelve years are relatively long time.
Are you thinking of your writings as a transient process, or you've started completely from zero?
The self - speaking, or better speaking dialogue, which leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows to cold and forms it in the book.
As the periods of peace are prolonged with silent metastats of wars that may be wakened on one day, then my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt how my life's lawyer grows in my brain, and if I don't do anything, I'll be silent on one day.
It's a file of questions that the brain has formulated and put it on the levels that are stored in the darkness "below the domain".
Neokortex, the brain cow, is asked for elderly evolutional distress, is going to the former brain tree aircrafts.
He talks to the wounded beasts, asks for hairs, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, brings his eyes to the darkness of the cloud.
Yes, the darkness of the law in me and the stars of heaven above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you're exposing to the eg of metaphorics, could you definite it biologic?
The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical links all the experiences, experiences and experiences that the person concerned has experienced.
This boss of logic and emotionally exposed and with trees of information, memory records, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, which has been construed increasingly variable presence, trying to identify and understand its environment and decode important communications.
Sometimes there'll be a disaster from the deterioration.
Analogics - as if you "sleep" PC, from a vocabulary emulator and a translator of foreign languages you would first be moving in the operational Property, such as Windows, and after some insufficient restarts, you ended in the dark greenly blurting screens of Bios, in a basic system that manages and works on the matboard, between the processer and the operational memory, etc.
For those who haven't yet understood what the word is - I'm talking about the psychospiritual crisis.
You mention her often - why is this type of return regularly interested in you?
Because it's a jama.
In the course of the mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior, the breath will appear.
Here's a good feeling of Netzsche: "So he looked in the destruction when the destruction looked at him."
Risic feelings - that man's lost if he loses all of it, psychic "dead" and comes to a new quality.
And why is that personally interested in me?
I'll answer the parable.
Once one fell into the darkness, and touched himself, running days, months and years, he still washed, and then read, and the books taught him to flood, then live.
He's been a "smoking".
Hopefully, somebody will help me write it, as I've ever helped the Hrabal texts to me.
In what way do you think of readers, of a particular person who will read your text?
The one who can't say anything meaningful, one named 'dom', another super ego, but I think it's the best characteristic of Arthur Ribaud in the letter of a friend:
"I'm someone else -- this reader shares directly in the formulation process."
From the early youth, he read the books of old Czech pockets, shiped in the poorce'a No, running after the walls in dark wallets.
Finally, after all the authors and their messages, it sounds, "The sun is the worlds of other Karla Hynka Machy."
What if the book is outside?
Do you care about the reader view?
On a back-reference that will get to you through people who will read the book?
Of course, I am concerned about people who will take three hundred corners and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe after years, they contact me in the street and thank me for helping them my book in their hard life decision.
The books are "life" or "the worlds".
They are encoded in characters of letters, no experience, the history of regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them up to life when we let them go into the brain.
It is actually, in his way, something prohibited by God - to develop other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's the ability that DNA is stored in - according to the old demonological books, we're starting the chairmanship.
After the book delivered you -- how it was -- it's waiting for the copy reading.
I remember you ever read.
Are you going to go back with joy, or are you feeling that different after years?
I'm just going to tell you that today.
And what did I try to do with that?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic signs - they're inappropriate, they're not too advertising themselves, they have friendly exhibition, you're not feeling alone with them.
I'm giving an example - in the city of Red Costelec lived (and I hope he still lives) one quarnal bookbuilding (i.e. Red), a happy companion and a good girl boy.
At one drink, he presented me the individual articles of my Houstin book readers.
I looked for them in their eyes, and then he was shown me a distressed, ready copy of my book.
In the distress, I just put a divorced morning and soon wept manly.
We've been all there, we've been kissing, and we're throwing up, and we're throwing up.
Then the young blonde mixer didn't take it up and sprang out the head of the window into the snow snows.
It was in the ground.
We went out to the night country, and we took a happiness of sensitives, the painful soul of the nationals and the stream of the westless owners -- they went out and kidnapped as the whirlwinds until it was.
Each of your books is formally different from the previous.
Is it also payable for the text of the wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's an appeal about a country in nineteen rivers and nine hours.
Ivan Bunin, in his news of Sukodol, puts in the mouth of human treating words of an old Russian fear: on the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
It's a dog, it's throwing the woods on it.
Fear, distress, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it somewhere.
Perhaps we had been devils in the hell ago, and we lost-- what role in this land we're going to play.
You're worth keeping writing, or you're leaving it again on free inspiration?
The answers are fair - the Otokar of Brussels.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
What a major and unnamed movement of continents on the planet, affects our deepness and in the width that it is completely overcoming our view - and so we conceal exactly in the intentions of our programned task.
We are rewarded by dopamin, endorfine mixture and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to park, die in defense and obtaining new personal territory.
Sometimes it's going to be a hurt, and we're going to make sense of compassion.
Only then we have the right to call people.
This is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of different injuries, standing on the ocean area of unconsciousness, and in the swimming flash made from a spinal capsule takes the effects of the wheat.
I have to write to be a man.
Ambassador of health care
After the full criticism of the President Obama yesterday, the ambitional promise of his often repeated and ambitional promise that “as you like your health programme, you can leave it.”
With a revocation to hundreds of thousands of notices of responsibilities from the Provider of the Republic in recent days, the Chairman was accused of claiming the American public.
Obama was cut off from his p's promise yesterday.
"The majority of people who have a functioning health insurance can leave them," said in their manifestation in Boston.
In view of what he called "software in media" on responsibilities, Obama called the Americans who received this announcement to search for new results on the market.
Most people will be able to have better, more complex health care programme for the same price or even less than it was supposed.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administrative states that it should not be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who have purchased their own insurance could be proposed to change the programme because their insurance does not comply with the new requirements given by the Law on accessible care.
"I'm saying this to those Americans in the area: you're deserving something better," Zebelius said in his responsibility to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, watching the implementation of the Law on Available Insurance, said that the launching of the Internet market was from October "free".
"I'm disappointed and injured as all the ends," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
The subsequent Sebelius's holding, which he captured the locked microphone, said yesterday to the adviser of the Committee on the yesterday negotiation of the Committee, which was made after a painful exchange of opinions with the Republic of Billy Long, the representative of Missouri, who was concerned whether she should be involved in the Obam's programme of care.
More than three hours during the hearing of Sebelius, he repeatedly addressed the question why the "architect" of the Law on Available Insurance was not voluntarily granted to the Government of sponsored insurance, and did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which now offers millions of Americans.
What a billioner will you call next year?
Kellner, PPF group owner, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both undertakings have confirmed and, according to the most different resources of the Agency and of the accuracy, they have already been handed in the hand.
The notice of transaction should be reached in November, probably before the start of the frequency for the LTE network, so before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek own KKCG group.
This has been released under the label Sazka Telecommunications to the frequency for the LTE network.
And this is a general surprise, until that time, the company's shot was not talking to telecommunication.
But Sazku now leads a very experienced telecommunication boy Robert Cvatal.
He started as the marketing boss of the Radiomobile (then T-Mobile), afterwards became the director of the Slovenia T-Mobil and was sentled by the rocky bathroom of the same operator.
Sazka's playing a few cards immediately.
She's notified herself, and now she admits that she wants to start a chairman at Vodafon.
And he gives it a logic.
He will never succeed, so he will be able to move already existing clients from his own own operator.
This would probably not like Wodafon in normal circumstances, but, according to the information of the ESP, it may be a part of a much better cooperation with both fires.
Vodafons currently suffer with the agreement of competitive operators O2 and T-Mobiles who will completely share their network.
Wodaphones are so partners.
And that can be just Sazka.
This has succeeded in the LTE network (as a newer can hold a specially designed spectrum), so Wodafone does not have to run in total, respectively, to be guided by the deduction of only a spectra (not enough frequency for all).
The waterphones can share the network with Sazka.
Waterphones leave Sazku into their 2G/3G network (respectively newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), which allows the company to start the network.
The rate between this will begin to build a cost LTE network that will be able to use also Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then the money spent would be able to lose a strong internet provider or cab television.
And Kellner?
It would have received a Czech and Slovenian O2 (the Slovenian bathroom is a daughter of the Czech) immediately with a full-valuable operator with a continuous benefit and a broad offer of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big molecule that's gonna wait for restructuring.
The LTE network would already get Kellner for O2 and very probably with T-Mobile.
Both companies already wanted to share the network.
The Aukce could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the State budget is happy.
And since the next year, the clients in Czech could choose between calling with Vodafon, T-Mobile, Kellner or Comark.
Or two Czech Business Titans against Global Wars.
Does the Czech TV ever run without signing actions?
In the ear of the president of Zeman, the legendary scene with a pool is not hard to listen to the complaints that protect the evidence of the traveling of the building family.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Trddika did not document any such documentation so that it would be signed under this.
True, the leader's been the editors.
The cases described, however, do not answer the question from where such an advantage of some newspapers to the landscapes - whether it is response to direct negotiations, or not to use vulgarism, typical evidence of empathy.
And if we are supposed to be generally proud, we can not forgive the question whether the change in the TV does not affect other, at least without scrupulous potential interests that have been missing the opportunity.
The truth is that those who say that in developing countries there is no trial to send political interventions.
However, the truth is also that it does not mean that there would not exist complaints on public law media.
The triggers do not doubt their independence.
However, they criticize mainly what they consider as a trend that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this is not with us.
But it may also be in the country that thinks of itself that there is the most corruption of the world, the black white stories of bad politics and good newspapers are more convenient than the more complex descriptions of unspecificity, in which many imperfect human beings have been conducted.
JAN JANDOUREK: Prostitute of this country: President for the continued force
It is almost a rule that at the key moments of the country the head of the State was not in such a form to be able to comply with its state obligations.
If T. Masaryk was physically and mentally five years older, he would have reached the end of his presidential period and events around Mnich would have played a little different.
The war may not have won, but after symbolic opposition, the aircraft could fly out of the border, hard weapons were destroyed, and the government could go to London immediately and do not work there for its legitimateness.
And mostly, there would not have a nation of cocovine today.
Benas was not a Stater and he was still in Condise for Mnich, but for the war, he started to go out of the bathroom, and on February 48, he kept it.
To be better about that, he could leave the third to the exile and put the legitimateness of the communists and their shoes.
It's bad to talk about Hah.
They chose him with the "Man President doesn't get to the decision."
But he had to, even though he had a big decision with Hitler's noise on the knife, he wouldn't have been in the office.
Shepherd of the Divorce František Moravec, in the last days of March 1939, said what everything should be done so that the occupation on the day did not pass the Germans so cold and with such a winning.
The Senior President and the white government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human concern Godwald allowed his flying companions to correct, as Moscow commanded him.
The human freedom was definitively unable to participate in normalization, and they had to meet him, a whole senile.
That Husák was an unfortunate and sick depression -- older acts made it easy in November 89, but that's the only step.
Havel had the happiness that he was not in the office last years, he was saved from the worst.
Although Klaus is still fresh to the tennis, but many of his resources make sure that thinking processes are no longer what they were.
Well, now we have this here.
The head of the State and the top of the armed forces looks like it looks, and we don't even do it.
Congratulations are not threatening the external threats of the Republic now.
Or maybe it's dangerous, it's not just what you see.
Then the question is whether there is no exceptional (historical view) good that the President is not completely in force.
It's not normal.
Couldn't you choose a president in this country again once again a friendly and friendly healthy person?
Remote planets, black white movies or a little fantasy on foreign life on the earth are not the subjects that the American jazz saxofonist Wayne Shorter would overcome airports.
In the capture of his quarter, which on November 6, in the large street of Lucerna, the annual festival of the Struny sub-ground festival, all relates to all.
A quarter of the jazz saxofonist Wayne Shortera is the current feelings of musicians.
According to his task, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they just live.
They access music as a completely improvised cellular matters and think of none of the harmonisation or ritme, but of the film images.
This principle, however, is honestly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary recorder, nine-Grammy weaker, sometimes Milese Davis' partner, and today the largest lived jazz saxofonist - does not likely explain.
He doesn't speak too much about music, although his general view of life relates to music.
In my eighty years, I came to think they were the best to let life surprise.
"Too many people are planning everything and then they're disappointed when things become different," says Shorter.
How the mixers from Thailand brought up the markets of Paris bar
Perhaps you're worried over the wheat, and then you don't know that a half kilo per year you're totally voluntary.
For example, dead in the mouth.
You consume it at home, then you are unique trends: it's ecological, survival, and you've also experienced the unique results.
He ordered a fuzzy offer as the first in Paris on the eating letters of his business at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, the kitchen and the owner of Bar Le Festin Nu.
Bar, for whom the name was the inspiring book of William Burroughs Nay dinner, you would find in the modern 18th circuit near Montmartru a lot of visited tourists.
With a fresh avocade, cutched red papriks, a bridge and a cup of cups, new guests can test not only different larves, bottles, or water browses, to be throwned down there.
Increasingly and specially packaging supplies (for not to hurt the wheels, not to blame the feet or not to damage the eyes) they send Daviron to Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat holes, otherwise it's running.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pop-menu indicates just a few of the depths why to consume just a chmyz.
The ecological advantage is because the production of smoke is much less costable for our planet (which is financed, the Space and the water breakdown) than in the traditional mass.
"Besides, it's a fuzzy outstanding resource of whitewater and a limit of 3 plastic acids," said Daviron for the Re©s station.
Even a young kitchen doesn't stop his profession, he just claims to offer his clients a single culinary performance.
According to it, it makes a good restaurant of comfort, feeling sin and atmosphere.
"I don't save the world, I'm just making a new experience," he explained.
Not far from everyone, it would likely be an idea of how it consumes the brown of the deceased sea, but the reactions of the soldiers of the Paris bar on a serving wheat are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics are finally encouraging, even when they start the smallest systems and finally choose scorpion.
The prices of these degusts are moved from five to nine euros.
Chairman of Swaz businesses in the building of the CR Václav Matyas: New Green Strengths should continue
Since 2008, the Czech building has continued to reduce the volume of the prohibition and is not interested in the State to solve the investment exposure problem.
The report of the New Green Incidence programme was a positive signal for our building, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the measure has been implemented, increase significant amounts of exemption, but also opportunities for building companies and building weight manufacturers.
Each invested billion will bring more than 2700 new workshops to the State.
As regards the state's fiscal policy, it is important to packaging and multiplying effects, it is also one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the association of businesses in the building in the CRC is essentially not agreed with the resolution of the Government and requests the implementation of steps that would enable further continuation of the programme to make further challenges available in its competence.

Song shrn's coberc, president's shopping and finishing the barley
The president Miloš Zeman left the motolic hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he was driving night on the bed, and went to the lock in Lanch.
What's the health condition?
In the unprecedented recognition of John Kerry said that the American spion was too far.
John Kerry indicated the recognition of the United States defense position regarding its research programmes and in an unprecedented recognition he said that in some cases, the Spain was “too far”.
The Ministry also admitted that Barack Obamo is responsible for the emergency discovery of the NSA spending activity, which was revealed thanks to the reporter of Edward Snowden, acted as a "autopilot".
The information published was a diplomatic struggle between the US government and its associates.
Mr. Kerry's video connection to the open government in London said: "There is no doubt that the President and I have learned about some of the things that have been done from the contention because this was the possibility, with a reference to the Second World War, a difficult period of study war, and then, of course, on September 11."
He therefore became the first highly established member of the American Government, who admitted that the American spanship had exceeded the border, but highlighted that no rights were violated.
He said, "In some cases, it was too far."
And the President is determined to try to explain and explain it to people, and now it is conducting adequate review that no one feels that it has come to disuse.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry held that the NSA organization is seeking good and that her investigation operations have saved many lives.
And he added: "We will contact the new world in which people are willing to depart from themselves."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is strongly determined to kill and throw people into the land and attack governments.
What if you were able to catch it and stop before it happens?
We have been able to avoid the aircraft, not to explode buildings, and not to be restored to people, because we are already able to learn about these plans before.
The President of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs on Thursday said that the American legislators wanted to respond to Europe to the fears of the American spinners concerned, and they convinced the Europeans that they should continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, said that this week the members of the European Parliament and other persons have spoken and that they are concerned about their exhibition, that they will stop the anti-terrory organizations because they are deceived by the investigation of the National Security Agencies (NSA).
For the national and security interests of the United States, it is important that Europe remains with us on one ship, and that, as regards the common efforts to fight against terrorism, he said in Washington Murphy's discussion, a member of the Democratic Party and the President of the Senate Subcommittee of the European Affairs Relations.
And I move to Europe to show that we must continue to cooperate with terrorism, despite their extent on NSA programmes.
The media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, rejected the relationships with some American associations, although the leader of the Agency this week said that they were unexpected and reflected the uncertainty of the metadata collected by the NATO associates and shared with the United States,
Another discovery was sensitive to Snowden's documents that NSA had followed the phone of the German officer Angely Merkel and other 34 world leaders.
The leader of the National Rapporteur James ́pper Spainship of the associates felt as necessary and said it was one of both sides on the matter.
At the ex-march Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary road that should be successful this year, and he hopes that both members of the members of the delegation will appear in both sides and comor.
The following days will be published, namely, of the remaining lawmakers who are able to engage.
He said he was still working on the program.
Though Murphy said that the aim of the road is to help cope with relations, he added that they will be ready to be “supported by less educational measures”.
He said the European leaders must be respectful to their own people in respect of the Spanish programmes that they use themselves after a year.
"When we direct our research programmes and better protect European rights, they must also realize that we are not the only one who is running a spinner here," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry moves this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the immortality of the American Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and also the American investigation activities.
Australia rejected the residence in Thai process
The 11-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15-day procedures on the island of Phuket, when she was uncertainly claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, she rejected the verdict and was released on the shopping.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was on 15 June accused of the Court of Justice on the island of Phucket from a wretched accusation when the Thai police said that the taxi driver and two other men who had held it were attacked in the wound hours on Sunday 10 June.
However, the record from the industrial television was discovered that after she was broken with her Australian friend, she was safely returning to her hotel.
The police from the island of Phuket conducted conversations with Bamford two days before she learned that she had found her income.
It was held in the local police target before the court process.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days of processing in a fixed equipment with low care at Phuketo periphery, rather than to locate adult women's procedures.
It's a daughter of the former Australian lying player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help for the Ministry of Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks said to Sunday Telegraph, the whole family had "extreme concerns" about the judgment of her daughter and wanted her back to Australia.
"It's probably an emergency period, but we hope that it's going to come back to us first," Tunks said.
Bamford rejected the judgment and was released on the battle of 50,000 bahts.
The reports from Australia indicate that she has traveled a permitted in the Crabbi's recreation in the South Thailand.
The resources in Thailand claimed that Bamford represented the local lawyer in Phuket, but it was warned that a revocation could lead to a judicial procedure that her sentence increases and benefits in the location of adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian employee trip, the officer Michelle
Jagr whispered: Gol with a bridge?
He got a puck in a defensed shit, and nobody left it.
Moreover, the shower changed after the foreign call.
Jaromir Jagr thus covered the Tamp in the midnight, on Thursday evening, then 119. winner in NHL was a Facebook social network.
"When I looked at this video, my agent Peter Freedom answered the manager of the Czech Drags and asked him if I shouldn't be interested in making advertising on their most potential impact of Pendolino!" he wrote to the advice with the chairman Jagr.
We think we're typically very similar.
I'm probably gonna have to end with the night trains so I can't get any more.
"I'm afraid he could then call the Minister of Defense and want to make a public on the trick!" he added a smiley.
In addition, New Jersey wrote another victory in a series.
"And mainly, you have noticed - Mary Rottro's treatment," Jagr closed.
Place of authorization of bulga
Royal options more than the winners brought a buy of deceased.
These are not only parts that have been missing in the Missionary snippets (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous Governing Parties (ODS, TOP 09) and, finally, the CSSD for their internal division.
Instead of a celebration, the politicians kept us on the weekend of the approved guillas.
The choice has become the movement of Andrea Babische, which promised the electors to change the sustainable political rule.
The distortion of electoral outcome and divorce on the victory side plays political (z) because of Mr. Miloshe Zeman, without regard to the desire of elections who have not allowed the chairman's public support, nor have they been allowed to be sentenced.
Although the president has lost a strategic emergency from the final policy because of an inaccessible event, he remains still a few ways to get it back - such as the selection of the future premium.
While the CSSD's chances of getting the primary cross in my eyes are dismissed, the companies of Andrea Babiš are still approaching.
Although the optional development is still remote to the quick and cold creation of a stabil government, but in comparison with the preliminary scenario of the CSSD Left Government supported communities, this development is a better report for businesses in the CRC and therefore the economy.
In the light of the ONU's voice resistance to the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the CSSD, UN and KDU-CHSL (in total 111 cases).
In view of the divorce in the CSSD, which has become an unreadable and weak party in the negotiation, it may be the result of coalition negotiations quite covering the CSSD.
The Minority Government of the CSSD will probably not pass in the Garden.
Furthermore, any government in which the CSSD will be shared will be threatened by the uncomfortable ambitions of many social democrats that may lead before or afterward to another division.
So I'm asking myself, "Well, we're not going to make other preliminary choices?"
Other options would already be a reference to the force of the voluntary mandate to move the United Nations.
The CSSD plans for the establishment of sectoral taxes, the significant increase in taxes from revenue or building of the State bank have fallen under the table.
The CSSD, UN, KDU-CSL and the Support will, in contrast, be coherent for business support, coherent fiscal policy (regular deficit under 3% of the PDP), for the employment of disapprovaled persons, for the reduction of the DPH rate in the selected goods.
The third desktops are most displayed in view of the social policy and size of the State.
The ANO now has a proposal, so the program is still the most likely ANO, CHSSD, KDU-CHSL would have been increasingly transported.
What from my view is finally better outcome than the left program for taxing for everything that is still moved in the economy.
