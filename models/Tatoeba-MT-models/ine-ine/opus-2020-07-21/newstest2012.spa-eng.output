The Parliament does not support a amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Parliament of Ukraine has today made the proposal to reject the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code which is condemned by the leader of the opposite Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the doors to the exhibitment of the Minister, but the parliamentaries had proposed to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison by the present signature of an agreement with Russian disappearable for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet firm, the Court of Appeal has the obligation to revise it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political vengeance of the regime, and even in OÂe there have been doubts about the independence of the court.
The proposal for submission of paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code which was condemned to the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 members in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes would be required.
Libya's victory
The history of freedom, or of the liberal rebellion, has already losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the wilderness and without him there is no war.
Quit to define who the winner is
As it is already usually in the region, the islamists have won elections, but now it's about diluiting if it's about moderated or radical.
The National Transition Council has entrusted the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libia will become a country without crime, because the latrons will cut their hands.
Women can already go by emancipating themselves and the apostates waiting for their implementation and so successfully.
Instead of the dictator, the society, composition of warriors tribes, will be joined by the Coran.
In Libya there will be a order that we cannot imagine and that we are certainly not able to imagine.
However, our way of life is not the only or objectively the best and, probably, did not convince those already mentioned libios.
The truth is that it does not stop to surprise that islamic fighters will accept thankfulness for the help of the female dogs.
The only justification was that, from its view, the attacks of the NATO would not lead them to a general and large, but to Allah, whose greatness was held after each of the successful interventions.
When winners are looking for in Libya, O'e is not among them.
We are arrested in a tender of which islamists and our politicians are served to refuse a dictator in the person of a political alien without guarantees to gain benefits.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militaryly.
In this case, locals don't have a problem to expel the "crossed"
But without occupation, how will the oil be made with the black black gold only with good words?
It is pretty possible that no, but it may be that, finally, O’e can assume protection of human rights.
Always the sharia followers do not cross us.
Start a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to the feast of the investors' seeker
A statistical turbine has been extended by Europe
Individual States have published their PIB data for Q3.
The Czech economy has grown in the interquatermestral period, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the good market today has rotated records.
Investors are no longer defined in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistics of the Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third trimester.
The German PIB increased 0.5% of the proposed, France's 0.4%
Both countries have published the data of the second quarter, in Germany has improved more than expected (instead of 0.3% growth instead of 0.1%), although in France there was a light reduction of 0.1% (original data were talking about this rate).
Czech economy increased interannually 1,5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the interquadrametric period, the brutal internal product (PIB) has been decreased and the CSU is complied with the trend to gradual disaceleration in the growth of economic development.
The results are still worse than the analysis previsions.
Main events:
Interannually, the Czech economy increased in the third trimester of this year by 1,5%, but the quarter-meestal has been made.
In the third trimester, the German economy has increased the pre-calculated and stationally calculated data, and has increased 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and the European Union, between July and September and in comparison with the previous trimester, increased 0.2%, which consists of the expectations of analystes.
The Greek economy has fallen interannually on 5.2%.
The interest of their bonds at ten years is 28.45%.
The interest of the Italian and Spanish goods has grown up to critical limits.
Problem situation begins to affect Austria, Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of good cheques at ten years remain at 4%, although the situation in the area is threatening.
In Germany are votes that say that the ECB should grant loans in the last instance.
Czechs are classified for Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrated the classification with a premium 200 million.
The football team complies with the most difficult work of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Czech and the portier Petr Jiráček, the victory was given for 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of happiness at the second time, was fantasticly defended from the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the European campaign.
IHNED.cz was detailedly followed by the development of the party in a mining report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of happiness in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the destruction of the local team to the end, and also the excellent game of Chech and the Heroic Jiráček, wined by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its pass to the European Campeonate.
As a result of the corrective Czech defense, the Montenegros did not press up to the second half.
The two damaged party were Damjanović and Vučinić, who left two great times.
Moreover, thanks to genial Petr Čech, the eleventh Czech will not be missing at the meeting of the European Copa, so the arches of the national football will reach an approximately 200 million crowns.
Since the first minutes, a good offensive game has been given.
Both teams started just to keep the lines and played nothing more in the field center.
There was no pressure of local players in the first half, patents to another defence field, just what the defense of the Czech is supposed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They made a human escudo.
Several hundreds of university students have made human escudos around nuclear installations in Iran.
They want to express their support to the nuclear programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray on Wednesday at midnight before the installations and then joined Slovaks of death to the United States and Israel.
Several hundreds of university students made the morning in the Iranian city of Isfahán human escudos around the nuclear technology center in which it works with uranio.
They claim to demonstrate that they are willing to defend the nuclear programme of their country with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA), in a recent report, noted that Iran, if all indications were set out, was dealing with nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students began to pray at midday before the nuclear installations of Isfahán and then launched slogans of death against the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose goal would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be achieved, not only the center of Isfahán, but also the installations of Natanz, where urian is rich.
Daily Menu of a obesity child: not divorce and dinner embedded
More than one third of children of age between 9 and 13 have over-peses problems, where the over-pess affects 9% of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Obesity children go in their majority of families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, it is discovered of current investigations.
There is again evidence of the importance of the environment in which it grows for healthy development of the person, as well as of the models of reference.
In the table, for example, children are fed of at least double-frequency embusts than family children normally.
For mealing, more than 19% of the obess had divorced fresh patates on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention programme "Obecity is not a chaʹtiness".
In the over-break children's families there is no custom to practice sports, which is applicable to most of the current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
900 children's survey
The survey was carried out at the end of the past school year and participated in the same nearly 900 basic educational children in all Chech.
It was the second and second of the programme of "The Obesity of not a chat", which supported the Safety Company of San General and the Unilever.
Even now, more than 12 thousand children have participated in the project from the fourth to the eighth course.
A suitable and quite family exercise diet are determining factors, which make note decrease the number of children with over-pess and even obesity.
"Only half of the questioned children have answered that they have five daily foods is the scheme: divorce, holiday, food, dinner and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," he collects one of the results of the investigation.
No swimming but embedded to screen
Specialists warn that, in healthy development, the details are also important, as for example, to have a fixed time for family discharge.
Nevertheless, only 23% of the school families were spent at the same time.
In most of the families, each one is deceived alone.
But the worst was to discover that in 10% of the homes nothing was disappointed.
However, the dilution is the base of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in the family of obesous children, fridge paintings are much more frequently consumed.
Almost everyone - independent of the weight - drink the sweet sweet daily (70%).
Generally, they make more than 40% of the children concerned, however, in their parents, this result is reduced by less than half, only 15%.
Fabric your diet
The next stage of the study enabled the chosen hairs (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 college) to create their own diets from all possible offers.
"The food preferences of the Czech children in age between 12 and 15, from the view of a healthy food, are very far away from the ideal."
Among their favorite foods are the papa, the flesh and the sweet
"It is especially alarming the popularity of the sweet refreshes," it is warned in the final study report.
As the main food, the palm is carrying the map and following the bird's meat closely.
Practically, children always have grass and pleasure for fishing and vegetable is very low.
Switch to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their food habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of participants in the study, which filled the questionnaire after the end of the prevention programme "Obecience is not a chat", in many cases a significant change was made to the principles of healthy food," it was pointed out in the results of the study.
Call attention, for example, regarding sweet refrigerators, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also choose bird meat and fishing for the main food more frequently in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and hair derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, support professionals
In the introductory article, how the stylists are, I was a little worried that the initial lessons were already very loaded.
I didn't know how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals of the branch, how to dress problematic persons and also a seminar on how it works in the world of the spectacle.
And it'll be worse.
How closer are final examinations, more information and practical tasks expect us
And although the course is developed every Sabbath and Sunday, it doesn't have any alphyler anymore.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who has no perfect symmetry.
And that's the great majority.
Someone is cuellicort, someone has a stylised figure without the appropriate curves and somebody suffers overweight.
The stylist must know optically swimming some wide spots, expanding a wheel or recreating the needed curves
We have given some trucks about how to highlight the body of women of the kind of Jennifer López, of big clothes and stones but cincture is, and at the same time not clothing it in a too difficult way
If, for example, the difference between the cinture and the stairs is so much that the wheel or the pantalons are not adapted, the pen is worth to make cook at least one extra screen to measure.
They will certainly not repent, because the clothes he feels perfectly impugnable.
With a measured wallet you will feel much better than with one that is not to move, rise up, dance in the circle, etc.
The stylised body can be allowed to dress clothing with clothes, adornos, borded or sliped.
There are certainly many types of different and body information, so I am happy that I have all the week to order all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assigned task, I have more than above.
To each participant in the course, two famous ones have been assigned to which two clothes must be designed: one for day and one for night.
It must be taken into account the current aspect, the mode style that corresponds to the person concerned.
He touched me to enter Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's secret campaign.
I cry inside, for me is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which lastly will have enlarged some hundred kilos ( please take into account the exageration), or the youngest Selena Gómez.
The clothes we have to cut them out of the magazines or search them on the Internet and print them, to then draw them graphically.
The moodboard, which is as called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphical design.
It is also important to think about the graphical part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, has not only seen physically, but also occupied the products pages in the magazines (detailed subjects such as tendances, bottles, bulks, etc.).
All of that the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik spoke to us.
But all this is left for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialists invited to encourage the Sabbath Conference with information on any kind of body.
The Honza Pokorny stylist, the Jakub Polanka Mode Designer and the Ben Renč Mode Mode Graph.
Jacob reminded us that the mode is an illusion and the stylist should know to take it away.
And a good stylist knows to work with the same clothes of clothing in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such gabardin (or in English, trench-coat) can be dressed to the classic with vackers and camisetes, but it also serves to dress the deep body with tacons and photograph it as if it was actually a clothing.
Or it's enough to pull it up and up the wheel to get a totally different image.
"Jugue with that," he insisted on us.
The most valuable is the following advice: "To begin working, you must first know all the rules."
"Therefore you can break them," said Jakub.
Finally, I am clear why we remember all these forms, what is combined with what, if then it results that we find different results in mode magazines.
That's without talking about defiles.
Thanks to the ́Group Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reservation that he wants to photograph.
So, for a mode history that has ten pages (so, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifty.
In addition to the photos, the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them are different to which they are used in reality.
All that must be taken into account at the time to design outfit.
Honza Pokorny assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, the half of success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly a extraordinary song, but the picture and marquetin have made her a world star.
In Czechland, there is still no clear trend to use stylist services.
Even famous persons also find it unusual (I'm worth my ability, my physical aspect doesn't have so much importance).
And when someone asks us our services, you must notice that it's very different that they indicate us a very different tape than his real (small).
Thereafter, it's just a guilt and notice whether the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has engrossed/adelgazed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted on us that the stylist doesn't suffice to be guided in the mode, but he must understand outfit.
His work, especially with the people you have seen, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
You know appreciate people, not less, defense their opinions.
"When a director contracts you to classify his clothes and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't take and take all that was and say, "Hey what worse"."
"Find at least a few things you can weigh and recommend that someone can put them," said Mario.
He also showed us that everything must be in the name "placovka", namely the workboat.
This is fixed around the cinture and all necessary tools have been made.
They are objects such as tigers, such as tigers, kitapeluses, or imperdibles. There are also nailon hilo (serving to the stylist during the seat of photos of products such as bottles or fats), special clothing pinces forward, if this was greater (the alfilers and other types of bottles are not allowed, so they could damage the tissue), or a cotton game.
To not stay in the hearing passive and practice, we have been able to clothe the ground of the shoes.
Even during photographs in the study, in a plain surface, the ground could be hurt and much more outside.
And we didn't do anything more than clothing and clothing.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the tigers so that we could not hurt them for a accident.
So it had to be very fair.
Mario gave me a joy in praising my job without reservations.
The truth is that I don't have such abilities very well.
This is just a small part of all we have heard during the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedication to the stylism at professional level is not a rose path, but it gives me exactly the same thing that people say.
A Need for Speed: The ́s competite throughout America.
Reminder
A traveling, in principle disoccupated, is complicated due to a series of impropial disasters of a routine travel during the morning turn.
In a certain measure, it was intended to cover expectations, but it does not serve anything, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which the title is added to the title, was awake great expectations before its alien.
I promised that I would give new raises to the former Need for Speed carriers and, in the root of that shown, appears as a game that should not end again to be a kind of action without any more.
We also feel interesting in knowing how the scenes would remain, where the main characterization descends from the car and walks by its own feet.
As it seems to happen in the NFS series, the results would not vary much about what we expected.
There are carriers that can be given by acceptable, but in the total climb are lost points due to absurd failures, which already appear in the series since years.
In fact, it cannot be called errors, but it is better about the incomprehensible disagreement of the programmers.
The aventure begins very well.
You are introduced in a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout the United States.
You're sitting at the flight in the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is coming first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The road is divided in ten steps and then in more than fifty careers.
It is deducted that each carrier has a different path and the stages are located in different areas, which are very different and interesting.
In this way, one doesn't have any remote feeling that the game offers always the same.
Some of the environments are even enjoyable in view, although the technical level of the graph is equal to the previous delivery of the series.
That's why it's nothing from the other world.
But the past through the wilderness, the otonal landscape or the high mountains of snow produce a very pleasant visual effect.
Moreover, carriers are separated from time to time for an atpic element.
So, for example, in the wilderness, you find a sand storm that reduces the visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you need to be careful so that you don't bury a wallant.
It is that, each of the careers is very well developed.
There's just a couple of models, but it's enough.
You have a moment, try to advance a number of rivals (normal in a classic career), then you try to win time (classic cronometered) and then wait for a threat against one single opponent.
In the middle of all this, the police sometimes appear, which does not make but make things more difficult.
The newness is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you need to help him, always clicking the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
However, it is amazing that there are much less landscapes in the game than you could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not come to be worried and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game becomes more interesting.
The model of driving follows the winds of the previous episodes.
That means that today it isn't a big thing, but it can't be bad.
If you are looking for a real simulation, you can already look at anywhere else.
But a career conceived with a lot of action is worth enough of this driving style, although we can find something better between competition games.
Till here, all right.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
In contrast to the right of the driver models, it does not happen the same with collisions.
Games of this type do not need to expect to recreate complicated deformations and collections, but actually before a fight against any object, you can't predict how your car will repair, with which it's not all in order.
It is typical that, by making a very adjusted progress or holding the car with a normal traffic, there are only light rocks, but in other nearly identical placements, your car ends making uncontrolled pireetes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the resetting system, there are no big problems, but it can cause you to lose humor.
Resets are scheduled so that, when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last random point in the track.
However, in each career there are only five reserves available.
If you consume all of them, you have to restart the career from the beginning.
So it's not more than a help if something doesn't work well, but it's not much to trust.
Sometimes, neither resetting help, only helps to acquire the given step of memory.
A great disagreement of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, it is necessary to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Sometimes you're on somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, although you're the first, five or five minutes before or later.
This makes it worry about all in employments, when you see two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your counterpart continues without problems, but when you come, you should turn or swim.
It's the same as you've come, because it's scheduled because the "surprise" will always happen before you in you.
In addition, opponents have another benefit.
All the game will come to sites where, without taking into account the moment, the same opposer will always develop you in the same place.
Moreover, this happens at the end of the game, in a long pool, which results even more shocking.
Your opposite must come before you, to the price anyway.
When he goes before you, the vision of the cars coming before you, so on the beginning you can make the car pail.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum suspension and adrenalina dose, but the execution is so apparent that it certainly deceives you.
And it's a pen, because although the model of the travel is simple, the game is fun and with action, so often it is not possible to follow the details what happens or where.
And actually does equal, if the debt takes the idea with fifty tracks or classification in the carryer so that it doesn't break the shame, or anything else.
A idea is the change of cars during the cars.
You must be careful about gasoline surrounders at the side of the road, because you just have to change the car, even though most of the cases will suffice what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports are suitable for urban areas, the American strong cars for right travel and super-sport exotics for a technical drive, for example by mountain roads with curves.
Furthermore, the main story has also appeared a hilo of parallel challenges, namely, there are careers in concrete places that you will know for stories.
Here you will get not only medallas, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for challenges and accounts.
When reaching the top level, the driver opens several options, starting by the car and finishing with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is a online Autolog function connected, which compares your results to other players and makes other Community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last career is done in history.
With the car you come to the metro tunnel (passe), where you start running to dark roads (passe).
The speed cimeter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly the convoy of the metro comes behind you and takes you forward without any more.
In the redaction we'll certainly have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game nobody thought if it was a little or if the real authors take us by a bowl panda.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most of the pleasant cases, sometimes to surprise.
After what it thinks, at the most tensous moments, the quality of the image is reduced and sometimes in a serious way.
This particularly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the image quality is not valid anymore.
Audio is good and the sound band is a question of pleasure.
To be of the pleasure to most of the youth group, the sound band belongs to the category "one of your father and your mother", but it can be supposed that nobody would buy the game only for your music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The日 is so very confused.
If the game avoids absolutely foolish errors, we would have problems with the thee is the best NFS game in the past years.
Give the feeling that the game is not finished.
The divorce is safe, but prepared because the errors will strike you in the eyes with the strength of some port reflectors.

The campaign before the EU, Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation of negativists and eurosceptic.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war to be mounted without a quarter."
"There will be five, six years before the situation is a little stabilised, calm, and the new players are used to their new roles," thus empired with conviction their conference in the Right Faculty of the Czech Employment before the EU, Millena Vicenová.
How not be taken seriously its "clairy and openly on Europe", which has already said in the first part of its conference, when he has convinced each EU institution and its relations with such precision and clarity, because it would be the enviation of many conferences of the U. Carolina Rights Facility.
Vicenová also focused on the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first arises critics, that if it's insult, a green officer, able to take any role, but I have to say that he left all unconcerted, because he takes his roles to the perfect."
"It is a man who can listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of representative of the External and Security Policy is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore important to unify and clarify the political union of States like China or India.
No one wants to make us the Olomo's chess
Vicenová has also been occupied with the continued agenda, continued and will follow the European Council in the next future.
The Czech Presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs were occupied of the emergency economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summary for the East Association.
The government's fall at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Chech.
Czech representation in the EU has now many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "good abortion", not only the presidency but also the financial crisis, which is currently being treated.
On the other hand, the budget for seven years of the EU must be approved, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is more simple and effective, what sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and what less? That is something that will be present in the next agenda.
The ambassador also remembered its main leases, with which he came to Europe: "About Europe with clearness."
"The truth is that I don't like famines, foreignisms, or jewels that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the pepines are not actually invented by the curve or rounded pepins, the platains of various sizes or that no one will make us the Olomo's chess?"
It also intends to make more use of the EU environment and draw closer to more Czech citizens to European institutions.
We expect Europe of Speed
The emphasis is low, the Czechs have a fame of euroseptics, and people understand more the negative aspects than positives.
Moreover, it was sorry for the low participation of the Czech in the European institutions.
The fault is of many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czech.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"I believe that when they come to me a Poland and a Hungarian and approach me a Slovak, a French at my side says, "What, you've already been, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it is seen that he doesn't have any grace."
In the future, in the EU, Vicenová, expects new long-term budget policy rules for Member States.
It is feeling very real about the concept of the two speeds, if they are not more in Europe than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen space and we have also the strengthened cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries that want and those who don't, that they remain out."
"These procedures will be more and will strengthen Europe of the two speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, it also highlighted the role of Chech and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, where all the issues affecting the entire EU should be discussed between Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
History Brand:
The innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone looks for a term that would determine the IBM strategy, the most addicted would be "large term".
For the general public, the IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is current and has been over 100 years since its foundation.
The base of this long-placist character set the first head of the signature, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He already found the lemma that many problems in the world have a solution if people are ready to think.
His lem "Think!" became his mark, which will return to build the life of the gigante future (is also the title of an internal magazine that IBM empe· published in 1935).
Watson was also the basis for a carefully raised enterprise culture.
"For us, IBM includes a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has overcome and prosperated for hundreds of years because he has remained faithful to his basic principles, but without fear of changes around.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper more in our second century," he warned during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees as the Baťa company in Chequia (the IBM employees were of the first operators and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The same long-term sophistication maintains IBM in relation to the client.
From the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (as one of the first world businesses in the end of any kind of discrimination, he could choose without problems).
On the line of the antidistribution strategy is the current IBM plan, so Palmisano will replace it in the year that comes a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has already worked for thirty years in IBM, where she has been manager of sales, marketing and strategies.
The last years of the IBM has participated in the calls of online conferences, rain of ideas, and of the infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that the ideas are over, because they work almost half million people in the signature.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM held a concept of institutions more than of technology company," -- the Professor Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that decides to solve business problems for users of technology," George Colony punishes Forrester Research advisor.
As the company own says, there is a difference between entering business and creating just a business.
IBM - or "Green Green" - as it is known in the United States familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the last hundred years.
It is probably the most verbal technological company (developing both teams and programs, infrastructures and services in a broad range of services, which come from servers to nanotechnology).
The largest number of patents of all North American technological companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel premium.
Among their invents are the autocamper, pay cards, financial permutations, bar codes and diskettes.
IBM will make this year $220 billion. This year has become the second technological signature by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when he was first overcome in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking at the Future
Not all products and innovations are just satisfied with customers' pleasure and time (IBM hasn't paid by their own operational system, OS/2, prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it can't be emotionally announced in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano recognized.
Therefore, IBM has no problems to build its bases on other platforms (and, if they do not work, it leaves them).
And that is the difference of competition, Microsoft, which mainly keeps and always falls with Windows.
Future technology
In the case of sales, IBM is especially dedicated to services, of which approximately one fifth is programmes and another five equipment.
However, in 1990, the teams represented more than half of the percentage of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold lower performance assets for a total of $15 billion. In the same period, he has invested $58 billion in future technology buying.
Investment has been followed since 2008, when modern world financial crisis was opened for the first time.
IBM acts with the premises of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the large economic crisis of 29.
It seems that even now the IBM company has known to understand the crisis.
The value of IBM actions since the beginning of 2008 has increased strategy to 120%, the net benefit of the company has not stopped to increase.
The IBM division is changing everything, except its value.
Therefore, it can be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible gigant will endure.
IBM story: from shortage of chess to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was already adopted in 1924 - originally it was a mark used in Canada and South America’s branches.
The basis that the IBM was born is combined from the combination of four companies that are remonted to the 1880 decade.
He had invented such as the "fishing hour" that allows the input and output of employees to control.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint business man, who also presided its supervisory advice until 1930.
Flint set the leader of a company of competition, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader encountered the IBM founder (Watson's ideas continue to be the firm basis on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson guided the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated in its name, empe日 with the production and sale of all types of equipment for business, from meat shorters and chess to register boxes.
In the first four years that Watson guided the company, the facture was doubled in 9 million dollars and emphasised the large extent of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial for the company that, almost forty years after occupying the head's shelter, he was substituted by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM is able to work in the development of artificial intellectuality and has developed the first programming language.
In the 60s, IBM's staff and computers helped NASA to drive flights to space (to Mercurio, Saturno, and in 1969 the fleeting to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pecés", which introduced the computer standard at that time, reached the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in its part, bought the part of the consultation of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a full added advice and services.
The strategy that IBM has paid these last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, namely "a smarter planet".
Its goal is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or improved, for example, in relation to transport and urban administration.
For the trade sector, IBM presented not much the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows minorists to manage the full commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932, she opened a branch in Checoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM CHR also operates the externalization strategy center in Brno.
The seat for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. There is also a worldwide research team that works with the voice recognition.
Political information on the husband's efiel:
Iveta, stay on that bowl that I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtář (53) said, he's over!
After his husband Joseph Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lovers, Darina had the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rose dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can return home, but no longer as my partner," explained the Richterary.
When Darina Rychtière attended Bartosh in her house during the summer, she couldn't imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Ričany and Pepe didn't leave the song.
He even declared publicly that he loved her.
With time, Darina was rejected, apparently accepted the relationship of her husband and even dismissed him forever.
And Rychytário doesn't care with who his wife is accused.
If a day Richtář would break with Bartošova, his wife wouldn't wait for him at home with open arms.
It's the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw it out."
"But here I would live not as my dear and old boyfriend who was wrong, but as a man who joined me some legs," Rychtářová said and felt that she had already dismissed her husband and insisted only on the mutual respect.
Joseph doesn't care that his wife has shut the door behind.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on the paper and I respect it."
"The company continues to enter into force, I do the house arrangements, I care about the garden, the house, I make the purchases."
"Darina and I are talking normally, the only thing is that we don't have a bed," said Rychtário.
If the Richterary finds a new love, he wouldn't answer.
"We don't sleep together, and she doesn't care about me, nor where he goes or if he has a boy.
I know that it's my fault, I loved Iveta, and I'm assuming all the responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vicious of women: Are they also referring to you?
If you ask men to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will be appointed without thinking.
Gentlemen, do you recognize in the following lines, where some female vicies are quoted that can make the blood of the males?
Go to purchase
Does he reproach the middle of his naranja that has the dependency on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least a trap per week?
Do you like to buy sometimes in the ships?
Then, in your case, you can say that you're going from purchases has become a vicious.
Some women realize that they should pacify their passion for purchases, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the attempt to pass without any more by the clothes of clothes, looking for well adjusted clothes and then trying them all in the tester (deeply in all different colours)?
Although for the majority of women go to purchase is a pasticipant, for men can become practically a breakfast.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner that he's better waiting for her before the door.
Constant insatisfaction
"I'm not too bitter?"
"Will you need to give at least five pounds - should you begin to exercise?"
"I really like you?"
Don't you sound these words?
What is it?
Then it's one of those women who's looking forward.
It is not that you should stop being careful, but many men are allergic to listen to your partner's whole time of your physical aspect.
The strong sex is also agreed that as far as the frequency of wounds increases, more distress women return.
Order and order in the first place
It's like an infinite tiev.
Clear the windows, pass the aspirator, break the ground, remove the powder, break the bathroom and all that at least two times a week.
Does he rebuke his partner that he has slew the ground with a swimming foot, his children who have sworn a recent lavabo and a station with glass doors that so much costed him to be stuck?
If you suffer this "deviation", you would be conscious that nothing should be exagered and that the order and the order must certainly not be primary in the family.
This undeserved desire of devotion could threaten its relationships and family welfare.
Make unappreciable comments
"The useful calcillos leave with the sweet clothes."
"You want to put you too tomorrow those calcetines used."
"The mosqued trap isn't left on the ground!"
If you make these comments to your couple more times a day, you know that so you can get it out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything okay.
Maybe, if men knew this, women would not do so many comments.
Columns and chismes
Some women also take the wounds, chismes, but also offences and conspirations against someone.
Women focus on relations, so they like to talk together about things of the guy who, where, with whom, how and why.
At the best, each of us sometimes escape a small and inofensive chism.
With the hand in the heart, this is almost all women.
On the other hand, there are chismous women of those who do not control themselves, whom they like to kismore and do it often, get all away and become dangerous for those around them, especially in a female working team.
Jagr and Voráček helped with their assistance to win Philadelia
The front of hokey Jaromir Jagr participated on Monday at NHL meeting with two assistants that brought the victory on Philadel 5:3 in Carolina's cancer and put the Czech players back in the vanguard of competition.
In both cases Giroux used the playing of the 39-year-old star, and gave another step and was declared better player of the game.
Two assistants were assigned in the party and also Jagr's companion, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jagr came to the ultramary journalists that Giroux had preached a great night.
"Before the party, I had told you that I would do a triple."
"I had it."
" Sometimes they seem emboss," Jagr explained, after his action has given him a goal to Giroux, the root of the first strike of the Flyers.
One time later, the second intervention of the team also had a check track.
Voráček was made with the disk behind the Urricanes portary and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, which put it gol.
One second before the first pause, a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the beginning of the second part, the Flyers were already dominated.
Concretely by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr, he put the third goal, after his shooting was shot through the Wayne Simmonds portrait.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean it's the best player of the cancer, but it's certainly among the three best," Jagr weared to his central.
"Never would have happened to me that at the end of my career I'd play with a sporter like him."
"I'm very satisfied with that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my companions played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jagr.
Carolina still converted the game into a drama, with the gol of Tuom Ruutu, and then again from Dwyer, of penalty, until he was put into a remote gol.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, even though they were overcome in number of two against one.
"Pronger had a good action in our field."
"Stop the disc, I took speed and Read went to the most remote part."
"I've been trying to touch the disc and I'm happy because I've got it," Voráček described the last goal of the game as he lived.
With her victory, Philadelia has been headed on the East Conference.
The Czech Defensor of Montreal, Jaroslav Spaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third, with a lesson on the top of the body.
The Canadians didn't just lose a player with much defense experience, but also by a difference between two goals, 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec wasn't able to use one of the shots.
More than the lost points to the local trainer regreted the large number of lesionates in the last row, and playing the game with only five defenses.
"It's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest was new."
"End, but it is that nothing can be done against it, we have to handle it," said Jacques Martin.
"Too much to rotate the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify more the game, take the disk out of our field."
"And so let us leave rooms," explained one of the defendants, P. K. Subban.
The Porter Ondréj Pavelec contributed with thirty interventions of Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were marked by five players that thus ended a number of wounds that had already been spent five games.
How travel prices have been developed since 1989
By 1989 there were only five authorised State travel agencies in the Czech Slovakia: Chedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time sold in most cases only to the socialist block, because the traveling to OÂe were very restricted.
The Czech tourists therefore went from vacations to the RDA (Democratic Republic of Germany), the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (ambas in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive impact was the period comprised between 1962 and 1972, when it was able to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslavia regime moved to the west and the travels of the Czech tourists were then very restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist block (or also the Czech Slovakians) would not be allowed to travel free and individually or by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a invitation letter, if not, the individual travel was not possible.
The travel agencies also offered travels to the West, but one should have been put in the school with a sack of sleep and so throughout the night, or having "good wells" in the agency.
I wasn't even like that.
The name of "changing promise" that was the with" for travel to Western was not allowed to the "politically smallly reliable gentle" that couldn't be able to travel absolutely.
The Checoslovaquian currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without change guarantee, was not able to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to O日e.
The majority of the Czechs passed their vacations in their own country, so there was a large number of cakes and soil houses, which the cheques would buy.
The way of traveling in the Czech has suffered a true revolution since 1989.
While until 1989, it was not going to pass the vacations in the RDA or Bulgaria, the past year, the Czechs made 4,5 million vacation travels to countries worldwide.
It comes to a great paradoj, which today we are not conscious of, the fact that to the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989, it could not be freely traveled, because it was part of Yugoslavia from that time.
At the beginning of the 1990s, the exemption of visa was imposed to travel to the Neighbourhood States of Western Europe, which caused an enormous oil of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czech Slovakians, for a long time, were not seen harden from the excursions to the West, all wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, check groups were sleeping in the parks in campaign tents, because our income from then did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the cheques at that time was to take food (conserves, embedded, etc.) to cover.
Another important moment was the introduction of the conversionability of the Czech coron, so our tourists could finally, after de·s, buy freely west currency.
Our lives level increased and with it the average salaries, which caused an increase in the request of traveling around 1997.
With the increase in the request of travel, the agencies began regularly from 1997 to prepare travels using chatter flight connections, which made increasingly decreasing the prices of traveling in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
At the end of the past 90th century, the Czechs have already traveled unvisibly to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of the post-revolutionary tourism occurred in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a great request, the first direct flight from Chech to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, the roads of chat with chec tourists were part of every year, made remote and warm countries, and this winter will fly directly from Czech to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting them approximately 100 thousand cheques per year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States removed the views for the Czech tourists, with which our country was among the most developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have passed more than half of their vacations in the foreign (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have been spent in travels to the foreigner over 15.000 cheese crowns per head, including the expenditure in the station site.
Convocated General Ordinary Assembly to choose the President, which could end again in a dead point.
From almost five months ago, the Czech football is unpresident and it is that the successor of Ivan Hashek as President of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAČR) will not be known nor after the convocation of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, there has not yet been an agreement on the following voting rules.
Without the same, it cannot be voted if it is to choose between the three candidates.
The interested and presidented the Czech football is Jindrzych Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás.
Hashek rejected his charge in June not before calling his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew to take care of the football in the future.
However, after Hashek's era conclude, a conflict between the two federalities of the association incapable of reaching an agreement to choose a common candidate.
It remained in evidence on 16 September when the new president had to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly were gathered forward in the National House (National Dom), which was in the campaign of pleasure of §ichov, because the conversations had been locked and not only regarding the method of election.
No consensus has been reached nor has the right to vote at the General Assembly - only the legal representatives or the delegated with full powers.
Since that time and due to this only point, a partial agreement was made, also supported by the Recommendation of the State and Right Institute, which is not possible for the representation of full powers.
However, electoral code discussions are still open.
More light on the situation could no longer be removed by the Executive Committee that, at its meetings, would, or extraordinary, was based on nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has been changed a few times, but the neurological point is still the same.
The question is the following: How do you follow in the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The discussion turns back to whether it should be in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Presidents of the FAČR, which, from the direction of the association, represents the professional football.
The model proposed in the statutes shall be made, in the third round, win the candidate with a greater percentage of support in the Federation to which its candidature will be presented.
The Region of Moravia is willing to reach a commitment to gain the candidate with a greater percentage of votes in both federalities.
The Bohemian part, however, emphasizes that the winner, if these percentage estimates, must have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, remove the sense of the two previous rounds and completely refuse the concept of bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the objections of the living party, if it would be the best to not touch the order and vote is the applicable statutes.
With this, surprisingly, it is also agreed to Tomaš ։ Although the electoral regulation should be set out by the statutes of all candidates is more agreed to Pelta.
"I would like to vote at the maximum according to the statutes."
"In order to not imagine any stupidity about representatives such as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is first posted as candidate and leads its observations mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimist.
It is he, in Nymburk, will be decided about the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All patients will pass with today's party of our national team in the European Campeonate.
"The football will again be protagonist, and so it will work more pleasant" – the representative of Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in the management of football, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most ridiculous.
"I hope that it comes to an agreement, but, despite all, the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between bohemies and residents, but it's trying to adapt the rules to its own conviction."
"This may have a new block of the General Assembly."
"In all ways, I hope that the common sense will be impressed," said Rajchl.
There's no longer a long time for all parties to reach a agreement.
Some negotiations had to be carried out in Montenegro, but who can know until the party starts if the football team is complete?
The special aircraft, where they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not come out this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to look for a alternative to transport a part of the Executive Committee to the place where the classification party will occur.
Maybe the decision-making, finally, may be that will take place at ministerial level, which, if they are counted, will be celebrated on Thursday.
Joseph Dobesh, Minister for Education, Youth and Deports, would like to include the parts divided into the most powerful sport organisation in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot in play: State subsidies, football credibility and also the next General Assembly of the Czech Republic of the Czech Federation Committee (CSTV) that will give a new address to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka Lotteries House.
It will fight to reach the presidency because there is no more appropriate candidate.
If the head of Pilsen's footballists, Tomaš ։ Like before the Excellent General Assembly, the name of an appropriate candidate would meet all his ideas on the new President of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FACHR) would not be presented as a candidate to a so relevant position.
"If there was a proper person, I would fight for her and wouldn't present me as a candidate to the elections."
"But until today a person could not be found like this," he said for the Czech News Agency (ChTK)
What motivates the Âglik to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the suspected winner of elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAČR).
It also punishes that, in the case of winning, it would remain at the chairman's charge only until 2013, when the tourning of the General Assembly would come.
In that order, you would like to see a expert and good manager who is not too related to football activities.
"I've already spoken to some people to whom I could take into account."
"For me, it was a crazy hearing some say that they wouldn't want to identify with the Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," adds.
The most promptly molest to Áglik at this point is the relationship of Pelta with the President of the Regional Futbol Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controverse past, known out of the world as a powerful lobbyist who is able to influence the votation of delegated in the General Assembly.
It is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential sillon.
"If you win, the state would be maintained and nothing in the football will change."
"By Berbra's support, a ambitional business man, the football will be even less profitable," said Êglik.
It also mentions the fact that the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a case of corruption, from which Pelta was impuned.
"I don't know what football prestigiation could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will EUFA and the FIFA look at us," he said, "that also takes care of its previous statement that "the Club Pilsen would come if Pelta became a president."
In the case of winning the elections of Thursday, the cooperation with Pelta could be established in the future.
The same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by the General Assembly of September, which has been completed in a feast.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one he would follow."
"It's very powerful."
"I could imagine it, for example, as a head of the representation."
"but not as a manager of a association."
"I don't even get the in there where I don't feel capable," he added, which in September was very careful for supporting the suspension of the Arbitr Commission presided by Ludek Macel, substituted by Dagmar Damkova.
It admits that it would be attractive to managing the association.
Return to its ability to manage private companies, since since the past summer, it is also the Pilsen Director, which, with its support, held the triunph in the first division in May.
"I have power to change some things in the football area and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some groups of pressure, which probably affect the decisions of the disciplinary and appropriation committee, producing disadvantaged employment, said:
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FACHR and the Czech Olympical Committee, with the help of which he had pressure on political leaders to deal with more money to the port of lottery taxes.
"This is one of the key problems to which the new President should be dedicated."
"If they increase the taxes on azars games, as the political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but they must tell us where they will stop all these money," he states.
Moreover, it doesn't take into account now if he has his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself is the President of the FAČR must be "not partial".
Pelta is at its time associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Praga.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see sense of ceder hypocritically my actions from the Pilsen Club to another person and then return there after a year and a half," he said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end with the dead point of elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to the Presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if it was chosen, the FACHR would ensure that the FACHR had new statutes that were definitively used to solve the conflicts in the future with regard to the electoral regulation.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about this Thursday in Nymburk, and he believes that the pre-electoral conflict could go to a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Before the elections not made in September, Pelta promised to be focused, if it was chosen, precisely on the representation and recovery of funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute at the last General Assembly, so this two-month placing could go well to defend and present its ideas on the management of the football in a larger context.
"The people of all levels are busy for football a long time ago and wait for this Thursday to meet the new President."
"They feel that the time has come to manage the association," thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, you think you have enough experience to manage the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current issues with elections is the Eufory that reigned at Ivan Hashek's time.
"Lamente, at the General Assembly of June, the statutes that were not as perfect as they all thought were approved."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used to win the delegated.
"If I choose the President, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer if this fails."
"It is a question of principles, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, don't get with your opposers.
In the past, I had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, who respects his training in the right, being aware that his opposite would also be his first president.
He had a long time ago without attacking Thomas Åhmik who, contrary to Pelta, didn't leave you with a head.
"It takes more than one year in the football world, and it has already achieved some success."
"Your attacks, but they were confused, and many were surprised by the electoral campaign."
"This is why many of them doubt about their true character," he said to his or her Lord Pelta, who remains faithful to the declarations announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, if he, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the top.
This last should be escaped from football promotion.
"In addition, I would like to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal of the past year."
"Only afterward, I would be involved in negotiations with the public sector and the private sector to ensure that there is enough money for all the football," the 46-year candidate said to the CTK two months ago.
Then he also promised that its nomination as the president of the football would not have any personal change in the model.
"I should first know the tasks of each employee," he repeatedly repeated Strahov where, after a long period of anarchie, it involves a comprehensive nervosism.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are passed before the next General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disappointment is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"The football needs credibility, which will be recovered only if he has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta is still optimist.
Rajchl promises that under her leadership, the FACHR would start working with wins.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current president Jindrich Rajchl is chosen as a new president of the Futbol Association of the Czech Association, many would certainly be sensitive.
Rajchl promises that if he is chosen, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsibility for each area of football.
It is also committed to solve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with the EUFA and the FIFA, get more money for the football and continue with the work started by former President Ivan Hashek.
"As the President, I'd like to dedicate me to the football."
"From international contacts with the EUFA and the FIFA to the selection, through professional football or high-effective young football training."
"I don't mean that I'd do everything alone," said Rajchl in an interview for the CHTK.
"I am a team player and I want to share the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member may be dedicated to a specific area."
"And I'll assign difficult tasks so that the football can, in each of these segments, continue with a lot of impulse."
"Most people will probably not like this, because it will mean to start working very hard and not only criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of critical atmosphere in football movement, it is said that it has been considered the possibility of not again to be presented as candidate.
"All know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will be a sense and that there will be no people behind me who will impide me and prevent me every step," he explained the reasons for their indecision.
"Mury people have told me I shouldn't be given for vengeance, because then they would be given for vengeance too."
"It's about to have faith so that you don't leave this, without any more," he said.
It also motivates you to continue the work that already begins with Hashek.
"In those two years, a large part of the work that I don't want to lose now."
"There are processes that have been started and that will have their effect within a few years and I would not like anyone to give them a father," he announced anxious that if they choose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again as before Hashek's time.
"I believe in the order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to keep.
"Before him, it's over all those people who would take care of the football to be only a privilege for some of the chosen ones."
"You can reproach me a lot of things, but not the fact that I am for someone."
"I'm trying to be a goal."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because just so all will feel well and not only the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also refuses the idea that only the President would be bohemic.
"Although some people do the opposite, I think I'm going to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one part of the Czech and another living, whose winners would go to the first division."
"The current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which represents a problem for young live players," Rajchl said.
Though at the fight of the presidential elections, Tomaš ։ The president of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl does not stop to believe in its opportunities to be chosen.
"I still feel to have a strong support of the Czech Federation, which has chosen me as its President and who knows that after me there are clear successes," Rajchl said, whose successes include the emergence of some decades of millions of disgusting contracts, the negotiations of television contracts and the negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he recognises his part of fault in which federalization is not united.
And while it is announced that Pelta is "descalified to restore confidence in the Czech football", it considers the other rival, ↑likk, as a strong candidate that has something to offer to the football.
"Nobody can refuse to do a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"If it is chosen, it will probably follow what Ivan Hashek already empees and would not significantly change the staff model in the committees."
"I don't want to use this for my favor," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
I'm going to go to
by Julia Stanek
Piscinas from an incredible, fantastic bathroom in Budapest: Whoever visits Europe can live his wonderful life at Â, and after a visit to the city or a road, relaxing his feet in burbuying bathrooms.
A book shows where the best welfare is located in the water.
When Iris Meder conducted a research travel during the last year and half, there was something that couldn't miss in his equipment, a banner.
He was stumbled over the water, looked at the cupulous art at the high, walked towards the angels of marmol, waiting for it at the border of the pool, and was amazed before the modernist pool restored meticulously.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his book at the time of all interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural history Meder exploded more than 200 bathrooms in this way and presented them in its recent book "Badefreuden": the pools in Munich, the historical bathroom palaces in the Black Selva, the "hormion constructions" in Taunus.
Realise’s "travel by the most extraordinary bathrooms of Central Europe" by 13 countries: Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year Germany is a real entusiasm of the bathroom culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to see with the deport, says Meder, only water is different.
Only the molester that the bathroomfriends must be complied with blues and chloride hedor, while the affairs to run can breathe the fascinant wheat of the boss of abeth or listen to the joyful trees of the birds in the park.
"Every day I wondered why the pools must always be so fashioned," this inhabitant of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The chapoteo in the pool and the oil oil of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pools is so large because all the senses seem to be treated, it is Meder.
And if the builder strikes, the pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of the ground, there is a surface of water in the bathrooms."
"The one part is transparent, the other part reflects the beautifulness of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: high bottles, color blues, trampolines.
The book with small graphics "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oases of the well-being, but, mainly, it is nice to hopp to a ։
Meder, the basin collector discovers the examples shown in its investigations in Hungary.
Along with the magnified medical bathrooms such as the Seychenyi bathroom of Budapest, 100 years old, waters with nitrates are located in a single carstical cavead (cave bags in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some terms, whose pools are of alcaline waters and are located in a building in a bottle form (Városi Termal supö in Yaszberény).
Many divergence pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While all the city places the eye in Zurich's tissue, you can look at Arlberb, snowerta, from the outer bathroom of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which the practice can be observed in the ski tracks.
The design, probably more extraordinary expects clients in Längenfeld: The water cathedral of Ötztal seems to look like a or ́ that just lands in the Alpes.
From three open sources, he ascends vapores in winter, while the mountains of Ötztal are finally raised up in heaven.
Alhambra in Black Selva
A Meder, the basin collector, did not invade chloride in all the pools.
Many terminal bathrooms sweet to sugar, in the bathrooms of Arar in Békescab, Hungary, the gasole pestilence is so strong that people think that they have reached a healthy bathroom.
It comes from the medical waters containing bicarbonate and alcali and whose skin we get to the skin when we enter the pool, a pleasure of the well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder also was deceived in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit pools and solar bathrooms in the Czech Bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he was found with a blocked territory.
The bathroom of the Duan Jurkovic architect was closed in 1902.
When Meder looked at 日 of the dismoroned windows of the red, white and yellow building, he saw the disease growing between the blue.
The responsibility was contrary to a pleasant pool in the Black Selva: the Termal Palacio in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three stages of building after themselves; not only neoromanic elements of their construction time can be discovered in 1844, if not also a Arab hall of Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since his amazed modernization in 1995, the Termal Palacio is the favorite bathroom of the basin collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Selva.
"He has much worth combination of different arquitectonical styles in such a fantastic unit," 日 Meder.
In such a palace, the impression in the term basin is apparently not much importance.
Agricultural Speculation
The Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of primary materials
By Christian Teevs
Is the Deutsche Bank rejecting his business with agricultural primary materials?
In the case of SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Joseph Ackermann has acquired a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the poor people of the world.
In January, the consortial head wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, it is a study, 84 per cent of Germans seems not acceptable to speculate with primary agricultural materials such as wheat or meat.
Two thirds of the questionnaires reject that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are removed from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of an investigation due to the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in the middle of October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the staff on global primary materials makes prices up, and the charges are charged with the responsibility of the world’s famine problem.
The consumer defense campaign is directed in particular to Joseph Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although the large Property such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, the premises on primary materials were thought to protect the traders from price oscilation.
The main experts agree that players have discovered the offers and requests and benefit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann repeated the critics in different way than competitors and assets: He promised to review the reckonings and said that no business "will be committed to the good fame of Deutsche Bank".
Information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group is revising the revisions of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Directive, together with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the guide will inform the consequences.
Finally, the business of primary materials could be reduced, or even their total abandon.
Ackermann's fixing his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but repeated its critics to the financial sector: "The growing food prices show specially drastic how the sprayed ones actually threaten public welfare."
Ackermann is located as the largest cabilder, especially in the obligations.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it plays the money for food prices," Bode advised.
"Even if Ackermann handles the subject of people who are hungry or the fame of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's inspection becomes exciting at first view, but it is clear that the consortian head wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before he leaves his position.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank published that the President of the Joint Directive would change something different from what was not planned in the Administrative Council.
With the abandonment of the controvertised agricultural speculation, it can perfection your image.
And it needs you only to take care of possible losses, and that will take care of your successor.
Two thirds would cancel investment in primary materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 international people have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, the Bode published the question for which the Forza Institute had asked 1.001 persons on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered legal that the Deutsche Bank offered investments in which the food prices were paid.
Many customers showed personal consequences when discovered that their share was involved in such businesses: if the question was, two thirds would cancel all investments from which money from the agricultural speculation.
43 per cent would disapproval a likely advice to his people, 49 per cent would ask, after reflecting, cancel his account and change to another institution.
Home 21 in Vienna
The Pavillon After Earth
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with highlights and a happy end, the pavilion of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 received premiums, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and dismourned.
Now it rebuilds as a house of exposures.
The architecture of modern postgerra passions, clear forms, cristal halls, strong curves and new building materials, typical thoughts about technical progress, so the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a suitable and known example.
The Swanzer Pabellon then obtained the Grand Architecture Price for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
Construction is too considered a contemporary hit of architecture.
He made the so known architect that also built the Austrian pavilion in the following universal exhibition.
With his legendary tower of four cylindres for MBW more the planned building in Munich, it has been internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions, rose after the universal exhibition in Schweizer Garten at the south station of Vienna, reformed in 1962 and inside a museum of the 20th century, was called "Home 20th".
The building was suitable but was missing spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to catch art or a good environment.
Despite this, it is used– until the modern art in Vienna had a new home.
The building is empty since 2001 and is decayed again.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the ball, now calling it "Home 21" and will be used in the future as a modern art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Belveder Museum, who belongs to the house, with the first exhibition, was a lot of happiness in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belveer gallery since 2007, reached a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in the history of the art with a significant career, among other things, patina’s artistic on ice at his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the founder director of the modern art Museum in Salzburg, performed reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private patrocinators and established its use.
In the context of the modern art, the works of the Fritz Wotruba escultor of the homosexual foundation are exposed, there should be a cafeteria and a library and also a building of offices.
Strength control, lower budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because Joseph Olbrichs' sequence was sensiblely reformed in Vienna, he expanded and adjudicated the concurrence, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna, and the pabell was for him a "important and great place", in which he intended "almost all weekend purposes" exposures.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its exchange of use with generosity and facility.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "a energy consumer", Krischanitz said.
The profile of the crystal box windows has been changed, a isolant cristal has been installed with glass fibre and the grid was replaced by a special security cristal.
The thermical pounds and steel pounds were strengthened or replaced, and the amiant tissues were rehabilitated.
Two sothans were used for the new use, a light panel descending between the house and the street provides ilumination, a pool serves to enter the nearly new building, but still the Swanzer pavilion.
Keep outside doors, the house is painted in old cooba tons and protected against oxidation.
And the movie room is exactly as it was before.
And all this with a strict control by the Office of monuments and a low budget.
"Too often he had to find material that was good, nice and liked to the Office of Protection of monuments," and warning about a aspere ground in the sothan.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and easily.
The bullet "the wine of Brussels" has been difficult, a little lately appealed to Krischanitz, a typical "apparition like" in the history of the city.
A architecture like this is "ever in the wrong place" and so he wanted to "wake up the appropriate conscience".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has occurred a fight of urbanistic happiness. The totally new and planned "boat of the central station", with residences and offices, is located at Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another happiness struggle: House 21 could receive a resort from another building of Krischanitz, because the Francesca von Habsburg Collectionist has bought the Berlinese Temporary Art Room and, as it is heard, negotiated with the city on a neighborhood place in Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that rises to millions
The company has imagined a crisis plan, which would avoid the winter trains' winds.
Duplicate the personal number.
What's costing millions.
In the fight against winter-related trains, Deutsche Bahn has been spent over 70 million euros in this year, it is a periodic report.
The "image" period reported, inviting an internal crisis plan of the group, of the investments planned up to 2005 of a total of EUR 300 million.
In order to achieve better performance of vehicles and railway networks with a long time.
Among other things, internal and external employees are planned to duplicate 16,000 posts to remove the snow from the ways and the andenes.
The goal is to take the snow and ice and 90 per cent of the needed hair for the work within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, announced on the trains too during this winter after a summary with the government and industry.
The past winter Deutsche Bahn suffered significant problems in the transport of travelers, since, among other things, he missed reservations against accidental ororological conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorisation of the iron federal office.
Moreover, there is a delay in the delivery of high speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn works for years in checking the high speed trends frequencyly on the taller, after a high speed train would suffer the rotation of a axis at the central station of Colonia.
The Deutsche Bank pays many millions in the United States.
After the tumult on President Joseph Ackerman, there appears a new problem of the United States, the Deutsche Bank must pay a million.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the United States to the Sektor's gigant, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement to end the contents due to five large credit cooperation during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypotechnical titles.
The NCUA financial market regulation re­duces many large funding partners with promises to buy financial products; the risks have minimised.
Such titles have lost their value during financial crisis and have drawn to depths.
"We are satisfied that we can declare the issue without that the parties have to join the courts," said a Deutsche Bank portfolio in New York.
The commitment does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of the NCUA, celebrated the difference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union holding (CUA) is responsible for United States credit cooperation and provides support in case of silence to protect customer investments.
NCUA reintegrate the losses of millions originated.
The currently closed agreements are its first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts for other large Propertys and in the summer to be counted against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of doubtful hypotechnical titles, the named values supported by hypoteques are addressed.
These are based on resident credits.
When the U.S. immobiliary bubble was broken in 2007, it led to many financial matters.
In September 2008, at the point of financial crisis, the investment and Property Lehman Brothers were disrupted.
Although the results have occurred a few years ago, it is currently a complicated wind for the people and the people.
Investors and inspectors have initiated incontable processes to receive recompenses or sanctify missing.
The Federal Resident Financing Agency (FHFA in its English centuries) has produced the largest number of requests.
Reply to the 18 major international responsibility that the two State hypotecary agencies and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been used from the hypoteque business in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank also has a request for the FHFA, which is for business by value of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "the substantive losses" without a precise number.
The Deutsche Bank 日 debts as infunded and explained that he wants to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes to 10 billion IBM
The Guru of Finances, Buffett, is strongly invested in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March, he has gained action for a value of more than 10 billion dollars.
Even now, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer or information technologies, since long-term development forecasts are negative.
But he read the IBM commercial report and changed its opinion on investment in the sector.
He had to understand much before IBM offers all services and searches for computer systems for the Departments of Technology Information of other companies.
In the financial world, a investment of Warren Buffett is considered a honor.
Therefore, the primacy of Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now shown in the CNBC economy holder who has bought IBM action for a value of $10.7 billion since March.
Your Berkshire Hathaway investment has gone to one of the largest IBM investors with a participation of 5,5 percent.
Buffett said IBM did not know anything about the commitment until now.
He identified the direction of the benefits of the economic crisis.
"They have done a great job," Buffett said on the strategy.
The IBM has already established the services of profitable information technology as the functioning of calculation centres.
The old informal piano for more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful teams for companies.
Buffett avoided technology companies until the date.
He said that he would only invest in companies whose business would understand.
In contrast, Buffett used the opportunity in a goods train, a supplier or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway has approximately 80 own branches, as well as part of all a series of large consorties such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Back.
Buffett, age 81, was charged by the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 60s and, with wise investment, spread it up to convert it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why it's an idol for unnumberable investors of all the world.
Your fast and infelix sense to win money has provided you the supername of "Omaha's oral".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's actions in the boss ascended one per cent.
"The gigant a ́", as IBM is known, has a value of more than 220 billion dollars and figures, together with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technological companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett, he doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish communications media doubt the German right state.
A periodic is talking about a "blood ideology" that is re-refreshing.
Eight-small business murderers have an extreme background between 2001 and 2006.
In Turkey and in the German origin of Turkish population, there has been fear and concern for this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a fantasm that was considered dead ago, since the attacks in the form of incendiums in Mõn in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 had no more effects of violence with extreme background against Turkish.
However, it has never been questioned that in Germany there is xenofobia.
The ultradirechist network shows a magnitude whose dimensions were not, or much less, pre.
"Will you react the blood ideology again?", titled the e - Internet of the Turkish "Haberturk" period.
The "Sabah" magazine highlights that one of the criminal authors was an informant of the Constitution's Federal Defence Office and is concerned that German authorities could be involved in the ultradirectist butt.
The Turkish community in Germany repeated sensiblely, at the end of the week, remembered the victims of racist violence with a monitoring before the Brandenburg Port.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn act of the fifty anniversary of the Turkish and German agreement.
The conviction was placed on a scene with joyful colors, as a story with a happy end.
The information came to some Turkish media as a bofetada: "The German gift for the fifteenth anniversary," says the title of a article in the Turkish "Haber X" Internet platform, repealing the murder chain background.
The German "Hürriyet" emission also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
"Beginning bad olive," says the title of the Ahmet Külahci column.
Highlights that murderers were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to their work to the rebuilding of Germany.
In the fores of Germans of Turkish prosecution, the behavior of the police and its success in the search forwards are very critically discussed.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not sought so much as soon as they were suspicious in the ultra degree.
Some are shown as less retoric about the media drastics: "From now, the immigrants are lost, they are not left more than self-defense and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany is strongly depending on the quality of the declaration and the adjustment of the sanction to the whole network.", writes "Selen".
What means that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, Mõn and Solingen attitudes will be declared in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Incendie of Solingen has been made in German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed clearer to the Turks who live here that there is a concrete threat and to the Germans that unconfiance and distantness can disappoint violence.
The attacks aggravate the feeling of a group of the Turkish party.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, then, the deficiency of German policy after attacks was criticized, Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mõn.
After the attention in the form of incendium of Solingen, he sent a telegram to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, replaced it in Colonia's funeral.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated is the amount of its taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media is again to show the depth that since then is the defiance of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broadly explaining and revaluation of extreme terrorism in Germany, this time there are no French words.
The scenario of the Zurich Lake
Europe's most risked ability is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
UBS has almost entered the financial crisis, and since then it has come from a crisis to the next.
Now leads a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought so.
After its spectacular breakdown of the federal summary, in July, it was known that it would begin in 2013 in a new and almost even a spectacular work: President of the Administrative Advisory Council of the Great Year, UBS, an unexpected and profitable step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, Swiss praise for its beautifulness and UBS for its recently acquisition of solidity and lets friendly observations fall on its future companions.
"The USB has achieved a revitalisation."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it was clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial USB operator in London avoided all the security systems and destroyed EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, the USB General Director, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to arrive.
The President of the Administrative Advice of the USB has been considered also topiced since then, and everyone asked: What comes Axel Weber?
Weber had to advise the advice since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Administrative Council will be held in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the Monday reported.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
It is not banking, rather, economic and adviser teacher, and it has certainly been necessary for an adjustment period.
The fight is made responsible for a strategy, which just came to try again that it deserves the title "the greatest part of the European scandal" since a long time.
On the other hand, the USB is large, even a short time ago was the biggest administrator of the world's goods, and, on the other hand, since years ago, it was dismissed from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, so it seems, it's so proud to the prospect of hisself.
Eat the financial crisis.
The USB had a great fame until 2007.
The image of the administrator of goods was discreet and solid, but also mad, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a great number of investments.
On the one hand, with 1.6 billion dollars, the USB manages more money from addicted customers than any other part of the world.
And, on the other hand, they were like investment in the liaison of the biggest world.
That's impressionant.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later Professor in Zurich for many years, explains: "And my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good hold."
"From the current point of view, one asks: How could he wrong me?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, something came very bad in the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general director, who was even considered a genial and very smart banker, was excitedly released.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The investment fund was shiped in losses with high risk titles and had to amortize thousands of millions.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this, he found investors, of course, that some would look with disappointment too short before: a Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and a Arabic state fund, so discreet, that he had never heard his name.
This was just the first shot.
In April 2008, he started.
It had to declare the loss of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, president of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative advice of Switzerland.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued in view of its wrong investment, the UBS was found in the financial crisis before the cheap and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Action bought UBS difficult values for many thousands of millions, and the Helvetic Conference gave six billion francs for a mandatoryly convertible good through which it became co-proportionary.
All Switzerland was affected, the dramatic thing this was for a small country, if it is so large.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic results of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't rescue UBS again," said Geiger, expert in Âa.
At the first catastrophe the second was joined.
A few months later, the UBS captured a tax conflict with America and was ready to deliver the data of the customers added, which may have distorted taxes with the aid of the payment.
Furthermore, it approved a number of $780 billion, a refund of unjustified benefits from these businesses with a payment.
The UBS therefore admitted more or less aid in the fiscal fraud.
Simultaneously, he lost something that has been his capital since ever in competition by rich customers: the aureo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the secrets of its own is no longer the same.
This followed the issue of the President of the Joint Directive and of the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exhibition of the customers' funds.
In this way, in a few months, the Property lost his credibility in its two central sectors: in investment by wrong speculations and the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
And just when I was going back to be something more quiet, just when I thought UBS was going to get it again, this disgusting story of the operator, a individual operator defrauded 1,7 billion euros before the UBS was noticed that something was wrong.
And, of course, this has not yet worked well with risk management in investment.
"The case of Adoboli is shown that risk controls have changed too little," ­ Martin Janssen, Professor of Economy and Finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The Financial Director of a Great German is also safe: "The problem of UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
Thus the idea of the care, with which bankers have been present since a while, to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no too large risk, however, money security wants to break on the other side of the Alpine Republic.
The security depths of theirs were the symbol of inquebrantable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The UBS center in Zurich doesn't involve the cliche of the private solidity of its, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
It has its main seat on the Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes from the main station right to Zurich Lake, marched by the Swiss mountains of snow.
Here the buildings are obstinate, the winners are one of Europe's highest.
Here are joyers like Tiffany's between traditional businesses such as Sprüngli's confiteria.
Here they live for years: from the national, passed through the Credit Suisse palace, up to the privates such as Julius Bär.
It enters the UBS receipt room through a heavy giratory door.
Inside the walls are covered by marmol, in front of large skin sillions, at the logo, there is a large letter to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: Security.
The two big Propertys, UBS and Credit Switzerland, have at some time moved the idea of the great Property of their, or have delivered it, as the President of a small privacy of her.
It prefers not to read its name in the magazine, finally and at the end, as all bankers do, too, with both major businesses.
UBS has been made too large, thinking, mainly in the investment, where the Anglossians have gained land.
There's nothing else to say.
"And they have been used for a long time to the habits of the English."
In fact, UBS changed the investment in Anglosajone, granted its first great profit and then the disaster came, no European financial employment had lost both money in the high risk jungle and great risk.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"This Wednesday the governmental coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of his nation," wrote the author Luc Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" (The UBS crash) in Spanish.
The politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to rescue the large range of the road.
How's it happening to them?
The bankers are talking to their own bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Propertys of their owns were joined in a powerful consortium.
It comes too large for the small Switzerland, and it is still growing.
So it served to supplement the two different pioneers of the UBS: a rich but sleeping with the centre of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer and stronger internationalization.
Straightway, internationalized investment facility reached with a lot of money, with which they could make a large financial bicycle round.
There are two names related to this UBS submission: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative advice.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says the expert in Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modesty, that understands many models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that has been able to open the step from the Propertyization to the top."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive error: "He thought that his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, the destiny came before the case.
UBS employees are clearly agreed with the directive meetings, where Wuffli, the consortial head, always repeated the same lemma: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American Property was the most powerful investment in the world.
The "League Tables" included the classifications that then documented the success of the stakeholders.
UBS wanted to be on the cover.
Some steps went out well.
Division operations and action negotiations were at the highest.
However, the responsibility of business advisers made a weak point: In the international interest business, in the "fixed income" language, there is a great refund for the major.
UBS is empty in American hypotecary products.
To fill these empty ones, UBS eats an aventure that almost cares about its existence.
Increasing reasons, both the same and one of their high risk funds created in high risk investment.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold American hypotecharious credits and then sell them, maintaining certain risks on account.
And also, like others, he searched for a long time.
"In summer 2007, as the American immobiliary market was in calls, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, expert.
So big Euforia, so deep falls.
A manager had to go, because the trial of order was more complicated than they expected.
The posts in the UBS have become projective seats and are unsecure until now.
Currently, whoever leads a great ability has a almost impossible job.
Finds a strategy for a person, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, expert in them, has a idea, ending the investment, focusing on the administration of goods, returning to the Swiss roots.
It doesn't want to come so far (always).
But the investment must reduce much, it is clear now.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the House, will present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only considered in the Italian-su- 51 years as a transitional solution, since the Property was overwhelmingly separated from its former Grübel.
However, he was impused: a permanent direction of the UBS business, the Zurich's office reported on Thursday.
Ermotti wants to invest in its state at the middle of the nineteen.
Remove 3.500 places.
But this isn't enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's it?
What do you want to win money?
These are the questions that sure Axel Weber is now.
Until the moment, he just says he'll first look for a living with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

Intelligent degrees spread in cities
In many places, the degrees are considered "problematic": these intellectual animals from the cities are not expelled for a long time, experts.
Some of them like, others want to be quickly released from them, the degrees belong to the image of the city since years, but in many municipalities, the neighbors' kiss are accumulated by the darkness and the sound of animals.
Although there has not been any means against the "problematics" until now.
The degrees are no longer out of the towns, experts in the first symposium on degrees in Leer, East Frisia.
There the experts of all the national territory discuss the possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in towns
Propertyologists attribute cities' problems to the field of certain protected levels; chemical applications in agriculture end up with traditional vital spaces.
The feast, the growing building and the fall of trees that host them difficult the lives of the birds.
The degrees are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 players in Soest, Westfalia, among others, northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, the negative tickets of the press were thrown into a controvertised project to kill the degrees of the degrees.
Criticals have qualified the caze of animals through traps for birds and murder with hairs as especially brutal.
"Expuls and ahuyent them normally nothing is obtained" showed Werner Klöver, the urbanist and the landscape of Leer.
Disparing with water to the nids or drawing the trees seems to be unnecessary consequences, also Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert in Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals disappear, the large colonies divide and distribute in other places."
Ahuyen's only imaginable as hospitals, residences of elderly or college.
"We should live with them, we don't get them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, Wolfgang Kellner, Leer's headquarters.
A combination of hailing animals in sensitive and tissue areas is possible to return to sitting in other places.
"Informative panels instead of chain-shirts" Uta Maria Jürgen, psychology and etnology makes publicity against the purpose of treating animals in a completely different way: "The best is that we can endure a pit on the face with aplome."
Jürgens co-funded the learning circuit in Schleswig-Holstein on Ascheberger's degrees, where letters report about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by the tourists.
Jürgen also has its own opinion on critics by the sound of the birds: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
The intellectual and ability of these animals are legitimate, the grass use not only the resources for swimming boats, unless they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, the Ethologists of the University of Cambria checked in four degrees to where the intellectuality of the birds comes.
In a experiment, the birds had to quickly let a stone fall on a platform to reach a polyal larva.
Without much training, they determined the size and the way it should have the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, gradual astutes had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers put a little cube with a polyal larve in a vertical cycle.
The birds couldn't come to their pigs.
But the researchers left them a piece of lamp.
With which the four animals made a bathroom, with which they fished the cow in the tube treader.
Three of the four degrees were achieved in the first trial.

Personal Masacre
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, the beautifulness and pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "starts with a long dramatic person of the guy who can make a man fall the soul to his feet.
Here are some action advice: Run this page quietly and convert it into your page mark.
It will come to know these people very well in the news of Mr. Englund's newspaper, and this dramatic person will work as its GPS, a faro during those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, he is confused and departed in the war's cloud.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Aämmia, which grants the Nobel Price of Literature.
What you have written here is a little running book, which definitely describes as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important or famous battles; almost no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions on tactics or materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about " feelings, impressions, experiences and status of humor".
"The beauty and pain of the battle "combines experiences in wartimes of more than 20 men and women, both sides of the war, from college and botanics to scalers, doctors, ambulance and administration drivers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become war prisoners, or their members, they will become foolish or die.
Their lives parpaded here as voting wings in a church; some news are added to the mixture while others disappear.
The book of Mr. Englund is a deviation of the standard history books.
It is also a corrective idea that the First World War was only the funeral of trinchers in the west front.
The "beauty and pain of the battle" moves in a expert way to other war teatres: the Alpes, the Balkans, the east front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the colmens; one passes the Christmas in Egypt under the piramides; the tse-tse muscles are an intratable problem.
This is a conveying book, almost since the beginning.
The war inunds the lives of these people as a natural disaster, an Uragan Katrina, who deceives the court.
When the fire of artillery is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's home with your children, are you staying or running?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, nor if you're going to fight this war.
"Carence of facts," Mr. Englund notes, "he has been filled with conjections, suggestions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of conspiration, dreams, weights and sounds."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a English farmer in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German mariner of the high sea float.
His stories have been obtained in most of their memories, letters and other materials already published earlier.
The explanations of your lives may be terrified or conmove, but they are more full of life in the compulsion of small moments, lost details than Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privacy and prepare them with what is there.
About accounting the story of a German college says, "Sucedanes, everywhere."
"Sucedane it of coffee, aluminium, imitation gome, paper sales, wood buttons."
He continues to talk about the food that occurs in Germany.
Describes "meat made from coated and printed in sheep grass (and finished with a bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and sucked patate pellets; bottles with wood sockets".
Hay, note, "837 meat substances allowed in the production of salt, 511 registered coffee substances".
Some stories are about honor and value.
A American recognises his own impulse to salvage and shows about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are designed and not to sit in sillons with a cigarette and a whisky, the journal of the evening or a best seller, and wishing that that this babysitter means civilization and that there is no barbar behind that shaded and tisssued sin."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will hear or import him.
"When one rejects the thought of sacrifice, one would like to think that it could happen before the public," writes.
Instead, it is horriblely like "a condamnation being stumbled in secret".
Other comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become more economic competition," wrote Mr. Englund, "a war between factors."
Reflect on the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young animal of the century: the murderer in eloquent and ideologically convinced mass with good confession clothes that executes his charnicy while he is sitting behind a desktop".
People behave in invisible ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively took a venerous disease of prostitutes as a way to avoid the service in front.
"The largest expression of this can be seen the trade of pool gonocotic, which soldiers buy and embarrass with that their genitals with the hope of finishing in the hospital," writes.
"They who are really unexpected strike it on their eyes, which often gives place to a blind of life."
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose, but not extravagant, it is perfectly adapted to its human task.
In thousands of small scenes, war reflects the way to "decent forces andptionally incontrolable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate".
People begin to ask why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about the First World War often have been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or newsles like No newness in front of Erich María Note, instead of complete stories.
Mr. Englund's volume is one to a little conventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating ends that I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I'm not gonna reveal it.
But it's like he'd come from his book, thrown from among your fingers that page of dramatics persone, and would have burned it with a grill.
After a previous step, a planned attack per minute
Centuries of police agents were involucrated, some of them carrying antidisturbing cases.
The Monday night was selected on Tuesday because the Zuccotti park would be most empty.
The operation remained secretly except for a few high-range officers, initially saying to the others who were joining an exercise.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the centre, his presence underlined how the operation was injured for the police department.
The recent week-end episodes could not be repeated, such as the pulverization of pimpy spay on demonstrants, infringing the department's standards and creating a public sympathy storm towards the "occupations".
And therefore, the police operation to discover the Zuccotti park of manifestants was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Agencies had been prepared to see how employment was developed in other cities.
A larger catastrophe simulation was going on in Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
Agencies increased the vocational training of destructions - contractual measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the side of Manhattan from the East River.
The orders to enter the park came in the "the last minute", said someone known to the orders, which were rejected to the mission only as "a exercise".
"To the few police I know they were called for this, they didn't tell them that it was to enter the Zuccotti park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they would enter the Zuccotti park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secretism was a lesson from the city.
On 14 October, some agents wanted to discover the park, but they rejected when hundreds of demonstrants came before the time after they heard about the plans.
Wednesday operation involved agencies of several police units, including special forces of all the municipality - tens of mobile agents who were usually inunding the barriers with high crime.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel every day to work, were going and coming from the park during the day, doing a good time to enter.
"It was close to do it when it was the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Camions of the Energy Service Unit with focus and highlights were gathered in the Pike Slip Cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan's pool, before exiting.
The lights and pre-grabed messages that retraced from the highlights seemed to intimid many manifestants.
The Community business agents were at the park with their courts clearly, many manifestants simply collected their things and went away.
No tent was touched until 1:45 p.m., the police said, giving time to demonstrants to collect their belongings.
Other agent teams were seen meetings in the perimeter to enter if they needed to be arrested in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, head of the Department of Police, said it was for his security.
But many journalists said that he was trying to avoid the police to come into the park, and that they had been brokenly treated by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units at Church Street, along the west border of the park, could catch images.
As the police moved towards the West to the tenant of the personal effects of the manifestants, including paper and plastic bags, the teams of the Department of Limpies followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrants who refused to move were arrested outside, presenting pictures on the Internet shortly later.
A central group of manifestants took positions near the cook area of the camp, near the centre of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
In turn, about 10 people in the camp's epicenter fell between them through their arms.
And two people fell on trees, Mr. Kelly said.
The agents of the emergency service were called to cut the candidates.
There were no arrests in the park until at 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The opening operation was complete about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were by "variation of the public order and resistance to the authority," he said.
The highest rango agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the higher uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of department detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "he was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited on the east side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty and Cedar, if they had to enter.
They arose barricad on the Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on the Pine Street, a block southward.
From those positions, he was seen to the police by expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti park.
At a given moment, a series of agents, many of them with scrolls, were seen by shopping people outside.
There were about 28 people in the north perimeter.
Some of the loudest acts of the evening took place on the south of the park.
In return to the 5st, south of the Pine street, a manifester hopped on the head of a police car, and others were seen to remove the air from the roads of a police car.
At a given moment, a piece of strip was flying from the multitud.
Finally, a agent and a manifestant were hospitalized.
The support worker's office will request the city for emergency
The officer representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to request the city on mid-day, claiming that discounts were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools that are involved in poor students.
The request is, possibly, the latest weapon available to the municipality, 37, in its efforts to revoke disappointments.
Seven hundred and two assistants in the school, parents and other employees who were among the worst payed in the city lost their work on 7 October, in a movement that the sindical leaders described as a political vengeance for their negative failure to allow, in the past, the access of the city to a healthy assistance fund to work groups to close their budgetary breakdown.
The municipal authorities have categoryally refused that accusation.
In a audience in the Assembly last month, the Education Advisor, Dennis Mr Walcott, said that the disappointments were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council agreed to tell him that nothing in the budget indicated that the members of the school support staff would be dismissed.
Functionaries of the municipality 37 said that they submitted the written claim by warning to the Department of Education that it would be requested. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the request at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The request will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as accused, and with eight dismissed employees, all of them black or latin women, as well as the majority of those who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, leader of the Legal Department of the City, said that the city had not seen the request and thus could not make comments on its specific claims.
The New York Times is a dealer of the request received, the officer has been focused on the number of discounts in the poor areas of the city to support an injust treatment claim, saying that poor schools have lost more assistance, since they have been insufficiently subvented in chronic form.
It is noted that although there were no exhibitions in Staten Island and a few schools at the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23th district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were lost in the 8 and 9th districts of Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistant employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the question says, "This is not a barrier of addicted parents who can recover funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The budget of the 36th budget was reduced to 3,26 per cent this year, and he also lost money when the city changed the way the additional financing for each poor student's registration in schools.
The Syndicat also that secondary school directors may have been engaged by the language in a memorandum that allows the exhibition of parents' coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excedent" to describe the action, although "excedent" most often describes the act of transfer to a nominal teacher of a school to a workboat, whose sales are paid by the central office.
"Seventeen and six coordinators of parents have been dispedited," says the box removing, "and not only in the dead."
End mission, the Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
Finally, republican and democratic in the Capitole are ready to agree on something related to the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was that rebellion was successful, that the veteran dictator Muamar the Gadafi was captured and killed and the participation of the United States reached its end.
On Wednesday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate will consider a resolution, patrocinated by President John Kerry (democrated by Massachusetts), together with Senators John McCain (republican by Arõna) and Joseph I. Lieberman (depending from Connecticut), by plauding the libios for its successful rebellion and the United States groups for his "valence".
"This resolution is to honor the courageous in Libya, starting to rebuild its country," said Kerry.
"This is a bipartid support for its democratic aspirations."
The language may seem inofensial, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy until now.
This summer, both parties' legislators were fighting between themselves and the White House on the editing of a series of resolutions to approve or acquire the role of the United States military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The draft law was destroyed in the Camera by a wide bipartid margin, which never came to vote in the Senate.
However, on the same day the draft law was `zased in the Camera, the camera would also be a measure that would have covered the funds for operations and operations in Libya.
That left the United States mission in a kind of legislative cleaning - with the Congress, I was very painful enough to criticize the management of Obama of the mission, but not so wounded as to actually follow herb under her feet.
The Congress's indecision was then overcome by the action.
Thripoli fell in the hands of the libios rebels in August, and Gadafi was murdered on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on External Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for its great courage and extraordinary resistance to be released to themselves" and "Elogia to men and women of the United States Armed Forces and to their partners of coalition that participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary valency and professionality."
The resolution also "declares the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure achieve the full support of the Committee on External Affairs, or will it share the legislators as the draft Legal of June?
The last version was made by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the main republican of the Committee.
The Porter of Logar said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law project.
On the other hand of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment by equilibred budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republican congressors and some democrats.
The measure, patrocinated by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the Camera or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded until now to make their amendments to the assembly, but not for the lack of intentions.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments introduced to this Congress, which include a broad range of themes.
Some are duplicated - the same draft law is proposed both in the Camera and in the Senate - and others with light variables between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of budget balance only in the Camera, and another claimed that "the Federal expenditure will be controlled."
Some of these law projects are also identical, but they give their patrocinators - especially all new republicians who seek to refine their curriculums - the opportunity to jactify that they were the "emergency" of that measure.
The budgetary control law, which was approved in August, requested that both the House and the Senate vote for a amendment to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 Senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Besides the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of the Congress can comply, while the representative José E. Serrano (democrated by New York), wants to remove the limit of two mandates for the Presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (democrated by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
A amendment that prohibits homosexual marriage is a permanent proposal, as well as a prohibition of the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are ≥ 2/3 of the states.
So entusiasmful that members have been at the time of proposing amendments, they are not moved to a faster time than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and presented 66 in 110th.
The ritme is unacceptable in comparison with the 1990 decade, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments each two years, the numbers provided by the Senate Library are provided.
But they did not have much more success then than they had now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th was in 1992, but actually was proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Golped but not wounded," Giffords talks in their first television interview from the tiroteo
Ten months after a gunman shot him to burn in a constituent act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrated by Arõna) appeared at the national television the night of the Monday, sang with Broadway's melodie "The sun will go tomorrow" and said he wanted to return to the Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fighted to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The programme documented its difficult way of return of damage caused by a ball that fractured her crane and perforated the outside of his brain, and that it passed from front to back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned for surprise to the Camera to issue its triunfant vote in the agreement of the debt debt.
In his first television interview since January Thirote, who killed six and killed 13, Giffords laughed, rided and sing - and described his recovery as "difficulty".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41 years old, answered, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronauta Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" of a time of duration, which was issued by the viper of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope".
The special programme analysed Giffords' recovery since January 8th.
In videos by Kelly in the first weeks, it is seen in her hospital bed, with a stuck head and a long cicatriz through her front.
She can only keep one or two heavy fingers while her husband's soul.
More months later, he looks at Giffords sitting on a wheel shelter while the therapeutes tell him how to make simple actions.
A head move.
A frozenship of the people.
And then his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "tostada", a request for change in his breakdown menu.
Videos distributed by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords recovery: It looks at the congressist sing together with the therapeutes the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" of Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who was two hours ago every day, said he didn't react on the day of the tiroteo.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords a article of the magazine on murder of 12 March when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the accident.
The suspicious gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is arrested in a Missouri prison and is medical while waiting for judgment.
"Man people died," Giffords said to Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a moment of her wife's recovery she said, "I've been destroyed."
"So, I said to her, 'Gabby, you haven't been destroyed,' said Kelly.
"You've just been shot.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're gonna get back and you're going back with more power than ever."
The groups do feel more harmful than I respect
The event was a Wall Street wallet that recovered millions of dollars for veterinarians without home in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ball on impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, mariners, aviators, and marine flights struck in their posts in return to him.
The tag multitude stood up and plagued.
"The men and women were viewed as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the recovery of premium funds.
A military officer of high rango in the gala, also known as the President of the Major State, the Major State, Mike Mullen, saw the role of the groups in different ways.
"They showed them as a kind of orphan child," wrote the officer in a email.
I am sure the organizations had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The impressions markedly contradictory illustrate the difficult relationship of military and a public and often remotely, sometimes, worshipper.
It is proud to the troops with elogies for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, they say the members of the service.
The public acts more as if they give you those uniforms.
"We are not absolutely victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put us in the role of decompared masses."
The subject is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, which does not want to look ungrateful or unappreciated with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath to which the groups returned in the last years of Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on the lamentation are running in silence and in private between war veterinarians.
After his two sons returned to fight with Marina's Infancy, Mark Cancian retreated coronel warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because the insurgents had been made and traveled to exotic places.
Others would ask if there would be a "injured and violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who came to Iraq and returned to a high-level government work in Washington.
He felt that some interviewers had asked him softly if it would be able to endure under the pressure of a needed work in Washington immediately after his fighting tour.
"When you talk about your service you need to face negative impressions," Cancian reminded her children.
The military concern, in part, comes from the indiference and to wars.
The achievements in the battle field are rarely chosen for praise by a country who has a little family with the military and see a few direct benefits from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
"We, as a nation, have no longer valued the military heroism of ways that were common in the Second World War," said the general lawyer David Barno, who commanded the United States troops in Afghanistan.
However, politician and public elogies are highly focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognised by the number of tours they have supported, the number of friends who have lost or the reach of their lesions.
The army faces a growing pressure to end the violation
This week, a historical audience will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their sustained passion before violation.
If not, hundreds of applicants are organizing for the next.
The first Elizabeth Lyman soldier was 25 years old and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night she said he was violated by a companion.
It was October 2008, and he was headed back to his quarter in the Air Air Base Miramar, north of San Diego, after the dinner with a friend when he met with a colleague who had a 12-sided beer package.
He asked her if she could join her in her room to take a cup.
"It was a signal of alarm," says Lyman.
However, Texas' native left his concern on one side.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's of Texas," he says.
"I would have heard my instincts."
In a few minutes to enter Lyman's room, the man approached him behind, took it down and violated it, he added.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and ancient military staff expected an intentionally a judicial decision in a historical judgment that will be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the request they have interviewed against the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his pre-secretaries, Donald Rumsfeld, will be judged.
The request states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce generalized violation between military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, presented by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, D.C., the request was initially involved in 17 applicants, but he grew up to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them have been violated or accused by their companions, and that the army failed at the time of investigating, processing, or providing appropriate justice after the suggested aggressions.
Burke says he's going through the largest army plan, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a ≥ upward down," he says.
"Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of repressals? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, they have been contacted with her about 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future requests.
His strategy: Rather than compulsing all the applicants in this case, putting all eggs in the same box, so it will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Team for the Defense Department, headed by the Federal Tax Neil MacBride, has presented an invitation to disapproval the case.
The Court's documents, received by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy - in essence that military people cannot be requested by current or old soldiers by lesions suffered in armed forces.
By a judgment of the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the staff in active service.
"The eligible damages are part of the military service of the applicants," the documents say.
The Defense Department refused to make comments for this article.
The things have changed since the 50s.
While women are still officially serving in battle, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
Similarly in Iraq and in Afghanistan, military women's teams are playing more important roles, especially to reach local women in war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers have died and two thirds of them in fighting.
It's time for the army too to modernise, says Burke.
She is not alone in her fight, and three other requests are going, besides her.
In the Yale Rights Faculty, the Clinics of Justice for Veterinans is preparing a case against the four main military ́s for the promotion of a misgical environment.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a request against the military that is focused on the diagnostics of "personality disaster" assigned to violation victims in order to give them the highest of the service - a common event, the activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a group of human rights.
His group presented a request in December against the employment of Veterans, accused of discriminatory practices in the way it handles the benefit claims for those who say have been sexually accepted in the service.
Nine legislative projects have been submitted separately at the Congress by a bipartid mixture of senators and representatives, offering a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3 158 denunciated sexual attacks, the Office for the Prevention of the Sexual Agreement and Reply to the Defense Department.
However, the aggressions are note subdeclared , and by its own estimates of Pentagon , which numbers at approximately 13,5 per cent of the 19,000 estimated incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the processing procedures: In 2010, 20 per cent of the cases claimed in the army were judged - half of the civil justice system.
The applicants in Burke, described their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma.
In the case of Lyman, he denied the presumptuous violation to the military police less than one hour after it had happened.
That night, he said, he was asked to tell the details of his violation 11 times different from a multitude of police, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to a kit of violation, and the blood of her aggressor - of a court in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which he was asked about having sexual relations with her boy on the day of the attack.
Six people declared personality witnesses in the name of the author, which was finally absuelt.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work-- I found me crying from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember that I said to my officer, "It wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally had a deterioration of personality, which did not appreciate her for the service.
In January 2010 it was distributed from the service under less than honorable terms, which prevents you from receiving any benefit.
As regards whether the case presented by Lyman and his companions of request continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Rights in the Faculty of George Washington.
However, he said, "In my opinion, they should be able to continue."
What is involved between them and a verdict is this teaching that has been criticized since it was published for the first time.
I've been a permanent critic of the Doctrine Feres.
The army is dead behind because it does not have the same invove and disobey that is responsible.
And adds, "The probabilities are strong against them... but it's important for them."
These things only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the audience doesn't go on his way, Burke, lawyer of the applicants, he'll put his other hundreds of applicants in future cases.
"We will continue to fight armies in this matter until the reform occurs," he says.
"Or until we die, what happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before converting to the new face of the extreme in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another type that aired its anti-immigration points online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted that he had committed a murder in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, was to his first public audience.
While Breivik could have acted alone, he was far from being alone in the ciber space: he had passed most of the time he had predicted his attack before his computer, talking with some of the millions of nationalists who support social network groups.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can you find them?
Easy - you just have to enter Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report published on the European Digital Populism by the British Study Centre DEMOS.
The Facebook personal information allocation is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the publicity tool to determine their demographic characteristics desired with a cientical precision - the way the sellers have been used for years.
The Bartlett team found a half million fans of the groups of fans throughout Europe and then addressed announcements, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the announcements invited users to complete an investigation that he asked about their educational level, violence and optimism on their own future.
When reaching Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 100,000 followers of 14 extent party in 11 European countries - all without exit from the office.
"It's a completely new way to make a research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not of all overwhelming: Online partners of the groups of debts are tending to be young, men and hungry by immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "they who combine their online activism with outline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen."
The DEMOS work is just one example of how Facebook is being converted into a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in "I like", messages in walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding a average of three parts of content per day, the "data supernova" of Facebook is generating a growth of research, impulsing the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beautifulness is that you can study people to whom you couldn't draw close to a folder on the street.
"Before, when you asked people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, and they would never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook removes all that - you're going to them right."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address social health problems.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno from the Wisconsin-Madison University and its colleagues found that university students who talked about their drinking hazards on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having problems with drinking than the students who remained silently on the subject.
Moreno suggests that students, such as resident advisers, can control the site and intervene to help a student who has too much status updates with their drinkers.
"You can't cope with a problem if you can't," said Dimitri Christakis, the co---resident of Moreno and Director of the Health Centre, Behavior and Development of the Child in the Infantil Research Institute of Seattle, said the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children in risk that otherwise would not be able."
Facebook is also constantly "pinching" to his own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and the Day of San Valentine, the electoral participation expectation half the 2010 legislation period, and a national happiness (principally using the information that can be used - digital freedom defenders long ago that the site should provide its large quantity of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, please or not - the sacrifice to play Scrabble with a friend at thousands of kilometres away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users are being part of a question that does not know?
While researchers have directly defined well-defined information about how to collect their data out of line, online is a free bar for all.
"I don't think many of the users have thought if a researcher could have examined his profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Londres Family Laboratorium, about a study of 2006 that has been conducted with Facebook public walls of students.
"In what they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then it's the question of the methodology.
Even out of line, there is no guarantee that a research subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information of a user's profile and of the messages of the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do out of Facebook are two things fully different," Selwyn says.
That is why, despite its years as a researcher of the technology, Selwyn believes that a subjectcape and a boligraph are still the best research tools that no one can use.
"There is no subject to enter the real world and talk to the real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social are still going out."
"Free and unhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes its first public appearance in the court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has been described to himself as a fighter of "residence" during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the movement of Norwegian Resistence and in the Templates of Norway," he said before a full room with 500 people.
"I'm opposed to the court, since he received the mandate of organizations supporting hatred's ideology and because it supported multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I don't declare my fault."
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologist, because "He didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express its viewpoints."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought an ancient discourse, to address the family of his victims to the end of the audience.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik under preservation for 12 weeks, access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities should have a strict control on all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and families of victims attended the audience.
Some came with the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that it is reclused under the key.
All attended the aim of progressing to the conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and unhuman," said a superman of Utoya to the Norwegian NRK.
"I was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and listening to the suspicious."
Being clothed with a dark and covering tragedy to Â, Breivik remained calm and professional during the audience and looked at the journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and went out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a great "resistence" movement, the judge decided that it was not a mental act, and said that there were no evidence that he acted with complices.
Some may advise that the attacks of 22 July seem to be a work of an extremist instead of a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically disturb the pain and confusion that a nation still feels.
"I would like to look like a monster, but it doesn't seem," said a family of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it looked like it."
7 Lections of Steve Jobs' lost interview, shown in a teatro this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some compared to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology like the Great Moderno Inventor.
But what Apple's fans could find more discovery, in a recent interview of Jobs' networks, which has been decompressed as a series of special projections on the largest markets this week, it is how much this creative mind was understanding about the commercial and the work flows of the products.
It was certainly a designer, dreamer and authorised hyppie, but he was also a medical organizer and a unki of the flow diagrams - a man who thought that many executives suffered "a illness that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a great number of work between a great idea and a large product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triumph of the idiots) on the arrows of the personal computer, and he seated over one hour with Jobs for a rare and rare conversation.
At that moment, they had spent shortly 10 years since Jobs had been committed to go out of Apple, and he had already worked intensely in his new NeXT informatic company, waiting for the popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview is used in Nerds, he said that the originals of the interview disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete copy in VHS was found in the director's garage.
This file material, quite redistributed, is the base of Steve Jobs: The lost interview, from 68 minutes, which comes to the Landmark cines this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating interviews in depth, Jobs here seems amazingly ready to expose their technological and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly suspecting their thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to Cringely's questions, enable you to go faster to the themes or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before Pixar's age, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophecy in the lost interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of the informatics.
One thing is reading postume evaluations from Jobs' career, but there is something cruel and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer at the border of the size.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not much after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of the lost interview:
About how it was to carry out a business:
"For the years in the business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" And the answers that give you inappropriately are, "Oh, that's just the way you're doing."
No one knows why he does what he does, no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify Apple accountability.
Unconcerted in the way the costs were registered - often starting with a "standard cost" which was made in the eye of good cover, and then fitting with a "employable" - developed an automaticized factory that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs to the detail.
About Daddy's broma:
Jobs tells the "Caja A" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hake the telephone company effectively and to make calls for a long distance free.
It has been widely written about the device, but the Jobs' euforia here by described the A^ Box as an empoderation act is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, using a call, and then connected from a network of AT & T to another, while he created a buckle with the largest possible number of satellites.
"We were involveing the things around the world a half of times and cried to the public phone and returned a minute later to the public phone at the side of the door," Jobs said with a rice.
"We were young and what we did was that we could build something to ourselves that could control thousands of millions of dollars in infraface throughout the world."
We two, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control something gigant -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that Apple had never existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious brom that he and Wozniak almost leave, calling the Vatican to § of the A Box half night and asking to talk to the Pope while he made his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic Hierarchia were invited in half night to talk to the diplomatic and §, both were in prison just before the same Pope was wake up to answer the phone.
About love for technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At 12 years of age, at the repository feast to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the telephone guide and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"This was a wonderful influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and made my vision of what was a company and what they were treating their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer never done".
She was so big as a male, she had a small catholic tube screen, and I loved him.
With a traveling to HP as a teenager, I would take time with that machine and write programs for it.
About improvizing innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on walk.
Soon in his carrier, since he was dedicated to sell a basic paint, he asked him a customer if he could mount all the team.
Only 30 days of credit, he had to notify the mount and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while he was in Apple, he repeat the fights that were held in the development of a computer mouse:
"I agreed to have dramatic arguments... they cried out that five years would be needed [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I made up and went out and found a designer.
Nineteen days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About large enterprises losing strength:
Much before the reborn of Apple, Jobs prophecy predicted the way many industrial leaders would tremble in their vision, and they would control their market quota.
"Tell me you're working on IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better photocopies and printers, and what?"
You have the monopolie of the market quota, so the company has no success.
Sales and marketing departments increase the success, thus this type of persons who end by leading companies and products responsible are exempted from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of products that led to this monopolie position is able for people who do not have the meaning of good products in bad products - the knowledge of the Office necessary.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have been added from all the information industry.
It could have been ten times your size, maybe the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the loss of the victory.
About innovation as artificial expression:
"There is a great number of work between a great idea and a great product... while the great idea is evoluting, changing and growing."
It is much about the sutilnesses of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do the electrons, the glass make them, the robots do it, the factories do it.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - justify them all at the same time...
At the end, everything reduces the pleasure - turns to exposure you to the best thing that a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things you're doing.
Picasso said the good artists copy, the big artists stole.
We have never seen the ability to steal big ideas.
What was partly great to Macintosh was that people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, which were occasionally the best scientists of the world.
If I wasn't through the informatic, I could have done wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas ceases with the rivals of the sane assistance law while the court accepts the case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered at the closed door to examine the politically controversy issue of whether they would accept the challenge to the sane assistance law of President Obama, two of its magistrates, Antonin Scalia and ́rence Thomas, were charged at an award patrocinated by the signature of lawyers that would expose the case before the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges were gathered in a preliminary audience to study the requests of revision.
One of the cases was a request submitted by 26 states with a challenge of the total reform of the health assistance adopted by the Congress last year, a law which has been a claim of war for conserving activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the request and, in fact, a historical statement of 5 hours and half for March is expected, and the result will probably be more stumbled by the presidential career of 2012, which will be completely appointed at the time when the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and claims that the law should be rejected will probably be Paul Clement, who served as a general tax of the United States during the Government of George W. Bush.
The signature of lawyers of Clement, Bancroft PitéC, was one of the nearly two thousand companies who helped patrocinate the annual dinner of the Federal Society, a group dedicated to the defense of the conservative legal principles for many years.
Another signature that patrocinated the dinner, Jones Day, represented one of the commercial associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Business Federation.
Another patrocinator was the pharmaceutical gigant Pfizer Inc., which has an enormous financial interest in the result of the litigium.
The dinner was celebrated at a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary audience of the court on the case.
Among the assistants, inter alia, Mitch McCon日 was the most important republican in the Senate and one or one declared of the sane assistance law.
Do you have special invitations at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: The two judges have attended the events of the Federal Society for years.
And it's not something that comes into conflict with ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempted from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge may assist events to recover the funds of organizations related to the law and other, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a prosecutor of honor, or in the programme of such event. "
However, the absolute neighbourhood of Scalia and Thomas to two of the lawyers' buffets in the case, as well as a company with a large financial interest, was sufficient to alarm ethical activists in the government.
"This impressive breach of ethics and indifference towards the code is against the requests of several judges to attack the court by the same rules applying to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common Causa).
"The judges were arrested in a re-country of gala funds with lawyers who have advocates in the court."
Its appearance and assistance in the recovery of funds for this event was subject to any request of impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics that say that they meet the court's activity too easily with the agenda impulsed by groups such as the Federal Society.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is one of this activist reserve.
On the other hand, the conservators suggest that it is judge Elena Kagan, who has a ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general seek of Obama administration when the first legal challenges were presented to the law at the court of the first instance.
His critics have pressed Kagan to refuse to see the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as for now to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that I would do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
The Emirates line requests 50 double boeing 777 flights, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six boeing Dreamliner plans to Oman Air, a valued operation in more than billion dollars.
It is rarely new when a company receives a request of 50 units from its product.
But it's a great transaction when the company is the Boeing Co Airlines manufacturer and the sales price for the 50 aircraft is a 18 billion dollar record.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Medium East, a gold mine in growing future aircraft requests.
In a study given on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that in the next 20 years the lines in the Middle East will need 2.520 aircrafts per value of $450 million.
Boeing announced during the weekend his biggest request from the story for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 jets Boing 777 double past.
The successful requested wine of the Emirates line in Dubai.
The line also has a choice to buy 20 more aircraft, which would increase the total sale price to $26 billion, announced Boeing in the Dubai Air Room 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the named Dreamliner, which assumed a fuel accommodation and services for spectacular passengers.
The sales price for six of them is more than billion dollars.
"This has clearly a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Dihora analysis.
"The quality of these customers is very strong."
Many Middle East lines are the property of their oil producers nations.
Therefore, they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but a increase in the fuel prices - generally vulnerable for airlines, because it's one of the largest costs - it's not so vulnerable, because the country wins money with the increase in the price of oil.
This is important because they have less probabilities than other lines to cancel or retrace the flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The request for the Emirates solidizes Boeing's leadership on the broad-sheet aircraft market and helps to maintain the intention of its Airbus SAS competitor to invade its domination with the A350 passenger aircraft.
The victory of Boeing in the air flight has occurred four months after Airbus said that he would turn away the greatest debt of A350, which is computing directly with the 777-300ER.
The debt was repeated to add more impulse after the customers would increase the profitable load and rango.
Boeing Co's actions increased 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, on a disrupted opinion in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderón ́ that the drug traffickers helped their opposite to the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the contents of the Governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her candidature to Government of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she delayed the moon that the drug traffickers helped to inclinate the road for one of her opposers.
The preliminary results gave the front in the carrier for the western state manager to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the crime organized during all the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarmant, not only for Michoacán, but for all the country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the vote on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they were able to be able to make up the urns, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" for the Price.
The PRI governed Mexico during seven deities until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI has the hope of winning the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have overcome a little margin to Calderon, who had led the investigations before elections.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate on the left by the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently occupied by the Governor's charge, remained in the third place a big damage to the left divided and unfortunate before the presidential elections of 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, exhaust of the capital of Morelia, refused to link drugs and encouraged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by specialized drug cards in marihuana, heroin and metanfetaminas.
It is the birth state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offence against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has continued.
A PAN officer was murdered a week before elections, while he was campaigned by Luisa Maria Calderón, and many candidates abandoned local candidatures by fear.
Although for the PRI, for unpleasant who appear to Michoacán's elections, a victory will help to impulse the game.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, welcomed Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very high, from face to next year."
BAsD encourages Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has made an invitation to India and China to prepare them to help the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term receipt that would lead to the growth of Asian economys.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of the Asian Development Bank with Side in Manila, said that the two larger growth economys in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic block already outside the International Monetary Fund or just to bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brasil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in a "inpartial way" and said that Asia's financial assistance together with the European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So anyone who can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected in a certain measure, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, that is by all means."
The European Monetary Union has been severely affected by a sovereign debt crisis in the past months.
In the last days, the costs of debt in Italy have been dangerously shot and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have expired.
The current crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has increased the fears that he could emphasize the world economy to the recession and has generated calls to join the main emergency economy to help the euro zone find a solution.
Mr. Nag foretold that any support in Asia would be channelized to the FMI, but he said that bilateral assistance, such as the purchase of the EU's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund, offered a greater negotiation power for the European Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, Indian Ministry of Commerce, said that "India will do all that is possible" to help the eurozone because its own economy was now suffering from the fall of exports and the deterioration of foreign capital inputs.
"Nobody wants the euro zone to remain instabil and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's a imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others suggest that development economy as India does not have responsibility to help the rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor of the Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically difficult to sell the aid to Europe for the millions of two hundred thousand people in India, from which up to 800 million live with approximately $2 per day or less.
"In some time, it will be noted that the Greeks are jubiled at the age of 50, and they go from vacations to the beaches, and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, manager of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why India's reservations should be used to maintain the numerous and well-loving workers of the Greek public sector, in mal-administrated business jobs, and loss generators such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis of the eurozone threatened with "important effects in chain" throughout Asia.
The predict of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now to "the risks below" due to Europe's threat.
He said that the vulnerable emergency markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant outcomes from their economy.
Series of the Pentagon warning about possible defense debt
The Secretary of Defense, León Panetta, warned the Congress on Monday, warning that the budgetary automates that are involved could cover national security and provoke financial reactions from Pentagon's passports, in Afghanistan's battle fields, to civil mount chains.
The Pentagon is already digging the $450 billion for reductions during the next debt, but now it is afraid of a additional reduction of $600 billion or more in debt that may be imminent if the Congress does not be able to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these scores would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to the Senators John McCain, republicated by Ar©na, and Lindsey Graham, reported by South Carolina.
He said that the failure of the Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the "sequestra" called, would take place 23 per cent of global reductions and a higher to many new projects.
"A so large, applied in this way indirectly, would make the majority of our naval and building projects not able to be executed - cannot be purchased three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate many of our civil officers in an involving way and, because the reduction would be so quickly, it is almost safe that we should license civilians in order to fulfil the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who keep our army and would seriously damage the good provision."
The shorts of time would reach the fighting troops, said Panetta.
"Although the financing for war-times in the accounts of ultra-sea contingency operations does not seem directly affected by the severity, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disasters in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The staff contract would be reduced, which would lead to delay in contracts and supervision of the contract supporting war."
"The staff in nomin would be reduced, giving repairs in payments to providers in wartime, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two Senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting information on the potential impact of the auto-decline in the Defense Department.
"The consequence of a secure in the Defense Department would cause a fast decline from the United States as the main military power of the world."
"We are firmly against this draconic action," the Senators said in a joint communication on Monday afternoon when they published the Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result with which you can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose ourselves."
"The rest is a threat to the interests of the national security of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen."
If the Panetta letter and the recent warnings of Senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or will intensify the calls to exhibit the Pentagon of the recruits is to see.
Panetta has been more prompt about the possible debt, although it has reached a work at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets at the Congress and the White House and knowing that it was to be difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense designed a shadow panorama of what could be in front - an army with a concha, but not a nuclear.
"It's a ship without mariners."
"It's a brigade without balls."
"It's a airline without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of rooms, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his words of opening in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers the low moral, lack of preparation, and it is not able to keep on the day with the potential of opposers."
"In fact, he invites the agression..."
In addition to their letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provides new details of how reductions "generate important operational risks: remain in the time of response to crisis, conflicts and disasters; he is very limited to our ability to be disappointed and committed before in the world; and it provides an unacceptable risk in future fighting operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could face the hacha, including those who are already testing and some are only at the first stages of the planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighting plane, a new planned bombarder, a new-generation Balistic submarine, a new litoral fighting ship and the new fighting vehicle on the ground that the Ejercito and the Marina need to replace, the humvee.
Stop F35's further development and tests could generate about 80 billion dollars for 10 years, but their partners say that it is the next vital step to improve and address China's potential threats and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A view of the latest holders indicates how serious and all-presidents are deceiving and lying in daily life.
The Republican President Herman Cain is occupied by exchangeing sexual accusations with several women; each party is accused of lying to another.
The administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of projury by probably hiding reports that said that a retired football trainer was sexually appreciating children.
Last week, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "pilled" with an open microphone by the President of the United States, Barack Obama, that the first minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Light has destroyed carriers and convulsed countries.
The congressist by New York and exhibitionist on the Internet, Anthony We日, made the ridiculous with its disgustings quickly rejected by the irrefutable test.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of crimes in the financing of the campaign related to the covering of an extra-matrimonial relationship.
And again, no one who would live it will never live the median circle disappointed by President Bill Clinton during his second mandate on his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The laws on traps are very extended in the school and university reviews.
There are cases in which teachers have given the answers of the tests to students in order to be better viewed in their performance assessments.
Mentors that should be teaching the opposite are sending the message to lie and lied are acceptable.
How deceased we're finding?
Any day, studies show that you can lie in any place between 10 and 200 times.
That's sure, many of these lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that the unknowns were lying three times in the first 10 minutes.
Detecting falses, or "the location of lying", is a essential ability that we should all buy, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table-like game, for example, Charada, where the goal is to claim: "I have you," the detection of the engagement is a branch of knowledge would be based on scientific data obtained during the last six deficiencies in prestigious universities that have performed research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physology.
One of the results of the research is that old myths about the lie have been rejected.
The men look at their eyes.
Not always tortamed, balbucean, rumored or worried.
It cannot also be concluded that false people are difficult to detect or dismask.
A trained mentor detector can reach the truth with regard to the declaration, microfacial expressions, the training of questions and time.
For several years, I studied the scientist discoveries about the deception in the wide and always emergent body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of the liability is a modern technology that is easy to ́re and help to navigate through our whole world - especially if their professional responsibilities include contractation, interviews, or negotiations management.
Good men have the ability to read well to others, making them feel pleasure, manipulating their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others feel.
We know about the investigations that extrovertises say more than introvertised, that men say more "men oriented to themselves", while women say more lying "oriented towards others" -- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that married people are less frequently lied to their couples than those who are not married (but the lies that they say are going to be "enorms").
We also know that if you are feeling a misunderstanding, the others will feel less guilty when you lie to him.
How do you know if someone lies?
First, observe the habitual conduct of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline".
Help provide reference points to measure after changes.
Note the position of the subject, laughing and vocal characteristics.
It's better to know if someone normally goes down with the foot all the time to not make unjust accusations when he looks at his feet shooting in the middle of the face.
Following this, search for engaging, verbal, and non-verbal groups.
Consider these groups of behavior as alarm signals, not as a test of error.
People who mislead can congel the top part of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, turn to an output, change their position significantly or show a "post-interview delay" -- that exagered suspire of refreshment and change of position when all difficult questions have been completed.
Often, the questionnaires make sure that the interview has completed only to search for that post-interview advice.
Take also attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put the foot to the background and used the past time while she had her murdered wife alive, launching a search from her at national level.
People who lied can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeated a hard question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtils.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive languages" when he answers a difficult question: "Good... to say truth... until I... I understand."
This makes the answer a perception instead of a fact and is often a signal of warning.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but develop ability to discover error is possible.
These abilities will improve the possibilities of anybody to avoid being victimed by staff artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversy plan of the olive oil transferred after the threat of the United States retraction in its approval
Days after the administration of Obama threatened to repeat the approval of a planned oliveduct from Canada to Mexico Golf -- envying the syndicates while he pacified the theologists -- the company who wants to build the oliveduct says that it is ready to redistribute the project to return to it.
TransCanada said on Monday the night that will move the planned oil outside the area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and he believes that the project will win the approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Nebraska Capitolo.
The Director of TransCanada, Alex Perbax, says that the company keeps his confidence in that the olive oil is accepted at the time, even though it is true that with a different path.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would repeat the decision by a federal authorisation for the project until new potential paths are studied that avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquapher, a large subterranean water supply.
"This is a real way of progress," said the Representative Lee Terry, the Republican of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is possible to separate any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officers refused the policy to be involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department and expressed all its support.
The oil, from 1.700 km, would be extended from Canada to the Golf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barriles per day from Alberta's province to the re-references in Texas.
For that, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the Languageologists, but loved by the working groups, which have been apostated by the estimation of 20,000 jobs linked to the oliveduct.
However, Nebraska's legislators opposed to the plan are submitting legislation to force a distance from the region of Sandhills and Ogallala aquapher, the largest source of potential water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the State Department found that the project had only limited environmental adverse impacts, but the source of energy industry said that the Department General Inspector has ordained an independent evidence of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is if the member of the lobby contracted by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was a campaign adviser of Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interests for the programme.
The other is whether a signature contracted to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle requested by probably provoking a child of fear
A family of New York that the dish of the disc music, Patti LaBelle, was conducted as a crazy in the clothes of his building in Manhattan, and threw her little daughter up to the point that she had feared.
The journalist of "Lady Marmalade" feared Genevieve Monk, 18-month age, so he suffered "personal exchanges, dreams' shifts" and "increased his fear for strangers", says her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was on 10 November of the past year when the tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Rosen, Professor of finance garden, and Genevieve was preparing to go to a family travel.
While Kevin Monk cooked the car, Rosen Monk down to the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with his team, leading to Genevieve.
Rosen Monk said he stopped near the door and put his daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Nobody approached behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said to her, "Yes, and I went to take her," he said.
LaBelle was wounded to the pregnant woman.
"He said in a aggressive ton, "I shouldn't have left her daughter near the door," said Rosen Monk.
"I said to you, "I don't care about what you say or think."
He was wounded and eating to use bad words - the word C and the word J in high voice...
He had a water bottle and empe's to take the water of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve was historical.
"I told this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
LaBelle was aware of the mother -- which still was subject to Genevieve -- and had to be contained by its environment and returned to a car that he expected it, said Rosions Monk.
The little girl was crying so strongly that he smoked, he grew.
Later, the family sent a note requesting a excuse from LaBelle, but he did not receive an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return the calls to comment what happened.
The request for non-specific damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free and that the family planed to give all the money to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This type of conduct is completely unacceptable, especially when it is guided to an infant garden teacher who takes hands to a 18-month-old child."
Climate Inversible Economy
The first year of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, has increased unemployment and informality, has decreased foreign investment and the economy is contradicted
The first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez in 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, which is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, which has generated great expectations for the progress in the economic, but because of the climate of the beginning of the year, it is not observed that growth has been recorded in the main economic development indicators.
The low temperatures of February, as well as the cause of millions lost for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the history of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of yellows, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, in 582 thousand 835 cultivated hectares, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main cultures were of vegetables, milk and garbage.
The fall in economic activity has generated, up to November, a constant increase in the disemployment in the state, the National Statistics and Geographic Institute has made the stational disoccupation rate during the first three trimesters of the year, since, while January 55.053 synagogues were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economicly Active population, for the second trimester the rate was 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase up to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in the number of people was deployed to more than 74.000 disemployed, an increase in the first seam of 18.969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
The disemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the Economy Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the University of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of disemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from the public policy.
"What is seen is a growth of unemployment that has to be considered with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for a restriction of resources by the law adopted at the congress to combat money lavage, and for people who guilty dollars is not easy to work, invest them and use them in anything," he expressed.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes noted that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people that go from the state of work in the foreign, in the United States has been limited first because of the difficulties to enter, and secondly because they already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and asking for working sources here in the state, which makes the unemployment rise," she showed.
Informality
The analysis of the labour market is decreased by considering the high level of informalness between work conditions, is the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population occupied in the state without being covered as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informalness, one of the low payments of the state is the lowest wages, the country has the lowest remunerations, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Work and Social Prevention.
The average income of the synonymous workers was, until September, 5000 352 weights, very lower than the national average, located in 7000 375 weights.
IED contract
On the end of economic activity and increasing unemployment, in 2011 the highest reduction of the external investment in the past 10 years is recorded, and the Economic Secretariate of January to June of the State IED was 630.697 dollars, which represents a loss of 87.74 per cent in relation to the 5 billion 143.000.312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
In its part, the Secretary-General for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total of 17,280 million weights per year, mainly from third sector companies.
The Debt
Before the economic contracting scenario, the State Government requested the State convention to approve a credit for 3 billion weights, as it would be intended to invest in infra-projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local convention was of 2 billion billion weights, and until November no benefits were observed in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Camera of the Transformation Industrie, expressed that in 2011 the harmonization of volunteers from different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, it has to work intensely to restore the land we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to re-evaluate effort, it has failed to align the effort of all of us and, in particular, the good course already synchronized of this new Government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he expressed.
Economy Lenty
Loredo López showed that the events like the ice of the year's beginnings stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The under-economic flow is a product of various areas, including ironed, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn back enough to generate a economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services, and therefore we are closed very under the expectations we had," he mentioned.
Redefine vocation
For Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Conference of the Mexico Republic in Sinaloa, showed that it was reacted to the state to productive activities of greater dynamic.
"In general, we have noticed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and the economic round of the state is redefinited, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that has Sinaloa has has has has been stopped."
Work to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that is better than the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government has been attempted to give good results in various matters, in the field of economic development there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," she showed.
He indicated that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is a work done and I think the Government is aware that there is a work to do," he expressed.
They condemn it by 8 kg of mariguana
At five years of prison and 100 days of wagon, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced by eight kilos of mariguana.
The General Procurement of the Republic informed that the judged narkomanist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of health, in its marijuana position variant for trade.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 in a monitoring operation on the street Cyprian Valdez, before post 80, in the Castillo, Navolato population.

For such reasons, the insurance was available to the Second District Court and the Internal Court continued in the Executive Centre of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Awards for works
The social works listed in programmes such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for people are in risk of not concluded or to have serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Social Development stated that, even though work programmes have been advanced until now, they are in risk when the Government of the State has not fulfilled the contributions that correspond to which it provides a resource exceeding 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He pointed out that the investment in these three programmes is of almost 50 million weights, of which the State corresponds to 25 per cent and that only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for works, so the possibility of repair to the conclusion of these is being made in force.
"There are almost 12 million what touches you to bring and despite the year is going to end, they have not given us a fifth, when they had to give us one part since July," he said, "We have started the works and are very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions corresponding to them, so at the beginning of the administration, the Municipal was required to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million who did not take the State administration at that time.
"We had already passed in the previous session because the State had no economic capacity to participate, and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State had left," he detailed.
Despite the complaint of the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he recommended that the request was made to the Secretary of Employment and Finances, Armando Villarreal, to deal with the management so as soon as possible as possible.
"There are almost 12 million what touches you to bring and despite the year is going to end, we haven't given us a five."
Valid "analogical" court in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of digital analog signals is one of the most important changes that have suffered the world in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) disapproval the constitutional controversy interrupted by the Senate and the Chamber of Members against the presidential decree that continues to be called an analogic pagon from 2021 to 2015, unless the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon was not held in his assignments by issueing the decree that describes the actions to be followed to determine the transition to the earthly digital television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was disapprovaled not to reach the eight-qualified majority of votes in order to declare the Court on the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, designed by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutionally because the regulation of radio and television materials is a faculty reserved by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the Hierarchic and Reserve Principles.
For the project they were voted only for Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and the own Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members promoted two constitutional controverses to impugn the decree, and by admitting the requests, the Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions available for digital transition.
The full of ministers also decided to disapproval the request interacted by the Deputy Chamber, without taking into account the draft discussion, also under Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its intervention, the President said not to match the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot hold the measures to prepare the public administration.
"I don't also think that if it had done it would be affected the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he remembered that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the Federal Executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the rights of the State.
The substitution of digital analogic signals is one of the most important changes that have suffered the world in recent years, and it is translated into a better use of the radioel spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Replacement of the change would be the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "after the economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, pointed out, "require the operation of all the system established, in accordance with the principle of the State's economic rectory, includes a group of assignments that leads to the ability of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries throughout the world has already concluded digital transition, and has done it to the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, when issued the imposed decree, which invades the field of competences of the Congress, in some way, as the supervision of the laws issued by the legislation is provided in the administrative field.
Analysing the possibility of a "vote by vote" in Michoacán
In accordance with the data drawn by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, yet without accounting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 000 74 total acts.
The possibility of the " vote by vote" is a reality regarding the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where the difference between the first and the second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, yet without accounting the votes related to the 879 of the 6 74 total acts.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Mary of the Länder Angles Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, only last 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of lineations in order to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
As reminded, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice Act, while the State Congress adopted the reforms shortly before the legal period was concluded so that they could enter into force in this electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel dismissed its publication in the terms laid down in the Official Journal Act of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the National Justice (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State mandate to constitutional reforms, even though it has no right to " sanction or veteral".
Interviewed in return to the possibility of " vote by vote", Mary of the Länder Angels expressed that thanks to the approval of the lines corresponding by the IEM General Council, the implementation of partial and total accounts of the vote by the local electoral body will be possible.
In this way, the part of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given in the assumptions that: the results of the acts are not covered; there is no scrutiny and compulsory act in the expedient of the box or does not open in the power of the President of the box; or, when there are clear errors or changes of the acts.
Furthermore, the total summary of the vote received in all boxes of the election may be performed when there is evidence that the difference between the applicant winner of the election and which has received the second place in the vote is equal or less than a percentage point; whereever at the start of the session the said request of the representative of the party and/or coalition requested to the second of the notified candidates.
The total report of the vote can also be performed if the difference between the candidate presumedly winner and the placed secondally is equal or less than a percentage point, even when there is a stated request from the representative of the political party whose candidate remains secondly, where the electoral packages are excluded.
It should be noted that in that situation the election of Morelia, where the difference between the first and the second place is 0.16 per cent, although the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts are not accountable.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will be held to a crisis that has placed in that country at the border of the economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will be gathered on Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government that will occur to a crisis that has placed Italy at the border of the economic disaster and has put the whole eurozone in danger.
A Communication of the Chairman's palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will be gathered on Wednesday with the President, George Napolitan, to confirm that he can form a Government.
It is expected to present a office composed in its majority of technocrates, although it is not clear that the new executive will take the charge.
Monti said that he would present to the President the outcome of his conversations with political parties in its intention to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not expressly say that he could form a government, but the tonne of its comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The march is now well delineed," he said.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has stimulated the costs of its debt at unsustainable levels.
The new administration guided by the former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a hard outerity package by the European leaders to restore the fighting confidence in Italy.
Underlineing the pressure on Monti to be quick, the instability of the markets placed the performance of the Italian goods BTP to 10 years over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had been binding to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal Confindustrie, said to the press after he met with Monti: "We said we would have much support for this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's successful opportunities were seen significantly impulsed by the support of Silvio Berlusconi PDL party, to whom the crisis was committed to release the Sabbath.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to have a good result," he said to the press Angelino Alphano, secretary of the Centre Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is significant because many of its members have even been opposed to the Government of the most technological technologies that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary Affairs
The new Government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be adequate reform of austerity.
What blocking or retreat in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreigners was summarized by the pressure by warning that a defect of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started its consultations on Monday with political, syndicates and business groups, as well as young organizations and women.
He'll end his meeting round on Thursday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitan, which has enabled an extremely quick transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would be half, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defence of the eurozone.
Monti said that its Government should continue until the next elections for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give you time to implement reforms before making the elections progress.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the large parties insist that it should be formed only by technicians, an indication of their repairs before a financial pressure process.
Political sources pointed out that mutual disconfiance and disappointments between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The rock of the Spanish is higher than the tics
From the 22 footballists called Spain, ten are based on the 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of the 22 convocates arrived at the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if the 22 convocated by both countries are compared to today's friendship at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and Europe campaigns, number one of the FIFA ranquin, account a wide range of games of class A interelections, Tricolor has only the defensor Michael Umana as the only one who has the 50 international parties.
That number the alcan is the previous Friday in the party against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footbolists playing in the Stars Liga and in powerful Clubs of the Premier Liga of England, holding an intense activity in binding and home copper campaigns, and high-level shocks in European coppers such as Champions League.
Previously, the experience with the Spanish Furia is summarized in complicated eliminations from the Eurocope and the World of Football.
In contrast, tic footbolists have a limited international road in a area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is of the Iker Casillas Archer, which on the previous Sabbath before England (from 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and will introduce a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, driving brain from Barcelona, places 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even in the previous week, were recognised by the EUFA with the other centuries of the Iberian team, the Zubizarreta quoted with 126 and the ariet of Schalke, Raul González, with 102.
Almost near the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He followed Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Umana, they are the isode side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artist Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After Â, only five passed over the 30 games: Keilor Naves with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Searchquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to the 20th.
While Nano Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still not debuted.
The history of Spain is David Villa, with 50 days, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers more with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Fifteen included the country in its round of two decades of traictory

Thank you for staying at our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years of arrival to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we're sorry that you've taken so much time to reach up to Property.
Some people even refer to their concert as the largest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we have played during the last 21 years have occurred during the last few weeks.
We play a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hope that this has made us in a form for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're very anxious to play.
We love that country, we love surfe and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best of the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and her walls to surfe?
We have many friends who are surfeers and I have a great friend living in Tamarindo and the walls are incredible.
My friends were always going to surfe Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are big places to surfe; so we heard, through people who love surf.
When they saw the tour, they came to deliver great shows with many songs.
What have they planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We'll try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we'll try to play a couple of songs from each album and give them to our fans a good and different repertorium.
You never repeat the repertorium.
What's this worth?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's difficult to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertorium we're moving to not touch, it keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reveals us the reasons why we liked these songs and that we could have been able to be advised.
That makes the show more interesting for us, and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of traictory.
When looking back, is it difficult to believe everything they have achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
First, I think no one of us would imagine that we would be in a large rock band and have done it for more than 20 years ago he looked like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and feel much that we can continue to do music together.
We all want and love to create music.
We're happy to go to the places of the world to whom we always wanted to go.
The things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the surrounding of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of large bands.
We're very friends of the people in Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a move comes from a group of friends and it's a little common thing.
From time to time, a band of a city comes, but it's much stranger when five or ten bands come out at the same time of one city.
We are proud and honest to be part of the Seattle group.
We're still playing with some of them once in time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in its tour, so we were happy to be friends of all of them and honored us to be part of that sound of Seattle that happened.
It is also very strange that a band like the one of you remains united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which is, for itself, much more time than many bands.
First, I think we all are happy to be still alive and, secondly, we all are concerned about others.
All of us are very close friends and, thanks to this, have also opened musical adventure that give everyone free to experiment.
We trust each other with the music of each one and couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the famous word has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do they find a balance?
As we went growing, it was easier to find a balance.
We're sure that you're not too rotated because it's easy to fall in that game of the big abilities and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are faced by music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what you bring it, without being capable of being a rock star, something that no one of us really cares.
How does your other project Remember Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never published a disc until Andy died (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because we were so long and the most important is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture thinking in the incredible person that Andy was and how I was laughing, it was always a pleasure to go to work, ridicule us, talk about music and football and much more.
It was a surprising human being, and we wondered it.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your job, especially Eddie Vedder, and why have you chosen it for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that most liked us, so we are concerned to see what Las Robertas can offer in life and must be very interested.
Why are they always changing Yellow Ledbetter's letter alive?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's sing it and I think he's doing it with the first thing that happens to him.
Like a bathroom, what are your influences?
They're so much.
In the first of me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so much that I could talk all the afternoon about the bathroom I love.
How has Pearl Jam succeeded to keep the grunte relevant although it is not a mode?
I think all of us always feel a little of the green word.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who came up at the same time, and, if there's a matter now, I think it's something wonderful because it's music that worth hearing and bands like Mudhoney are doing now better music than ever.
At the beginning, his music had a more dark content and now has become more positive.
What is this change worth?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may seem more Livians, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I wept when I heard them and are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow and there's some trauma in your life and lose a family or a friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and these two songs, of course, represent it for me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still can make music dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is reinternaled for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was entered on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscle force presented on the feet, informed your heading doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, complying with a 25-year prison sentence for violations to human rights under its government (1990-2000), suffers several pains, including a cancer in the language which has been operated four times and that is under control.
The Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, said to the N TV Channel that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the Neoplasic Neoplasic disease Institute to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength of its members.
Aguinaga recommended that Fujimori in his opinion would be a candidate to gain the benefit of the indulgency for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because it is known innocently.
Four times cancer was operated in the language, has a weight loss of weight of 18 kg, with which other pathologies have been gathered, such as the severe erotic gastritis, the kiste of the pancreas, renal calculations, hypertension and the problems of the feet, the doctor mentioned.
Fujimori complies with the reclamation from September 2007 to the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009 he was condemned to 25 years of prison for the death of 25 persons in hand of an army striking scenario that worked clandestinally in the first years of his government.
A woman travels to Mexico to strengthen political links
A official committee, entitled by the Uruguay President, José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and businessmen, will start on Thursday a visit in Mexico in order to expand trade between both nations and to address political issues of the region.
Women will meet the next midnight with her mexican par, Felipe Calderón, a higher point of a meeting agenda with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collectivity of uruguay residents in Mexico, is the agenda distributed by the Uruguay Presidency.
The interview between both presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "appropriate for exchange of information in all the political issues between the two nations", published by the Presidency of South America on its website.
It is local media, Mujica would find that Calderon supports Uruguay in the accident with France when the French mandatary, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax paradises, in G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In its speech, Sarkozy threats to exclude from the international community to those countries who are still taxing Paradise, a declaration that caused Uruguay's §s and called to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico presided since November G20, a group integrated by the emergency and developed more powerful countries in the world, and has a convention with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguay Government has enhanced the concree of fiscal exchange agreements in recent years in order to get out of the "green list" of the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OCDE), formed by countries who have not implemented all international standards of tax cooperation.
In the trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Treaty on Free Trade (TLS) which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The bigotted fontaneer is the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, incansable, for 25 years to save the princess Peach from the bowser's garments, but he has never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to the tents of all the world, has been designed from a beginning to use the features of the computer console Nintendo 3DS, which allows you to play in three dimensions without need of use of birds.
"Marius is the person who has to say how the stereoscope should work without birds," he advised Nintendo's specialised pressure responsible in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game thought originally for this support", since even now successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adjustments of existing titles.
Nintendo's portator has stressed that, despite being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and fluid game.
Alvarez has said "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "single" to join the less famous users.
Once over, the most experts can give a "second return" to the game levels, which this time present more difficulties.
Moreover, users can choose in real time between a "Agressive D" or one who only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "no match optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also provides the travel of the person to a computer console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this Nintendo video game, Nintendo makes guilty to saga followers and repeats the form of success of previous deliveries, consisting of which the bigote's fontaneer will have to replace mined platforms of danger with the aim of freeing Princesa Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, environments, disfractions and enemies and also a "jugable Luigi".
Column takes the extra of Portugal to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced this Wednesday that he was transferred to the extra-governmental Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiration for the US $70 million lavage.
This ends the process so that Guatemala would respond to the request of the North country who claimed Portugal to judge it there.
At the press conference, Colom said that his decision was obedient to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court had already ordained the addition.
He assured that during his mandate he had "not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and made it a tragedy to all the extraditions he knew.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited by murder and serious lesions, and Edgar Moral Street and Victor Street Mures, both by drugs.
The fact by Colom provides a executive traumatism after all judicial and constitutional institutions to process the ex-mandant between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portugal must be issued once its legal situation was solved in Guatemala and guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absuelt by the disfellowship of Q120 million in the Defence Minister when he was president, which was the process that had preceded to the addition, but the Public Ministry called and reactivated the case.
Trinyove has helped 6.000 young people in risk situation
It was born to avoid falling in the marginality of chicks without training
The balance of the first 25 years of the Social Support Trinijove is important: 6.000 young people in risk of exclusion have received aid to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
It adds a hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make balance in an act held in the ancient complete Fabra and Coats manufacturer who attended more than 300 people.
Trinyove was born in the Trinidad Vella camp in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with dogradiation problems or in the situation of falling in marginality.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu held a large number of responsibility officers and institutions that have cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
The variable political representation, in full-time electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Along with the President of the Generality, Artur Mas, and its predecessor Jordani Pujol, they attended the exconseller of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the extension of the main and current concealary of Ricard Gomà.
They also arrived at the large room of the Fabra and Coats the current conseller of the Social and Family Benestar, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of La Ca, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinyove was born in a very difficult time and that the present is also, but he added that the work done up to now "is a good basis".
The President set Trinyove as an example to know fight against the bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for and for the work that is performing," she showed.
Developed an ocuped finger where macrofests were made
The invaders had been added from 11 of the 13 stages of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 employees left the fink in the midnight of yesterday without providing resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the weight that lived by the 51 neighbors of the Balmes Street has reached its end.
Twelve people left the middle of yesterday voluntaryly the immobile that they were illegally occupied, and where they organized macrofests that demanded the neighbourhood, by judicial order and without the need of a police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to avoid repeating the situation.
"From now there will be a access control," said the administrator.
The occupants, who had invaded 11 of the 13 stages of the building - the rest of them are inhabited -, were carried out all the installation of the electricity and part of the water, as well as pinning the walls and left residues of any kind, especially all the sides of alcoholic drinks.
The first three steps were the scenario of the multi-studian festivals, which dured up to two days and disappointed the inquiry.
On the side of the building there is a discoteca, Balmes 51, which has also been seen injured.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has reduced 80%.
The owner of the discoteca points out that the finch investors made him disloyal competition, since they sold the coppers to three euros, while in the discoteca is 10.
Furthermore, the property of the occium had to respond to neighborhood denunciations, while it was pointed out, the distress not caused by the clients of the discoteca, but the inhabitants of the house, and, in particular, the attendants of the festivals that were organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, are the enjoyed neighbors of the area.
The responsibility of the discoteca explained that the troubles were so big that it even reached an agreement with the owner of the immobile and nine months ago "forgive him" the acquirer.
The Urban Guarantee also confirmed that during the last weeks he had received more neighbors for the situation.
The President of the municipal group of the PP at the meeting, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed that last week "delay the immobile immediately to end with the problems of compliance and civility that produce neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the soil there was only a plant of the occupied building, but during the last months the occupation had gone into all the plants of the building and almost all the stages, and that in somewhere even robes were produced.
In this sense, he added that, "the uncleanness is needed to end and be consensus against the incivicity that has been generated in the finger."
Yesterday, the Mossos developed a building in New Barris.
At 15.30 p.m., the police went up to the 35th Street of Mont-Ral, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessed to the building.
The four were arrested at the moment.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide in the opportunity of calling outside polemics on honoraries
The municipal concurrence on the 16 doors repeat the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Amided in the 80s, full of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this printed a few Collserola promotion pasquines.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of Barcelona metropolitan.
Moreover, it was associated with a comparison, in numbers, with the New York Central Park.
With the CMB's death in 1987, the park was again in the imaginary of many, such as the above limit of Barcelona, as the catalyst capital of the little ones that are not oriented in the north-south axis but above (Mount) - below (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as natural park is reduced in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with jabalises in the role of the Yogi Os.
In these, it was until in September the meeting called a megacompetition composed of 16 concurrences for other such ports of access to Collserola.
A door sends the park idea, sure.
Or that or someone wants to put the doors in the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The concurrence, both by its simply organizational vertebral and by what it suggests to reflect on the city, is the subject of conversation between all the Barcelone architects.
It is almost a recurring topic when two members of this ancient cast of elections are recognised in an ascensor.
And this fact stands rightly to one of the few coincidences between three barcellone architects, and university teachers, which have been presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the concurrence is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the litoral front "is necessary" to discuss "the front of the mountain", while the speaking of Ildefons Cerdà, the Green Mountains, has not been carried out.
"You're going to get out of the base that Barcelona's most famous park is the beach.
Among other things, for its great access.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect for whom the title of "Coleserola Ports" closes a "lexical trap": there is no need to think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where it is to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanist world, qualifys the proposal of "intelligent right" with "certain dangers".
Peligros resulted from the "incertain today to project the public space" after the experience that was lived in the 1980s and that he had in the Forum area "at the edge of the cisne".
The first fear is the delimitation of some borders on which it can be built.
"Limiting something is to fix the next step," that's, your overpass.
"You must think of new urbanists, planning instruments, because the currents [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can stand to authentic disasters."
More nice to the question, Modol thinks that, simplifying, Collserola's Valley vertebrary " can be understanded as a park of Barcelona, not", for a question just topographic.
Module recalls that there is already a work made by the Collserola Patronat that "not must fall in roto saco", although it appreciates the opportunity that the adjunction offers to his gremium to intervene in this project "from the first time".
Moreover, he understands that the neighborhood of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "duda" about whether this is the technical profile, which should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a clear", point), which has to be created: "Architects should be only one tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to this question is complete, because on the basis of the concurrence there is a global vision of Collserola: "16 transversal concurrences have been invited in the meaning of the mountain-sea, but there is no long-term reading, which looks and understands the area in its total."
It is at least in its case that it has chosen to participate in the 16 concurrences.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can shoot in a program and definition with the architect of the door by the side.
In its opinion, that is, the adunation should ensure that the franja immediately above the Round of Dalt should provide, in all its view, a area of equipment that had made a slight transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and exits free
After 72 days of arrest, the legal apoderate of the Casino Red gained the permission to the brother of Monterrey's colleague of the process followed by present songs
After remaining 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will come into freedom after that the legal officer of the Casino Red would grant him the permission to the Second District Penal Judge, which follows a song process against the brother of Monterrey's neighbor.
Following the attention to Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of graphics and videos in which Manuel Jonás presumed to pay for a financial quota to allow the regional adunation to allow the clandestine operation of the postal house.
After the public denunciation, the State Procurement opened a penal process against the brother of the panist alms and on 2 September was arrested and arrested for 30 days.
Following four hours before the Agency of the Public Ministry 3 in Patrimonial Crime, he was posted to the Case of Arracho 1, where it was in the Old Barrio of the capital of the State.
In that place, during the 49 days following that, a second arrest order remained after that the Agency of the Public Ministry would reject the criminals of the organized cohesion and crime.
On 19 October, the Cadreyta penalty was assumed to sing with a million and a half weights to the owners of the Red Casino; however, only a few hours remained in the median security reclutch because there were death threats against it.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internal judgment in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second District Penal, Jorge Yánez, who said that at nearly two months of survey, sufficient tests were checked to determine the responsibility of Jonas, such as the cover of 1.5 million weights to the representatives of the staff house in order to allow the operation.
This Monday, the legal approved of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came before judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the neighbourhood of the region; so in the next hours he could recover his freedom.
The legal diligence, the Agency of the Public Ministry added to the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the employees' partners was the one who gained forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to book the name.
On the basis of the 197/2011 issue, the legal permission is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and thereafter no claim may be submitted in turn to the process followed; notwithstanding that there will be no replacement of damage or penalty.
After the audience of the legal approved of the postal house, near the 15:50s the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Secretary of Justice, Jorge Janez, was transferred to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his expedition will be held.
He shall also notify it of the command of immediate freedom issued by the judge.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome gives details of the air accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost life, and seven more people indicate that the helicopter was directly influenced on the ground in full integrity, without that the pilot could have a strong territory.
A press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jacome, Secretary for Communications and Transports, mentioned that prior to dismissing the Nave, the pilot found that climate conditions were appropriate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the territory, the aspas had contacts with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fusleage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so he counted on the requirements necessary for transporting the staff.
Furthermore, he said that in the investigations made in the area of impact, the appearance of parts on the territory is not reported.
"In a search reports that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented in the form Âl.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, accounted for appropriate requirements to transport passengers.
The territory presents a seven-degrees pending at the 30 degrees of inclination.
At present, the secretary assured that it was a priority to comply with the previously possible results; however, research may take several months, even to reach a year.
By its part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeroports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the major state's helicopter operated in cruce speed and that this occurred in a mixed land.
"This information strengthens the chance of a normal cross operation at the time of the impact," he expressed.
At the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jacome, mentioned six relevant items in the investigation:
Visible:
In accordance with the legislation, the flight has been carried out under visual flight rules, this means that the tripulation must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Orological conditions:
The reports in the AICM placed appropriate conditions for the dishing, in accordance with the progress to the limit area between the DF and the Mexico State, were low clouds.
Selected paths:
It is that by the cloud conditions the tripulation has searched for a smaller and higher visibility area towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar's nave are covered, probably before the impact, no control or change in the flight traitor had been lost.
Distance of residues of the nave in a reduced area:
The information available to the moment allows to assume that the impact has occurred on a direct and side traictory.
The pattern of dispersion of residues of the Nave allows the helicopter to be affected on the ground in terms of integrity.
No fire or explosion evidence has been detected:
On the site of the teacher they continue without evidence in the rest of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the research indicate that it could have had multiple contacts with the area.
The field works have been found in parts of the Nave at a height of 9000 200 feet on the average sea level, the land presents a depth that goes from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The graphics show the sequence in which pre-articulation has been discontinued during that cycle.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the minuous search in a larger area than the agreed site, around the accident, has not been found dispersed parts of the Nave, which strengthens the assumption that the impact has been presented in conditions of integrity.
MSS announces a protocol to find obesity gene
The Social Security guides a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and youths; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that a research led to discovering the gene of obesity in children and youths, named the "Genetics of the Obesity of Finnish and Adultance" protocol, which will allow to account with super-pesed markers.
In a communication, the Chief of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemical Hospital of Medical Specialities of the National Medical Centre, Miguel ́z López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of medical, nutrients, and work social ability was integrated.
This team is supported by experts and post-party students of the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
In the research, it is invited to participate in the population whether or not, to attend the IMSS sports units in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out for minors, every Sabbath at 8:00 a.m.
It highlighted that the Protocol was eating in the Portive Quauchtemomo (Mexican Ponente State) and that since 8 October, the activity was carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sport Unit (Mexico Orient State).
Once the objective is to meet 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sport Independence Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sport Morelos (Northern Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetic development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexico to prevent degenerative chronic diseases.
When the World Day of Diabetes was held on 14 November, the goal was to meet three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years of age, with the exercise and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical and inheritant inheritance of diseases in order to avoid risk factors that draw sufferings such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He detailed that the Sabbaths are applied to all participants of antropometric measurements (weight, wheat, cinture conversion), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (required to identify genes associated with child obesity).
López noted that this investigation obeys the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight increase in minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in only six years, in the case of children, 77 per cent in obesity and 47 per cent of the girls; a dramatic ascension was also observed in terms of over-pese," the IMSS specialist highlighted.
He indicated that the justification for the search of the markers is supported in that the population of the country is different from others for its genetic history.
He informed that in average, Mexico has 65 per cent of American Indian inheritance, 30 per cent of Europe and five per cent of African, and this reflects in genes associated with diabetes and weight.
He explained that obesity genetic is generally translated into the incapacity of burning the energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of grass.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral evaluation of children, which allows to detect whether they have some extent or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark color-plaquets (acantosis) in the skin and pre-brace, which indicate the probability that it has lost meta-metholic changes and even pre-iabets.
The information is used confidently, doctors give it to parents in writing, to whom each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle they need to make to prevent diseases.
López explained that there are three main components that cause over-pess, obesity and other chronic sufferings: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain the most of the day sitting before the TV and use transport media instead of walking short distances.
The high calory inhibitor is also required, namely, the highest consumption of sugar drinks, carbonhydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburguese, ether) with high contents in grass and proteins and the genetical genetic analysis in this protocol.
UNAM's asfalt would avoid baches
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develop asfalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, independent of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the landscape were to be added, it would not be necessary to fix approximately 200 thousand baths each season of rain in the Metropolitan valley of Mexico, Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher of the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of a asfalt land is the appropriate, the baches could be reduced in quantity or even completely removed.
At its conference A technological opinion of the baches, depicted in the International Year of the Chemical Year, made known that the carriage developed asfalts modified with polymeters to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asfalt, but with a higher mechanical resistence, both high and low temperatures.
Mr. Najera estimated that this type of modified asfalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely warm, such as some northern cities of the country, to improve their performance and thus the training of baches.
He explained that the asfalt, the weightest part of the petroleum, is a set of molecular fuel, a high molecular weight, called asfalt, and others of lower molecular weight, called Maltenous, which together gives it to the paviment its characteristic vicoelestatic behaviour.
The asfalt's viscoelistic behaviour consists of that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, 120 degrees of its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees of centimeters presents a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, asfalt returns to breaking, added.
The previous means that the asfalt resistance in the streets is not uniform, but that it is changed during the day in accordance with the environmental and temperature conditions, the expert warned chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of the Mexico City in most of them are sealed by flexible pavilion, which consists of six rows of materials, from which the last three involve to asfalt.
Among the most superficial rows, the asfalt folder is covered by small stones packed in asfalt and then compacted.
Each of the pieces that constitute the folder, pointed out, is asfalt.
By transiting vehicles and generating efforts, this allows forces to be very well spread in the land.
If it was a changed asfalt, it would be even better spread, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asfalt folder, many, a last layer called round folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, namely a sand that is also bathroomed in asfalt.
As it's about the layer that will be in contact with the vehicle lamps, it must have more mechanical strength than the asfalt folder and provide friction on the road.
As part of the landing that will receive and spread the efforts, the rounding directory will also have the appropriate speed and should be cared about the material of which it is done.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, because it affects the performance of the asfalt directory.
When the ground is humid, the water spreads inside the directory and it is difficult to go out, this causes a reflashing of all the bottoms of the land and thus the sharing of the bathroom.
In the process of training of a bachelor, he said, the first to dismiss is the rounding movie and only then the asfalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attached to the first signs with appropriate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Research System also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the training of bathrooms and therefore the weight of each of the bottles must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, in order to avoid forming of frequency baths.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asfalt, for example asfalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and allow to repair the bathrooms with facility and unnecessary use of high temperatures.
What missed the Valle candidate to be the new lady Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that did so that Melina Ramírez Serna could not reach the coron of Lady Colombia.
The Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.
The Valle of the Cauca remains again with the wins of lady Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to comply with being in the winner podium, lighting the silver crown and the band that believed it as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result received last night in Cartagena, where Mrs. Atlantic is at ́aside with the crown and cetro, the department has already summed 14 titles of Princesa and Melina, Rose Mary Alzate (1981), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garces Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question that many are doing is what's missing?
Because the result represents the destruction of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Lady Colombia, not in vain was chosen the Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that received Queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Lady Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury took to design the first radical Princesa that he did not agree with his answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Road Leamos.
Vallecaucan answered to the interrogator:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the age, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that me found in infans is "The beginning," is a very deep book.
Now I read "Crimen and Castigo", is a universal book that we all should read; and today I read the book of Irene Nemirowski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Ardor of the Blood".
An answer that was little liked first by the term "culturalising" and second by not explicitly explaining how each of the books quoted it has been marked.
But when Melina finished the ceremonie, she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe is wise, what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The beginning" is a big book."
Among the lanced hypothesis, Valle burned the favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist suggested that when being the preferred, ovationated and the candidate who had all the preliminary premiums (Oster gastronomy resort, voting of the public for the best artsanal advice, and Queen Mother), "is that was awakened the zeal of the other candidates, stretched the Queen and therefore didn't be at the scenario."
And that was noted in his first bathroom presentation on the beach of Hilton and his two defils in the coronation wallet.
Though it was safe in both, it was noted that he missed the strength and impatience that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "As home", of the NCNC Channel, thought that Melina was designed as a princess "checked that the candidate wins more premises during the concurrence does not remain as a Queen".
Moreover, Valle was shown the last very swimming with the press, and he wronged.
Another opportunity is that Valle has not been able to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is recently the essence of the National Court of Belleza.
For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty showed that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their parents.
"The only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it must be looked outside the physical and focused on its social sensitivity, which is already involved in projects before entering the Court."
It is also observed that Valle sinned for its defects in dere and fibrosis that he was noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury has chosen it exactly as the candidate 'Nature' with the most healthy, good food and physical work responsible.
The preparer of Queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognises that Melina had not the best body, which had better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very notorial, lay down points on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, in the Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the vallecaucan was the chirurgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgery's good, but Valle doesn't know what they are doing.
Her body was never her strong, and here they covered her."
For this premium, which for the first time delivered the National Court of Belleza, after the bathroom travelled a cruel vaticium that was fulfilled last night, because it was said that Raymundo was the contents that Raymundo conceived Melina to not give him the pleasure of the crown.
Reality or not, it is true that Melina begins from today a year of rule, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, the position that enables Colombia to represent in one of the international claims by designation of the national Court.
However, she will pass to the story as one of the Queens that, despite her roller passed by Cartagena, her crown was cut off.
That was the work of the hole that identified Alfonso Cano's layer
A lofoscope of Cali passed the story as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officers is key.
Last 4 November, a lofoscope of the CTI of Cali passed to the history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum head of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", to the cottage of its digital holes.
From the seven lofoscopics working in the CTI section, that week was the turn of "disponibility" to Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who worked 21 years ago in the court research area.
When he started his career, González worked in the municipalities of the Chocó, where he often had to enter for more than five days in the wilderness to reach the place where the cadaves were to be identified.
In 2000, it was transferred to the Valle capital and, after performing the appropriate courses, it was specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the breeding skin, namely, from the hands and feet palms.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him that he had a minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
Thursday night he went out to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two travelers and that he had doubted that one of them was the man who led to the oldest war in the world, so they asked him to carry the card of Guillermo León Sáenz (her true name).
However, when he arrived with the research team to the site where it was found, he did not recognize it for its physical aspect, because it was very different from what he saw in the media.
He was without barba, dressed as a campaign in the area, without wallets and much more lower.
But the bullets don't lie.
Along with a galt, tint, a transplanter and a linterna, Eliazar compared the dactilar pressures of the cadaver with the card.
His eyes failed: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man originating from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that was the greatest leader of the Farc.
In search for the hue
For a dactiloscopeist of the Sijèn de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in the press road by the operative against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopy is a precise science, without error margin, which can be key in the crisis resolution.
Besides the identification of cases, lofoscopics support crime investigations as hurt and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they are captured, many criminals have seeds or have no papers.
We're taking them the dactilar print and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that, in a case of hurt, he touched him to remove a wall piece from a house, because there the ladron had supported his hand to take a strong box full of joy and money.
"The walls are hard because they are not adequate surface to take a dactilar print, but in that case we could get the bullet out of the whole hand and identify the criminal, who had participated in different hurts," he recalled.
In cases of murder, the hairs may also dismiss or rebuild suspicious.
Sometimes they found a dead man with licor bottles around him.
The research was determined that a family could be suspicious of the crime and, in fact, a flash in the bottle coincided.
Although this doesn't guarantee that he was the murderer, he places it on the crime scene.
A dactiloscopist of the CTI explained that in the objects "the hulls are removed with chemical or physical reactions".
When they appear, a transplanter or a circle is used to raise them.
After this, the pressures are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many indocumentated Colombians," the CTI expert stated.
He stated that not all is as shown in the CSI TV programme.
So not all that's gold, not all that's touching is going back.
However, if it can be used, if the respective cottage is carried out.
"Indignates" challenged authorities in New York
Hundreds of manifestants were thrown before the Zuccotti place to camp.
A large part of the outcome order was moved to a nearby park.
The integrants of the Ocupa Wall Street movement challenged this morning to New York authorities trying to enter again, under the wide range of a court order, to the Place of Manhattan, from which they were dealed in the morning and trying to occupy another park of the Great Manzana.
Hundreds of manifestants were thrown before the Zuccotti place, where they wanted thanks to a judicial order that allows the "indignated" to go back to camp in the place, while another part of the movement answered to the department by busying a park more north of the city, where there were new detentions.
"Our idea is that, if the court doesn't allow us to came back on the street, we're going to install anywhere else and we'll continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as the seats and peaceful manifestations," said one of the portfolios of the "Ocupa Wall Street", Mark Bray movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indignated" to the exhibition of his campaign, personally described by the leader of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the strong evacuation of the place and allowed demonstrants to keep camps.
Furthermore, the "indignated" went to the occupation of a new park in the confluence of the Canal Street Centers and the Sexte Avenida, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which is a New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Trinity Church parroque.
At least for a hour they were able to occupy the place, but then the police came and went to stop some of the manifestants, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete number, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization ensures that there are several hundreds of people that have been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been moved to support the integrants of the movement and has tried to meditate with the police.
Instead, the place Zuccotti - which is a private property recint - remains closed at the expectation of celebration of a legal view for this same morning in which the legality of evacuation of this morning should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrants moved to Â ́ had and shared copies of that judicial order at these hours and even delivered them to the agents who kept the place, which caused "small dealing", indicated Bray, who claimed that some officials had cups to the manifestants.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to discharge the members of the Ocupa Wall Street or to apply "the laws that have been published after the start of employment or to repeat the manifestants to the park with tents or other properties used before".
Colonel Bloomberg indicated before the press that, due to that judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the manifestants, which warned, however, that local laws did not allow them to install again with campaign tents and shops.
The register personally defended the outcome of the Zuccotti place on the morning, a operation in which about 200 arrests and decided because the manifestants were "vilanding the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the place because it was being "in a place where people were not going to protest, but violate the laws and, in some cases, make damage to others", because " some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The outcome of this morning was awesome and shows that in the Bloomberg Fund is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of the workers and the workers," added the movement carrier, who accused the lawyer to "fellow respect for the freedom of expression".
The responsibility for "Occupa Wall Street" also indicated that they thought to organize "great actions" for Thursdays in collaboration with Community and syndicate organizations, to remember the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgen Mary in a special TV ship
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian statements will appear in the television program "It's a日 Peters Christmas" next 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", assistant in "Baywatch", known by "Playboy", the wife of rock Tommy Lee Music, and now, the act and model will be the Virgen Maria in a special of Canadian Television Native.
The CTV private television channel today announced that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's a Property Peters Christmas" next 1 December by giving life to a very particular Virgen Maria.
CTV has distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known by the broad distribution on the Internet of a pornographic video that appears with her husband then, the "Möttley Crüe" battery, Tommy Lee, appears clothed as the Virgin Mary, supporting in a powder that represents Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a known Canadian chemical of Indian origin that recently acted as a representative in the part of the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appears as Joseph.
Besides Anderson and Peters, the CTV special ship accounts of the Canadian song Bublé, who at the end of March march marched in Buenos Aires with the argentin model Luisana Lopilato, and is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "storra" to Kim Kardashian during one of its concerts in New York.
Japan reneces after the earthquake
The PIB increases 1,5% thanks to household consumption and ends the fall-speaking spiral that started in March
Since the last month of March, Japanese economy was paralyzed, even convactive by the earthly devastater who became in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that suffered the Nipone country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Tokio Government encrypted material losses in $300,000, a fight that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been reduced.
After three trimestres of falls, the data of the Interior Bruto Product between July and September served to pass the page, definitively: the PIB increased 1,5% compared to the previous trimestre and 6% annually.
The recorded in the second trimester - for Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - also provides the highest growth rise from January to March 2010.
The recovery is, in part, explained by the reference to the purchasing of maireachtry to restore the areas sold by the sixth and the later tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment in 1,1%, against the decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first retrocess after six months of uninterrupted expenditure.
However, the real revolution of the Japanese economy is not based on the kinesian impulse that invites to use the crisis to strengthen or rebuild the infrastructures, to use the carences to grow from zero.
Japan has, in particular, wake up thanks to the development of the domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese PIB.
This variation scaled a 1%, emphasised by the increase in costs in vehicles, travels and busy activities.
The y's stigma
Tokio has been commanded in the internal market, when yen - the Nipone currency - has become one of the "reverse values" chosen by the investors who flee from the debt crisis in the euro area and the U.S. previsions turbies, a privilege that weighs as a band in the accounts of export companies.
With a stronger division, the products result in the more deep in the foreign, a serious reverse to a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of the large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, reached their weak results between July and September to the yen cotisation.
While markets continue to assist the EU perifer countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not be guarded.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economys, the impact of Thailand's inundations and the quickness of yen," said the Secretary of Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa, yesterday.
And, in fact, the perspectives are not encouraged.
The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OCDE) needed that most of the Member States presented more negative signs of economic rating in September.
The indicator that precedes the inflexion points in the world economy stressed that the main potential is in breathing.
Since four decades were down to the 100.4 points, before the 100.8 August.
The euro area, including under the average, is located at level 100, was added eight decades to the 99.13 points.
Atenas refuses to feed the doubts
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment
With peripheric risk premiums and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parkings, Greece continues to retreat in the lab that leads to the outcome of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new entire transition Government is more taxed by the needs of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative for the reforms of the Reforms and that the period of hundred days agreed in its designation might be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservator Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that it would not support new outermost measures in any case and repeated its need for new elections for the given date, on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the summary of 26 October," Papadimos insisted on the opening of a parliamentary debate yesterday that will make a vote of confidence to the new Executive tomorrow.
A package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officers and new measures against tax evacuation will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaria does not clear the doubts about its position: "We have committed us to help the Government of transition, but we have not committed anything else."
The Conservative leader was a farer patrol in its puls to the EU and the FMI, the agencies that should dislock the 8.000 million Atenas needed urgently, and it clearly showed that it would not give a good view to any compliance letter of the adjustments.
However, the European Commission, which has yet been aware of the impact caused by the Order of the Reference of Papandreu, repeated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not dislock the aid if the new Government and leaders of the main parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambition and as soon as possible".
The Economy Affairs Porter, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return to Athens very quickly to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth tram" of 8.000 million, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek wood has still a hill for mouse.
Lady Sofia: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "president" place of Spain in relation to this type of funds
Spain " has reached a worldwide place in the role of the Microfinances."
The Queen Doña Sofia remembered yesterday that the country has become these two last deeds in the second donor of the plant in relation to this cooperation instrument, whose "essential" indicated that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on confidence in human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the World Country of Microcredits in Valladolid with the conviction that "no doubt" that it is a type of operations " absolutely indispensable" to reach the Millennium objectives set by the United Nations with horn 2015, and, very particularly, in the one who has the meaning of the reduction to the half of people living with incomes less than a daily dollar, with which the "poverty shadow" is fixed.
Spain "continue working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all the resources of the planet, and to take this task with "responsibility", pointed out the Sofia, which hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating in the Cumper, which will be extended until Thursday, "should guarantee the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women," main benefits of these loans.
They are "a lot of achievements" and "much of the challenges to whom we have."
The Microcredit summary is not only planned as a forum of debate but also as the platform from which to impulse "two basic targets".
Thus, His Majesty explained that at the end of 2015, 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that hundreds of those homes are out of the poverty shadow in which they are summarized.
The impulse in the concept of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world has "followed the road started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sophia as a "righteous act and recognition due".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as a "beautiful idealist in the universal cause of fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know its currency policy on the ground.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summary in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada, 2006, and "in all I could find the continuous evolution," explained his Majesty, whose link to this project was valuable yesterday the qualification of the "Family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "baker of the poor".
Finally, the Queen Doña Sofia concluded its intervention by encouraging the presents to participate in the debate and search for solutions to promote the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperial"
The Ministry of External Affairs, Jiménez Trinity, warned that solidarity "is a ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this regard, I expressed that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to economic well-being times, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez believed that microcredits suggest "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty" and now "more than ever" the developed countries must work under solidity criteria and not allow this to be a victim of the debt.
For Spain, the microcredit consists of "one of the main development cooperation lines".
By its part, the Secretary of International Cooperation State, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" to give "trust" to people "excluding those who are all closed the doors" and the Valladolid's officer, Javier León of the Riva, welcomed the presents to a city who "opened their counted doors of the soldier spirit".
The CDU proposes to choose the European President for universal suspect
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties to Angela Merkel, Canciller and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially, the future of Europe was not included in the order of the day, but the issue was used in ottonic, in particular to satisfy the military men who believe that the Government policy is currently too small with the Greek and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidentship of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was approximately adopted by a singleness.
From the 1.001 delegated, only nine votes were recorded against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes that, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, are discovered of any doubt.
The key idea of the Canciller, and of the movement, is summarized in a lemma: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe provides peace, but also because "new million jobs directly from the euro".
For the Canciller, "the time has come to open the road in Europe."
This could be demonstrated in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to enhance the European Union's control on the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also deploy the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suspect to "take a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the invitation adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
There is no doubt that the twenty-seven are quickly reaching an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is shown enemy to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the bottle is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates have made a majority of the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the Directive of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
In order to calm the animosity within its party, Canciller has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also not that he has won its congress by the "small" European countries or countries in difficulties to criticize German arrogantly.
Although the movement on Europe refers to the importance of "the French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned in France.
Besides the past.
Remembering that, two centuries a bloody battle in Leipzig has occurred.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating destructions for Napoleon’s army.
Fraude fraud in lows per disease
After subsidies, the UMP and the Government commit an offence against lowness by disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Thursday 15 November in Burdeos to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and to proclaim a discussion on the subject, which has been repeated since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will of rigorous abortion, but that still refers to an axis of the presidential campaign of debt, most want to focus on lownesses per disease.
Firstly, to apply budgetary recourses: the Government intends to impose the workers in the private sector a fourth day of carence before they are able to take the low.
Finally, unless there is a specific company convention, a worker falling was four days of salarie, which is at least 15% of its incomes men.
It is a measure that could rise up a wrath oil, but that would allow 280 million euros to cover, if les Echos.
Furthermore, it would be accompanied by another way with a more Simbiotic achievement: to impose officers a day of care without remuneration in the case of low work (for now, they have no care, before the three days they are applied in the private sector).
While these issues are discussed, the majority replace the issue of fraude on the table, this time oriented to the abuse of labour lows.
"They will be increasingly considered the controls and, in addition, if someone is discovering a fraud, he must reimburse the quantities," advised Xavier Bertrand speaking on Sunday 13 November.
Like in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem quite unproportioned for the reality of fraud in the field of labour lows.
In fact, since 2002, a constant follow-up of this issue has been carried out and several political offences have been launched that normally have produced fruit.
The French are not more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us consider the national numbers primarily.
The French Social Safety Institute (CNAM) was approved in 2006 in more than 237 million euros.
The French Research and Documentation Institute in Health Economy was represented by low subsidies in 2008 by 5 per cent of health expenditure, increased by EUR 11.300 million.
From this sum, 46 per cent corresponds to lowness by maternity and work accidents, while 54 per cent is related to lowness by disease, a number of EUR 6.200 million.
Therefore, 2,5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French have taken a average of 14,5 days of low work, before 17,8 in 2009, a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
A average that, of course, hides discharges: another investigation, published in 2007 by the Monster.com professional management Syria, showed that 75 per cent of the 400,000 questioned French assalaries had not taken one day of low disease.
Another study, in this case of the Insurance disease, indicates that in 2010 37% of lowness per disease had been less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them to our European neighbors, the French workers are not more prompt than in other areas to take low disease.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the total labour absent rate (as for health reasons as well as for other types), in France, between 10 and 11 per cent, was 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The fraude in lowness by disease is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work.
Fraude has a very limited achievement.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused the systematic control of lowness by disease over 45 days.
In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM checked at 13 per cent of the 285.000 conducted, that short-term layers were "injustified or too long", meaning 37.050 cases.
In the case of lower than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11% of the cases were "duely adjusted or unjustified; a number that, having a total of 1,2 million, increases to 132,000.
Therefore, a total of 169.000 "injustified" cases are achieved among millions of workers who have taken a low disease.
There is no doubt an insignificant number in comparison, for example, with black work.
The lawyer of the Dominique Tian UMP, author of a report on this issue in June, would represent a loss of tax income between 9.000 and 15.000 million euros per year, which is more than the total cost of the subsidies for low and, of course, considers more than fraud in this last area.
Papademos: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This stated on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament; he also added that the hundred days granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve such objectives.
"To make efforts to recover the economy, we need support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," stated the Government Chairman, which expressed its first public talk during the debate on the trust vote to the Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Euro Zone summary on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, since the country's stay in the euro area was added "in play".
Consequently, Papadémos has planned that the public deficit of the country would be reduced to 9% of the PIB before the end of the year, after reaching a 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The new outermost measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the group of debts, showed its support on Monday for the measures already approved to exit the debt crisis, but he warned that its party would not be committed with additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he adopted along with the members of its "New Democracy Party".
He indicated that it was in accordance with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as combating deficit, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the FMI and the EU would not debloque the loan of EUR 8.000, without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the measures provided, Antonio Samaras replied that it would be sufficient and that it would not sign anything because of the external pressure.
A Committee of Experts to legalize Eutanasia and Assisted Suicide
Canadians live refusing death, the Real Society of Canada is reported
The Committee claims that governments, health assistance institutions and doctors cooperate in order to ensure better paliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives refusing death.
In fact, only 9% of the Canadians are ready to talk to your doctor about the conditions they want to die and take provisions for this purpose.
It is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report of the Real Society of Canada, which was involved in six experts in various areas, including ethics, legal and doctor.
This committee recommends the Government to modify the criminal code in order to allow assisted suicide and eutanase, when the patient is prepared for that option and has been judged competent to take the decision.
To begin, experts quote a recent investigation of the United Intelligence Economy that compared the quality of death in 40 countries in the world.
Although Canada is occupied with the tenth post, the study states that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to treat the subject of death."
With medicine or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to paliative care, the experts selected by the Real Society of Canada are indicated.
And although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them ended in the hospital.
In total, the highest rate in this sense is the Quebec record, where 86% of the deaths are produced in the hospital.
As regards the criminal issue of Eutanase and Assistent Suicide, the authors of the report have reached conclusions that do not match the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that he does not want to change the criminal code in relation to Eutanasia and assisted suicide.
However, experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or are not a criminal crime, have no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal crime has not caused a misuse of their application, such as the use of Eutanasia or self-sufficiency with non-responsible persons or that they have not given their commitment.
Jocelyn Downie, with the report, was yesterday by telecommunications that were more observed in those countries where eutanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized.
"In Canada, Eutanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, the assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, favorable to Eutanasia
Remember that 85% of the Canadians have already been spoken for Eutanasia, since they believe that they would allow people whose death is next to allocate their suffering, it is indicated that an investigation of Reid was carried out in 2010.
Moreover, 66 per cent believes that the legalization of Eutanasia will not make sense that life of elderly or disappointed people is less valuable.
As regards those who have exercised aid suicide, 41% of the questionnaires believe that a process should not be started against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health assistance to a patient, the situation is not so clear, the authors of the report are indicated.
In addition, among its recommendations, it is suggested in the Criminal Code that the retirement of healthcares, if legally dealt, does not constitute a criminal crime.
The Committee of Experts also requests to form health professionals in respecting the fact that a patient is assisted to the end of his life without fear to make a claim.
The Committee claims that governments, health assistance institutions and doctors cooperate in order to ensure better paliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to the Palestinian or terminal seat, which is already used in the Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it is considered Eutanasia and is subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other health law experts have already shown their reservations in relation to the conclusions of the report of the Canadian Real Society Experts.
Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the right of health, has qualified of "extreme" the position of experts signing the report, among other things, because the practice of Eutanasia is not limited to the terminal stage.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is disappointed to live and has more than 18 years can ask for help to suicide," says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also highlights that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy to any other value of society.
However, it adds that "in society there are labels and limitations".
The health expert Margaret Somerville also expressed its "fortunate opposition" in relation to the conclusions of the report, which qualified of "manufacturing for Eutanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Real Society of Canada, is particularly judged by the lack of abuse in certain countries where eutanase and self-sufficiency are legal, such as in Netherlands and Orgon.
The king of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon the power
Declare a "complot"
Syria is still more here
The parties of Bachar El Asad were shown in the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Asad was intensified yesterday that, with Russia's support, resists and claims that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after Syria's suspension by the Arab Library, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against ́co, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have been demonstrated in favour of the abandonment of power by President Asad.
King Abdala II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who asked President Bachar El Asad to "leave the power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already fallen.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, it should be dismissed, in addition to creating the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, neighbouring Syrian country, announced in an interview for the BBC.
In its part, the leader of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has lamented that the mediation efforts carried out by Turkey from the beginning of a year with the Syrian regime have been completed in a failure.
"Whoever is not in peace in the Middle East with his people and cannot satisfy them, they will go away," he declared by proclaiming Syria, a neighborly country in which Turkey is adopting a more difficult position.
In its part, after the decisions of the Arab Library and of the European Union, the United States have concluded that the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime has been "enhanced.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Ligue and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting a more harder tonne" in relation to the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, leader of the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 citizens have already lost life and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the area of Deraa, South Syria, has been announced by the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (OSDH).
Other two civilians have fallen "for bombards and thirsts with weighty ametallators in Jobar" in the Homs' seated city, if it indicates that NGO.
The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considers by its part that the country "forward to the end of the crisis".
Moreover, he has firmly reacted before the decision of the Arab Library to suspend Damascus of its functions, which, in its opinion, constitutes a dangerous step.
Syria "no flakes" added, guaranteeing that "the complaints against Syria will fail."
After the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab Library now studies a " civil protection mechanism" and wants to send to 500 members of human rights organizations, of military media and observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also demonstrated its support for the sending of observators of the United Nations to contribute to protect civils from the repression of the regime which, in its opinion, is closed in the "paranoia".
It is intended to celebrate a new extraordinary holding of the Liga tomorrow in Rabba to put the implementation of the outcome plan of the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, the destruction of the armed forces of the cities in the hands of opposition and liberation of the detained manifestants.
The Russian Ministry of External Affairs, Serguei Lavrov, has judged the decision of the Arab Library yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis output plan, although she did not show its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against guardian.
Italy
Monti requests time for the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future leader of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested some time for the markets to form their team and implement a programme that will include "offs" intended to recover lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and has meet today with the university and the patronal.
I would like to form a restricted office, composed of external technologies to Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad program with many sacrifices," he advised Francesco Nucara, member of one of the small parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after meeting with the appointed Council President.
For its part, the President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, has expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence to Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr. Monti's presentation of a limited list, without doubt of a twelve ministers, to the Governor of State, Georgio Napolitan.
Monti commented on the nervousism of the bursatile markets and the obligatorysts yesterday, asking them time.
In the "democracy, there are a few precise terms" to form a Government and prepare its programme, he stressed that it is "certain that the markets will have patience and understand it."
Her designation by the Chairman was initially obtained the goods of the markets, but thereafter the concern was used, especially after an unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should create a team mainly formed by technologies, even if he has highlighted that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government must operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, considers.
The President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive the vote of the Parliament's confidence before Friday.
Monti has committed that, when he takes the charge, he will work with the urgentity and with the goal that Italy "require its protagonism" in Europe.
A portrait of the European Commissioner or Rehn stated that "with a new Government, we will not change our diagnosis from the Italian economy."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its objective to achieve a budgetary balance in 2013, despite the plans of austerity adopted during the last months, has requested the adoption of new rigorous measures.
The Italian leader Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her mate, also insisted on the need to impulse the economy, "for a country that does not grow cannot comply with the deficit requirements."
Monti, whose competition and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), provides a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "profesor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", are the editorialists.
The great ignorant will be the long-term of your team.
President Napolitan wants to avoid previous elections, since Italy has to place about 200,000 million euros before April 2012 in State obligations.
A Russian scientist has cooperated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has cooperated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapons, was held on Monday a American NGO specialised in the atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the International Scientific and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) and other documents issued by that UN Agency.
The AIEA showed its "great concern" last week by a "possible military dimension" of the Iran nuclear programme.
ISIS, based on AIEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades since 1960 in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the production of synthetic diamants by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have abandoned the center to form a company focused on the production of "noodyans" in Kiev.
The economic problems of its company would have brought him into contact in 1995 with the Iran Embajad in Ukraine.
Then it was considered to cooperate with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA states that there are "clairs indicators that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, which was not only well-known of the technical, but also, a Member State has been informed by the Agency, worked during most of its carrier in that technology in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased 50%
Crime and crimes against Muslims have increased about 50% between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence have reduced or increased only lightly, the statistics published by the FBI are indicated on Monday.
The total number of violence acts committed against Muslims has passed from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, meaningly, increased by 49%, against 13% in the case of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4% in crimes against Jews and a total increase of 14% in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crymmes" has grown lightly up to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% must be racial differences and 20% to religious differences, is indicated by the FBI.
"With a decline in 2009, it is concerned that they have sought to increase this type of crimes and crimes," stressed the human rights defence organization first, "the increase of violence acts against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a communication.
"Human Rights First takes a long time by indicating that violence against the Muslims, as well as all types of hatred crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds a responsible for the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The Government and Property can and should strive to end these abuses," adds, considering that these efforts could include a improvement of the police reports on the "hate cryems".
"Owner crime" in the federal law and was inherited from the time of combating civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish the acts of violence linked to race, the color of skin, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes your platform and seems more like Facebook
The Microblogging Twitter site has presented its platform on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of people who follow, which causes their service to appear a little more at Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another named "name" allows to continue more readable and directly the activity of other "Twittos", namely, of those internal ones whose messages ("tweets") follows on the Internet or follows you.
This allows you to know whether they follow messages, if they are subscribed to new accounts, if they qualify some message of favorite, etc.
This new Twitter formula is trying "with a small percentage of users in August" before spread it to the rest of the network on Monday, it has been indicated to the AFP the Twitter portator, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known by his short-instintive function, with clearly exhaust terms (RT to send a message from another person, follow-friday to recommend following another user) which makes the happiness of the initiatives, thus opens a larger public with a more comparable manage to the Facebook and Google+ large public networks.
In the network, users have discussed "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's unusual, it's invasive and it seems too like Facebook," write @jimb123.
"The Activity function will help me to follow better some of my Twitter flow elements," write @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "oral rule" budget in the Constitution
The Government of Great Social Democratic/Democratic Coalition, which is in the power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "good rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit assessment agencies (triple A).
It was the own social democratic Canciller, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a very higher number than the maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was decreased at one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3.000 million more in interests each year," said the Democratic Christian Vice-Christian of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus replies to a request for the Brussels Country to Member States of the euro area of last 26 October: In it the State and Government heads requested the inclusion, before end of 2012, of the reduction of public deficit and recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is approached to the "German Model", since Germany was the first European country who adopted such "regulation".
Before 2017, the public deficit should be decreased by 0.75% of the brutal internal product (PIB) each year and, since 2017, the public deficit of the Federal State should not exceed the 0.35% of the PIB each year, while regional States, as well as communities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that the public debt to 2020/2012 is decreased under the 60% criteria set out by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threats with a new intervention in the exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Thursday that the Nipse authorities would again intervene the marking of change if yen continued to increase.
"We will interview, as we did last time, if we check that there was a volatility" in the type of change of yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went up to reach a number of levels close to the maximum history of the Japanese authorities' intervention on 31 October.
On that day, Tokio sold massively yen for dollars to reduce the value of the nipone division, which just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the currency and the monetary.
But the yen has gone along with paulating since then, impulsed by the purchases of investors who consider it a "value of resistance" in these uncertain world economic ralentisation and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar returned to cottage on Wednesday, less than 77 yen, and the euro descended under the 105-year symbiotic bar, reaching a nearby levels to which the last intervention was caused.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This explosion of nipone division threatens exports from the country, since it carries Made in Japan and reduces the value of the income in the foreign of Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan's fighting to rebuild" after the sixth and tsunami of March 11th, who destroyed the region of Tohoku (noreest), pointed out Noda, that it is afraid that the carrying of the yen of roots of the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third trimester ( 1.5% in relation to the previous trimester) for the first time in one year, thanks to an increase in the export and consumption of homes affected by disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of yen does not reflect the "Japan's economic bases".
The Ministry of Finance, Jun Azumi, requested the Japanese Bank (BoJ), that he initiated on Thursday two days of its Monetary Policy Council, to adopt all possible measures to debilite yen.
However, the added Governor of the Institute, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", understanding that there should not be a greater monetary flexibility on midnight.
At the end of October, the emission institution increased in five billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Letters of the Treasury, leading to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the amount of the funds dedicated to the acquisition of several financial tickets to cover the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the guys grow, the bottles flaque
The risk of counterparty of debt crisis continues to threaten Europeans.
Despite the nomination of new Government Chefs in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth numbers in France and Germany, the types of the most weak countries continue to increase.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area's stability, the European bottles are still a little more in the negative area on Thursday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, CAC 40 loses 1.4% and is located at 3.064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and in London a 0.1%.
"Beholding the new tensions in relation to the performance of the loans of the euro area States, the urban markets of the world continue to be part of their recent profits."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly conscious of the risk of county," explains Terry Pratt, the institutional corridor in IG Markets, quoted by the Re日s Agency.
The Tokio Board has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market interventors in relation to the ability of Europe to maintain debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has the fixed view in Europe and exchanges will continue to be made in a decreased margin of changes, so investors will not have evidence that the situation has been stabilised," Mitsushige Akino, the fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
Reparation of concerns for the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to be reduced on Thursday.
The euro continues at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
10 hours ago, the European division was 1.3570 dollars, a fall of 0.4%.
Corridors have lost valuation after the party of Canciller Angela Merkel, the CDU, which was gathered on Monday at the Congress, is adopted a motion that, in particular, provides the option that a country in difficulties comes out of the euro area without abandoning the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types exceed 6%
Italy and Spain's credit types remain at a very concerned level.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of the 10-year Italian obligations reached 6,85%, while the Spanish titles offered 6,2% at the same time.
These tensions relating to the types of interest in Southern countries, although France also continues to feed the fears of interventors.
The leader of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time for the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is the risk of accommodation with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, from its part, has made that the implementation of the decisions taken in the Euro Zone Country on 27 October would be the "the main work" of its Government.
Spain is at the point of markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference of types ("spread") between 10-year-old obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
Waiting for the euro area growth numbers
Since the statistical view, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4% in the third trimester, which is a more favourable number than 0.3%, impulsed by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has reviewed the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of the brutal internal product (PIB) instead of this stocking.
Moreover, the fourth quarter is what really concerns the economicists.
Germany, partly, has registered a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first provisions for the total euro area are provided at 11 hours after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new receipt.
Energy policy:
the facts must be more valuable than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be treated taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking of emotions, it is energy policy.
Electricity and cost are directly influenced by the acquisitive power and the company's ability.
It is appropriate that a electoral meeting is the time to reflect on these issues and on the location of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it studys the sum of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
French should base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now as we are 7.000 million people on the planet, demography evolution will result in the duplication of the request before 2050, unless a large part of the world population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to paly the scarce of the fossile resources to continue to produce electricity continually, without enlargement of the need to reduce the inver-effective gas flows to combat climate changes, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
This is not the case or Belgium, which submits to the need to find a source that is able to establish it, or from Switzerland, which is only intended to build centrals of last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for citing some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, on their side, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park, restoring the construction of a central interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as example, the reality is against such a speech.
The Berlin election will provide an enhancement of the electricity price, a higher energy dependency for the increased need for imported gas, in particular Russia, to increase CO2 levels for the construction of gas and carbon centers.
In a few months, damage effects shall be noted.
Consider the case of Denmark.
Europe's campaign in the eolical sector, from which 30 per cent of its electricity, is also one of the major carbon and gas users due to wind intermediation; therefore, its CO2 and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors have an electricity factor of 40% higher than the French homes.
While in globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor of energy and guarantee of maintenance of industrial use in the national territory, the French companies benefit from Europe's smallest electricity.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would provide a strong extent of the electricity price, which would remain realistic to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of our acquisitive power.
It is a price that the major majority of French refuses to pay and, in fact, they do not show opposition in principle to this type of energy, the investigations are shown.
Remember that our country's energy policy has lost a industrial sector with 125.000 directors of work and 41.000 indirect jobs.
Extensively oriented to export, a specialized pymes galaxie on international markets and which can create non-localized jobs.
If France had decided to leave nuclear energy, it would assume that most of those SMEs were sacrificed and the loss of EUR 6.000 million annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electricist would carry out an EPR designed to operate sixty years when its manufacturer's deterioration is intended?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no wonderful source of electricity production, as well as no daily source.
The development of the Areva solutions with low CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions shows the complementary character of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is unnecessary to maintain the maximum safety level.
In France, we have a Security Authority who exercises a strict and transparent control both on existing centres and on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognised professionality, are also provided by security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the Three Mile Island, has occurred in normal operational conditions; it has not caused consequences for people or environmental environments.
In Chernobil, the accident was due to the design of the reaction and to imperdonable human errors.
In Fukushima, some people seem to appear that the accident was due to two natural catastrophes of an inconvenience, which caused the death of decades of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will be of this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between the security authorities and French and German operators, the EPR provides a design that can resist such phenomenon.
While all the actors who want to build a central student study it would be a great gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, since they would leave them free to take leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be unresponsible to allow emotional, dogma and partisan maniobs to dominate a so important debate for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration, a load or a opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services undertaking the number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the auto-proclaimed status of the "human rights countries" of France.
Recently, it is the administrative accommodation of foreign students that has shot to the holders with the Ministry of Interior (see Libération of 23 May) by declareing that France "not needs foreign talents, workers or friends."
However, it is rarely analysed from the economic point.
The question is that, on this subject, there is a lot of consensus between the left and the de-.
In the case of the de Capulet, Jacques Chirac fixed the orientation stateing in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with approximately two million immigrant workers", while at the left, the tone fixed Michel Rocard explaining that France "not can be charged with the whole world's poverty" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the department feared the invasion of the national territory by a majority of Poland sources.
On both sides, immigrants are considered a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act in relation to immigrants.
In its programme, François Holland is limited to include banalities, indicating that the development code will be allowed to solve the "the problem of halting".
This idea of immigration as a load, a problem, may be rentable electorally, but economically is very faced.
As the economicists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron indicate in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shape Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton ́ Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consciousness between specialists on the positive impact of the flows on economic growth, salaries and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration debilites growth and threatens to employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can submit national workers, especially to the smallly qualified, pressing to reduce their salaries.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually more complementary than national workers' substitutes and mainly exercise professionals in non-employment sectors.
The smallly qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not affect national workers and most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not satisfy personal request.
A positive effect on salaries
The same way that a chirurg would have difficulties to work in a country that lacks anestestists, the complementality of national and immigrants causes the arrival of these recents to be positively affected by the salaries and employment of the nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase in 1% of the fluids is a long-term extent of the real salaries between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without prejudice to the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of Nobel and naturalized premies and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, since they have a average 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
The International Work Organization, for example, calculates that in Germany a immigrant coming with a 30-year-old a net (low-expenditure income) of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points he missed "with the teeth".
These teeth, which dismissed the immigrants, had exactly the inverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, just needed to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a pretty good, but also fragil.
The European continent should be able to agree that, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, during the 20th century, the tragedies of the World War have suffered, totally ́smos, the Holocausto, the gulag, but also France in Spain, in Salazar in Portugal, the Crowns in Greece.
Some may have believed that, so that democracy might be definitively triumphed over their enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and the most directly possible way.
We know, from Napoleon the Small, that was about something thought.
The universal suspect, although it is a needed for democracy, is not enough for itself and can even become a "oppression instrument", as the Republican Ethiopian Vacherot said anciently.
No, democracy is much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, a organization, separation and control of powers, education, Luces, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is a economic crisis, but it is going to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double manifesting effect: showed the need for a powerful return from the political area, but also the concernful sense of its impossibleity, its incongruence.
Consider this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines of the front of the Democratic Battle are currently moved and, in many cases, the Republican soldiers are no longer in good sense.
We will not go out to win if we are a success of national references, organized in accordance with the needs and in a disordinated manner.
A white signature to the absolute European monarch or a high to the empty nationalist cow: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take effects, but a common exercise, full of right, peaceful and continuous, from options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only a crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The entire Europe is the one which is too close to market orders and qualification agencies, the one who suffers its impotence and the lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe who suffers a humbleness in the international area.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe who slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent is that popular sovereignty recovers the team of the European project.
Because only together, Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, be released from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that will not be able to be taken without a total democratic legitimateness, except to lead us to disaster.
After a long time fighting against this proposal of socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now asks a European economic governance.
Let's be so.
But think about it without a greater political and democratic integration, and without being alive as the citizens, it would be a new fool and would bring us to a new dead point.
We have taken a new stage of the European building.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" republicians.
The revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We are building a more integrated Europe from the economic point.
Only it can be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, we do Europe.
Cards with "uncontact" chip are generalized
The world room of chip cards is started on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with a optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should be completed with an increase of 11% in the worldly sales of microprocessor cards (carts, SIM card phones, etc.), with a total of 6.000 million units, if the Eurosmart office calculates.
The most powerful segment is the of the uncontakt technology, which allows the common transport or purchases simply to draw close to the card to a reader.
This year will be sold in the world 460 million cards with uncontakt chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its quota should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units) and represent approximately 10% of the world market of chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been spent in relation to the Asia-Pac region, wins land in the free payment sector.
Approximately 26 million cards Visa are already available for this function, which is accepted in 75.000 payment terminals.
In France, your starts are more modest: you are using 400,000 cards Visa without contact.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2,5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
However, to put the top course, it is necessary that customers provide them.
"There are two large French institutions which have been committed to systematic distribution in the future, among their customers, uncontakt cards," Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
The responsibility tests the payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the future payment means: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication), indispensable to perform transactions.
"They're rejecting."
"But I should finally experience a real growth in the year that comes."
"We should be sold between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 throughout the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the responsibility takes the front.
The agricultural credit announced yesterday the testing between December and next June in Caen.
iPhone will be equipped with about 200 clients and partners with a fund that allows free payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marsella.
And the General Society also yesterday has prepared for the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact to its mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is increasing
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and Boko Haram Section.
The links between the terrorist Al Qaeda group in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect of Boko Haram, which had been understood from a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Viceminister of External Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even suggested that Algel had already "the Certificate".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of the intellectual services show that they are working," he explained, without more details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The research on the two French sequestress in Niger last January would have renewed the passports.
Reported in a Niamey restaurant by persons related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Del日 died next day with several of their followers during a operation launched by French special forces.
In the shops of intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several phone chips belonging to terrorists.
Age terrorist
The study of the calls shows several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
Se ● Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers captured particularly the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who has been a long time in Maiduguri, a city from the north of Nigeria, Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, probably, is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We know since years ago that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is always more active," → Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, those "supports" have been more evident in the evolution and talks of Boko Haram or in its operational ways, which now involve the use of explosives or explosive devices and of the same style as used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, has since then pressed Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities actually have time to consider the group as a community of low worth of interest.
Quick success
In 2002 founded in Maiduguri in a mixture, a school and the fundamentalist imman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, "West Education is a sin"), urges the establishment of a islamic emirate in the north of Nigeria Muslim.
In this poor region, the association is living a quick success.
It is political and requires a strict respect for the sheriff, while its military soldiers are launched to fight against the wicked central government.
These recently are guided first to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram soldiers were especially active and the attacks were multiplied against the Commissioners.
Abuya's reaction was, as it seemed to pass, generalized.
The army attacked the city and were registered 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and leaves its fires from the north.
The past Christmas, revenge an attention that causes 80 dead in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked against Abuya, especially against the protected general court of police, with a selfish attack, the first of this type.
In August, the United Nations local seat becomes its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axe in Africa, which would be shiped from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, concerns all security experts.
While Aqmi attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab's Somalies operate in Kenia, Boko Haram arose as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, in Nigeria, with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned you against Boko Haram and said he was willing to share all the information.
The world is the republican candidates to the Presidency
With regard to China, with Iran and with the help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are simply and missing knowledge.
A American debilitated by the crisis, could a full world be managed with simple ideas or even simplists?
By listening to the Republican candidates for the presidential, electors could think that it is.
Since a few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have made more educational statements and attacks on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republic.
The lemas, often infunded, are extended on China, Iran, the help to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the carrier to the designation by the "Grand Old Party", threatened to bring Chinese to the WHO and declare them "for the manipulation of their division", a key topic in a America exacerbated by the entire fragmentation of its sector to Asia.
Since this involves the explosion of a commercial war, it was deceived.
Jon Huntsman, ancient Obama Embajador in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of the external policy, is almost appealed to a "capbulla" emotions.
You have requested a firm, but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains in the depths of the sodiums, is still inappropriate.
In Reagan style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions are not able to interrupte its nuclear programme.
"If I get out of the choice, I'm going to be Iran," he fanfaroned.
"If Obama is reelected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations in relation to that partner.
Herman Cain, the second best classified candidate, shows, by his part, a confusing ignorance of these subjects.
Recently, he urged to oppose the Chinese military threat because Pekin "intenses developing nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had a military atom since 1964.
The Teayan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, in its part, he is willing to deploy the army and in Mexico to fight drug courts.
The resource to torture against the terrorist assumptions, held by Obama in 2009, also provide Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are significant with the Republican candidate, John McCain, a weight in external policy.
The opposers of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Fry War.
They recall that Obama's own was an affair and that he had to disturb the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They are, in fact, in the failure of their injury dialogue with Iran, in the predicted outcome of the "boys" of Iraq and in their territory in Libya, and they label it weak.
But the attacks are not simple.
The population judges more positively the national security balance of Obama, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he disconfidented military interventions that generate a harm.
And argumenting that it needs economically rebuilding America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more righteous.
North Stream, new Russian Gas input gate in Europe
The North Stream gasoduct, which directly communicates West Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea Fund, has already been served.
Provide gas to satisfy the needs of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas gigant, wanted to celebrate the event with a great pomp.
Last Wednesday, more than 500 invited, including four State and Government Chefs, participated in Baltic areas, between the orchestra music and a delegate bufet, in the invoice of North Stream, the new gasoduct that directly communicates under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Yes, German Canciller Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his homologe of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have joined the volant of the valve controling the Russian gas entry into the Western Europe network.
With this new gas, a year will reach 27.5 million additional Russian gas cubics to Western Europe from a first tent of ↓24 km that communicate the region of San Petersburg with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded at the end of 2012 that will allow a total of 55,000 million cubic gas meters, which is sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, it is already spoken of the possibility of building a third tube for the same depth.
For Gazprom, the finalization at the time of this great work is victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries were firmly opposed to the project.
In fact, North Stream will allow gas to provide directly to Germany, avoiding land transmission by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
These two countries lose something of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia's threat to close access to West Europe's markets.
At the appeal point of the debate, Varsovia did not doubt to compare North Stream as a "new German-Sweden-Sweden covenant", in relation to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the issue is politically deliced.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater supply security.
However, the price is a debilitation of energy Europe, since the project has generated a break between the East and West Europeans.
In only five years, Russia has known to triumph its vision of a direct alien between Russia and the western countries, large gas consumers and with more limited reservations.
"This gaseoduct is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that is organic to us," François Fillon confirmed during the inhibitation of gas, demonstrating to which point the large gas sector contracts are as political as economic.
All this explains the wide smiles in the faces of Gazprom's guidelines, numerous in Lubmin, at the arrival point of gas.
The building of this gaseous gas also provides a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement reserved acid to protect it from the borders of the ships.
It is supported in the foundation of the sea, at a average of 200 m depth.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields given from the Second World War.
"There was needed to remove or destroy a hundred of them by caution," says Jens Mämer, the Porter of the North Stream Society.
Moreover, the protection measures for fauna and flora were necessary.
The tube is a long worm of metal weighting as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by walls nor by maintenance stations.
There was a control platform in Swedish waters, but the responsibles of the project refused to see that Sweden were not very ready to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently in the sea in front of their coasts.
"In case of awareness, we'll stop the step of gas in less than a minute," needs Jens M.
In the case of flight, gas gas will therefore be released to the atmosphere.
But the constructioners consider a little escape, since they have planned jâas that, if the previsions, they will have a fleet every 1000,000 years.
The control of the gas status is guaranteed by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device that is inside the gas.
With the form of a pure, it is introduced within the tube, which has a diameter of a meter, and moves with the gas.
At its arrival, after three full road days at a speed of three metres per second, provides precise data on possible metal deformations.
The gas has been designed to work for fifty years without any type of reparation.
Gas is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At first it's 200 bars and, at the output of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their forces to be able to implement this project.
The leader company is Gazprom, which has 51% of participations.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and exploring gas.
He has his seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the tax is especially favorable.
Gazprom then gained that company, during a period of twenty-five renewable years, the total gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, independent of the quantity of gas that is actually transported," needs Jens Mämer.
The financing of the gas building has been completed by 30% with the contribution of the stakeholders and 70% through loans.
The total cost of the work should achieve EUR 7.400 million for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached the 240 million.
But the minorists are sure that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom only takes the risk of expenditure.
The gasoduct comes from the Baltic in Lubmin, in an aranous coast planted of pinos.
A wall, with 4,5 metres of height, form the gas output door.
There are sensors that measure pressure, temperature and specific features of gas to arrival, before transferring to German gases.
Since Wednesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
The total capacity will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a march book.
Created a half a century ago by a Italian company, Moleskine wants people to enjoy writing.
He has an aventure air, from hours of writing to the light of a wheel.
The Moleskine book is easily recognised, with its black rectangular pastas, its goma, its white wheel sheets, as older for the time.
However, the Moleskine books with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo, based on Milan, decided at that moment to launch a design notes book on the market, but different.
Maria Sebregondi, who then consulted the company, was responsible for the new product.
The book is inspired in an ancient production technology, the skin mole (top pool), which refers to a barriered cow used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was very appreciated by the writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present pleasure an old and vivided object, an icon of the vanguardist artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, which since then became responsible for the mark in Modo Mode.
And it's the success.
Since 2006 and 2010, the sales increased in 26% until a total of 12,7 million sold units.
The confidential production of the first years has remained far, in which only 3.000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notesquarters affect both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, your users are cosmopolites, open spirit and worship.
The small Italian company, which had 12 workers at its starts, has now had approximately 100 and has two offices since 2008: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its quarters in libraries, from Fnac to small trades from the center of the cities, and he has learned to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to time and the need to write, despite the e-mail growth," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature comes from the hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the mark has launched the "Detour" exposure where architects or artists expose their own quarter.
In August, a quarter with leopard tapes, also lan·nʹa, due to the Locarno cinema Festival.
By using your success and this cultural auro, Moleskine has learned to diversify its products: bottles, agendas, boligraphs, computer foundations... The mark has a broad range of support.
A success that causes envidia: in August 2006, Modo was acquisited by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Syntegra Capital, thus written a new page in the Moleskine history.
Why is the rate of paused workers still so high?
Approximately 19% of the disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the employment of disabilities begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, applied since 2005, the rate of unemployment between disabilities doubles the average rate: a 19%, before 9% for the population.
Are you surprising?
"No," E日 Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association organized by the week for the employment of disability.
"The progress achieved since fifty years ago has been significant.
"In that time, the unemployment rate was not two times but three times higher than the average.
"Now, it's still much to do."
It is necessary to mention that unemployment unemployed people are still too many obstacles for employment.
They may have a growing age: 37% has more than 50 years (17% of average).
They put a little high level of qualification: 80% has not finished the bachillerate and, of the 2,3 million students in higher education, only 100,000 are incapacity.
Finally, the long duration pair is very extended between them: 53% for the disabilities, against 38% of the average.
It means, there are many issues that are particularly difficult to return to the work world and that "constitute the problem thing," says Christian Grapin, the Director-General of Tremplin, a partnership created in 1992 to help companies to contract disability workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
Moreover, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people is going, but too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprise association for the City indicated that the questioned directors have "a level of knowledge of low disability" with a "representative representation of persons in road, physical or intellectual deficiencies".
The result: Private enterprises with more than 20 employees are very far from the aim of achieving a 6% of unemployed employees, the objective set out in a ... 1987 law.
The latest available numbers of 2008 are reached by 2.6%.
"Now we go back to 3%," says Pierre Bla日, Director-General of Agefiph, the body responsible for recovering the contributions of companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishments "subjected to this contribution", as well as the amounts of the expense, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, by 59.000 to 46.000 euros (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, which increased the contributions, has generated a great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Bla日.
"But this improvement also reflects a true consciousness, especially among the large groups."
The Ministry of Work is held, only 59% of the companies between 20 and 49 employees are accounted for 82% of the company between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
Once the Bleuss were deceived on Thursday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that generates them this friendly party.
We will not be attracted to say that there was notice of conciliation between them, but the image is yes.
At the street of the stage of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have actually made peace.
Five months after the driving gesture of its front against Turkey, the Belgian elector has no more than elogies for him.
"I am very happy for Eden, for its progress and for Belgium."
"I want to go," answers Lille's front.
As regards the contrast between its presentations in its team and the selection, "is a whole" has been justified.
"In Lille, I'm all the year, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to be."
Convocated to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brill".
We're not going to see the placer.
He was encouraged by the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan."
Without doubt, that will especially strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because "the Matthieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)" will be held.
"We've just just made up a little bit.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made his part reference to "orge".
"Orgullo" for discussing "a gala game."
"Orgullo" also for checking, as "neighbor", that France "never becomes a very high-level team team," about a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blaʹ has done a wonderful work," he said with entusiasm.
While Belgium will not assist the next European competition, the technician would be pleased to be able to fly with the Bleus to... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are growing," he highlighted.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You can see it in the next games." Including the party against France.
Portugal shows much confidence
The Portuguese of Paulo Bento is with a great optimism for the return party against Bosnia (22:00), which will be celebrated on March in Lisbon.
In the ida game, they missed realism on both teams.
"When these 90 minutes passed, we'll be a happy team and, in particular, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the election, which is managed since September 2010, will be qualified for the Eurocope 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate from lucky in Portugal.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to break.
Taking into account the ida party (0-0), Friday at Zenica's district, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than one hour, yes, but he could not mark the valuable goal that he had given him the silence.
"It's a good result, but at the same time I had a risk, because we haven't marked out of the house."
But in the house, at the Â > Light Station of Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before a public that should be equal to enthusiasm, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal," said a optimist but lucid Bent.
"We hope that the party is very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the front," the Portuguese trainer stated 42 years.
"We continue to have 50% of the possibilities to participate in Eurocopa 2012," it has, however, related to Carlos Queiroz' successor.
Wednesday empire in Bosnia forces Portuguese to mark and win.
The boss could reach an empathe, although they also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it's a risk, because we haven't marked out of the house," Bento's regret.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a large individual quality," he added.
Like in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the boss to "not leave them time to think".
A good idea, always if, this time, be realistic.
