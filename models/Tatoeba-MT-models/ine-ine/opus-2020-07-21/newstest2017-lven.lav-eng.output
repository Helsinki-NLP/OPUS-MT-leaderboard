Soonedel on a large-scale roadshop will find death for 28 years a wallet, which recently moved to San Francisco .
But the brother of the victim says that he cannot imagine anyone who wants to overcome his brother, showing, "His end began to improve."
The person who is at Westfild's Grand Task on Thursday was identified as a 28-year San Francisco residence in France, said the representative of the San Francisco Medical Experts Office of San Francisco.
The San Francisco police announced that his death was recognized as a severity and is currently investigated.
The Opura Brother Luis Galicia tells the San Francisco ABC KGO that Frank had been working for the town in Boston, but before six weeks, he believed in his dream restaurant "Sons & Daughters" San Francisco.
The restaurant "Sons & Daughters" representative informs that the news of his death was shocked and disturbed them.

New doctor's street: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors have the opportunity to start protests in the fight against a new contract.
British Medical Association (LMA) New Medical Committee (JAK) has been advised to advise the support of large protests at the beginning of September.
WHAT the ministers believe that they have not been able to make doubts about the contract.
In July, doctors and medical students rejected the LMA offered contract.
The contrary was voted by 58 % of all participants in the vote.
On Thursday evening in the news published by Twitter, the JAK Council member Elena Makkorta shows that the government continues to listen to this issue and therefore the proposal of the contract is a pleasure.
She said, "As regards that the proposal of the vote resulted in the vote is completely willing and decided to provide new formal transactions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's obedience, the IC has officially requested a meeting with the LMA Council today to authorize new contracts entry into force in September.
In the street result, the doctors participated in six streams, including the first time in the NHS history, stopped the work.
After the vote, which would have been proposed to the LMA, the contract conditions recommended by BMA were rejected from the office by the new doctor representative of the LMA Dr. Johans Malawan.
Before meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he said to BMA that the offer was good and accepted.
After voting, Jeremius Hants reported that the contract would come from the doctors of England.
Russia and Turkey: Return Alliance?
The news that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey were on Monday to celebrate and announce the long term and end of the economic penalty war of eight leaders.
However, when Vladimiram Putina contacted the leader of Turkey in the city of Saint-Peterburg, the fact that these partnerships are more needed to Ancar.
Yet, both resulted.
The smile of Vladimira Putina seemed to be a coincidence and did not cause heavy emotions, even taking into account his depression.
Instead, the vision of Taijips Erdogan was at least five times sent by Putin for his "d'go friend", a review of the meeting.
I wanted the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only be improved to the pre-Christ level, but become even stronger.
On the next day, a timer reported that Erdogan would make it like nothing would happen.
I think his enthusiasm was a contrary feeling.
However, from Putina, the stakeholder shows that the Russian leader is nothing behind.
The first time he mentioned his talk was the Russian aircraft to the Syrian border.
At that time, Mascava reacted to axis.
Putin accused Ankara that he built the dance in the Mouse of Moscow.
The survival was still more painful, taking into account that it came from a friend’s side.
Refreshing true loyalty will be difficult, even impossible.
The position of Russia has been changed since November.
The Government's controlled television has extended agresive accusations against Ankara.
It seemed that there was a guilty of the Turks.
In the most serious case, there were claims that Erdogana gained profits from illegal oil trade with the Islamic State control · Syrian part.
He himself, of course, lost it.
However, the main message of SanktPeterburg's meeting that the time will come after the past.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin adopted the chairman Erdogan's excuse.
Russia could consider it as a victory of her kind.
Ancars benefit from the peace agreement.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after an ineffective consideration in the past, where he was born.
The unreadable terrorist attacks have also disturbed its powers.
There is also a economic motive.
Russian sanctions have caused basic losses, it is a charter behind, which usually provides a number of million Russian tourists in the creation of Turkey.
The number of tourists was reduced by 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies have also been facilitated when regular aircrafts are renewed.
They hope for the department in the Mediterranean season.
Today, national TV provides a decrease of the prices of fruit and vegetables since the imports of fruit and vegetables of Turkey have been renewed.
As in the other time, Wedmosti said, "Turists to them, to us."
However, there were other political faces from Maskva.
Ankara is anxious to the Western about, their opinion, the weak reaction to the evaluation genetic.
In all, it can also be considered uncomfortable with the income negotiations on the EU and Putina intervention, which please use the ability to turn Turkey away from the Western.
The Russian leader of the Ankar's eye has uncertainly received additional points, expressing support to its electoral government after consideration.
Take into account that Moscow understands it, because there are deep intimidated fears from the country of change.
The seed that solved in this rapid sea town gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present as a analytical, "sustained alians", two countries who feel away from the West, together.
However, despite the unity of demonstrators, both remains awareness.
The main unconformity of Syria, where Russia presents himself as no peace, but Russia and Turkey actually supports the opposite parties.
After more than three hours of starting negotiations, both Presidents in Press Â announced that they had not discussed this issue.
The Turkish president was aimed at avoiding the issues of both recents, but President Putin wanted to recognize them.
There is no consensus how both countries could find languages in Syria.
However, after long-term reports, the employment has been renewed to the negative relations and potential disasters when the NATO member of Turkey has found a Russian carrying aircraft is better because both leaders have at least restarted the negotiations.
Scotland Royal Bank will no longer be available to customers by Scotland
The SKB will continue to support the role of the bank's executive director.
There will be no longer available outside Scotland SKB.
Ross Makevan relates to BBC channels in Scotland that the SKB mark was associated with bank ambitions globally.
It has rejected these ambitions, since eight years ago the bank was bankrooted and it was a financial assistance.
The experts of the signal management strategy have used a SKB signal to protect other consumers' financial characters.
Bank adopted millions of mariners from international sport sponsors, starting with the six-National region and finally with Vimbledon's tennis Endi Murey.
But now it is decided to make other national signs in the preplane.
Scotland King Bank will be available to Scotland clients, but it will not be initiated.
In England and Vels, all SKB references, on the side of the main office and official office, will be changed to the name of NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already used in the Republic of Ireland and North Ireland.
Now there will also be less private financial signs, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Makevan was interviewed during the choice with clients and Property by Inverneshire.
He highlighted the BBC Scotia channel: "SKB will become a sign of our investors and work for us, because we now become more than a signal bank."
In time, the bank himself became a global sign and the SKB became a global sign.
Now I say we have no global ambition anymore, we have a measured ambition.
Each of these signs will represent something unique in its sector and our employment will work with customers under these marks.
The SKB has already announced that it would not continue sponsoring "Seven nations" and will have different signs in sport sponsoring.
"And is the right time to become a signal bank, because we have already asked ourselves how to become better banks to our customers?", says the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been nice if we would notice that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these signs.
However, thanks to the hard work and focusing on customers' needs, not for our own needs, we have clearly made great changes.
We can repeat these signs, so I think it's the right time now.
Francis Detori wins 3000 wins, entering the first place in New City with Zirk Predilection
Detori resorts shampanites, purchasing their 3000 wins twice, finishing the first statement in New York.
On the fifth day, John Frankie Detori excited his 3000 wins in the history of the United Kingdom, entering the first place in New York.
He achieved it by curing the second win in these stories that happened in his birth city, with the predilection trained by John Gosdens.
45-year Italian is the sixth shooter, which has reached the results in the screen screen.
He has joined Seram Gordon Richards, Dougam Smitam, Lester Pigotam, Peter Edery and Willy Carson.
The three-party Champions shooter Detori, who wined before with the Zirk Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm disappointed because I'm here.
I'm glad that this happened in New York because I've lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big statement, it is not a King Ascot, but it is usually a fifth night with 20,000 people.
I'll feel easy and thankful.
The Detori and Predilection will be expected to be acquired by the ships and receivers.
Two shoes have reached this record in the storages with a shorch-Champions Richard Johnson and a carrier's 20-year-fifth champions Sers Antonio Makkoy, who set a number of records in his career, curing more than 4300 wages.
Lester Pigots, nine-fold derby wins, in carrying 4493 wins.
Frankie is one of the best shoes today and there is no surprise that he is a guy of the ability that only rarely reaches.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactic feels his own of the other shoes.
He's a fantastic speaking representative, his enthusiasm and Harrism for years connected fans to this type of sport.
A few weeks ago in Epsom's stories, I told Frankie that he would have been stuck for 6000 wages if they were not solely shared in weekly feet and in big stories.
However, when speaking seriously, it is a real joy that France has been acquired of a 30-year-old regulation in the United Kingdom's statements.
He is happy, who is greatly interested in the British talks, where he is a great joke.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with the sign of his company - a flighting offence.
From the end of the wind to the aircraft, Frankie Detori has been a britain's speech for 20 years.
This was a full road of life.
He has gained a large story, including the celebration of 1996 of the "Small Seventh" in Askot, where he survived aircraft accidents and discharges for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he was difficult to return after the six-leaving dishing, but he demonstrated his characteristics, expressing those who doubted him, returning to his best form.
And he could share in sayings another time - Detori said before that it would be well-continued to say to at least 50 years of age.
The Russian President Putin releases Sergej Ivanov's administration leader
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has no longer released the director of the administration of Sergei Ivanovu.
Ivan was found in the nearest place of the people for many years.
Currently, an elderly politician has been appointed as a special representative for natural and transport matters.
The notice of the cream states that Putin has decided to release Ivanovu from the Government of the Russian President, without the reason.
Anton Vaino, who was his website since 2012, was designed at Ivanova.
The 44-year-old Vano has lost a diplomatic.
It was born in 1972 in the capital town of Estonia, which was repeatedly prestigiated by the International Relations Institute of Maskva (MVSAI) and later worked in Tokyo’s news.
As a letter to Kremla's homepage (russian), he later led the President's Protocol and Government's administration.
After his name, he said to Putina, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the main work of the administration is to support your work at the national president's office, making laws and controlling the implementation of your decision.
On the fifth day, Ivanov told a Russian railway that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his office and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Are we sure that we're sure?
This stage is the mask.
Sergej Ivanov is a sense and nearby Vladimira Putina associated and, as Putin, worked at the VDK Council Security Service.
At this time, he was one of the most influenced men in Russia.
At the second seat of the national television, both men announced that Ivanov was declined from the office after starting.
But despite the cameras that have been shot, it is not the case that the claim is confirmed, especially before Parliament's elections.
Is that outside what is ́t fighting for power?
No one knows that.
However, the official claim that a man, who was considered as a possible president, was quickly wanted to become a leader of the Russian environmental policies, is found with a great scrupule.
In the notes published in the cream page Ivanov says to Putina: "This is the fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to trust this complex matter, even if I could say, problem attitude, four years.
It showed that I had worked four years and eight years in this field.
Ivanov entered into force in December 2011.
Previously, he was Prime Minister and Minister for Protection.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former VDK Security Service, as well as Putin.
At the end of 1990, Putin led the Federal Society Service, which is the success of the VDK, adopted the office of his website.
When Putin came to the authority, he called Ivanova in the number of five people who were most trusted.
At the end of the second time Ivanov was considered the potential candidate of the Russian President, since the transfer of Putina to the third term would be anticonstitutional.
However, at that time, the president became another closer to Putina - Dmitry Medvedevs.
Putin became a Prime Minister, and after three and half years, the president returned.
Miclaine fishing in a d'zz in Banfas City
One man from Banfa asks help to deteriorate the conditions of the fish’s species in Banfa’s damage.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be a smiling suck that went away with water station .
Mr. Bein, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, the Spanish fishing video in Periscope, hopes that someone can know how these 5 centimeters of big fish have passed in his d'az.
Kwinsferia crossing: the pool is now connected to Faif.
Currently, 1,35 billion billion valuation projects are planned to finish in May 2017.
The engineers have joined the north part of the Queensfera crossing, which means that the pool is now connected to Fafa.
The first of the four associated ds has been completed, meaning that the building of the pool is close to the conclusion.
Fafa's strength is 600 metres long and over 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of wheat, 20 000 tonnes of beton and 46 tonnes of support.
Currently, 1.35 billion billion valuation projects are planned to finish in May 2017.
The Economy Secret of Keith Braun has gone to the building today and was one of the first ones who came to the pool.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historical moment in the building of the Kwinsfera Pool."
In this project we have an inappropriate engineering solution, where only these parts are used for more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and tree.
Despite the massive weight and size of the powder, the weight and the vidust combination is a delegated process where n is a significant precision.
In general, more than 79% of the tissue has already been built and the last stage associated with Rositis will be income today, which means that all parts of the pool are incoming.
Michael Martins, director of the Fourth Station Project, says: "The first connection is an important point for any ship in any way."
The first connection in this fantastic project demonstrates the approach of the higher class engineerb.
After setting up the last phase of the road and joining it with the North Tower support, we left to join the northern road stage with a part of the earth or a transduct.
This was made by the northern trailing part of the 700 miles [700 km] southward.
It was a great and simultaneous delegate operation.
A mild, since the transplant is 222 metres long, it is about 6000 tonnes, and it was necessary to overcome the sleeps of approximately 3 %.
The delegate, because it was locked in both directions the command was only a few milimetres.
Congratulations, everything has been released.
Simon Bails enters the golden vinger for women.
He's just trying.
Include the incidence.
Simon Bails, that's not everything.
Dynamics.
Without an effort to carry out vinger on the balcony.
Insufficient on the wheel.
It's totally unfoundable.
And at the end of the Olimpic Champion.
Thursday, 19 - year - old victory was highlighted by the golden medal, fullly demonstrating the skill between himself and the rest of the world on the ambition.
Its total number of points was 62.198 too higher than the consequences of med and its orders of Alias Raismanes and bronze meat profited the result of the Russian sportist Alias Mustafin.
Thursday, the US sportist Simona Bailsa has made a vinger on the Baltic Sport Vintage for individual female final women in the Olympical Games of 2016 in Riodejaneiro, Brazil.
Bailha became a quarter of the trip, which had gained a lot of champions and the fifth best winners, reduced the reputation as the best winner of her generation and possibly in the best story of the winners.
When the final outcome was announced, she fell into the ashes, because the long journey to this time was ended.
This achievement is to bring them near such unsuccessful sports like Michael Felps, who has led his sports type to another level.
The last three years of the bail has dominated in its sports, instondo 15 metes in the world campionates, including 10 golden meat, and performing so excellent, precise and ambitional vinger combinations that in 1984 Mary Lu Retone called him "the best vinger that he ever had."
In Brazil, she was expected by the last trial where she had to focus on the hopes that remained on her, not on other sports.
She would get a vacation if she returned to her home in Spring, in Texas without gold med.
The United States sportsist Simona Bailsa (left) and Alija Raismane are discovered accordingly by gold and grass of med med in the individual number of final women in Olimpiadad of 2016 in Riodejaneiro, Brazil, which resolved Thursday.
The first golden medals of Bails got on Monday, making special co-ordinators of Marta Karolji a ballet.
Besides Bails stated that in his long way to the glorious surfaces there was nothing in expectation, but that is not the truth.
A part of her predecessor's free movement, which includes its special acrobic transition, leads the latin music that is greatly inside the street near Rio Olimpisko game arena.
It's not an end.
A girl, adopted by her grandparents when she was still a young man, who returned the trainer of Emiy Burman's mother at the sports room, where the Bürman's terninini, has now become a ́s to be counted.
She hasn't lost multicasts since February 2013 and a series of wins can continue as long as Bailsa wants it.
While Mustafin's two rotation was a little in the direction, it was only illusion.
Littleswad Balk and free movement - part of the accuracy, where Bailsa will stop his chappie title, is still in front.
She was in front of the result of 15,433 on the balcony and strengthened the management of the result 15.933 in the free movement
Raismane was stumbled with her while waiting for the results, which were just formality, and she expelled joy in the ashes when the dream that she had ever entered in the book of her comments.
Raisman’s result was like a small extent of four years old when he shared the third place with Mustafin, but he lost the battle for bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old Captain of the committee, named "vicmamine", has been assured by the leadership.
After the free movement of the snow, she was able to take the air into a nice effort.
For 19 years of Bails' viral Twitter inscription, which she published this week, it is already a completely different importance.
6 years old Mahai Braun's "soil" lived in trouble in Philadelphia.
Police reported that a six-year-old boy believed in Filadelfia, showing that he was the second six-year-old man who was called in Philadelphia today.
Children's older CBS Philadelphia's news channel's that this is Mahai Brauns.
The elders say that Brown was gathered several times, including in the circle, in the foot, in the hand and in the wheat, but still was at the mouth when he brought him to the church.
His older Deloresa Melendeza tells the television, "His little body was simply locked."
I couldn't do that.
The area in critical area is inside the church and has already overcome several operations.
Family informs that he will certainly come back.
He had to begin to go to the first class in the basic school.
Brown is one of the four people with the town of Jermantown.
There were also three men: two 29 years old men and a 32 - year - old man.
CBS Filadelfia channel reports that one of the 29-year-old men is critical, but the other two severe stage is stable.
The channel message that the child was found at the front seat of the car nearly 29 - year - old critical stage.
The other two prisoners did not find in the car, and the police investigated whether one of them had been arrested.
Research reported to the CBS Filadelfia channel that most of the most probably have been threatened.
Instead of the event, weapons are found in the arms of the patrons, which belong to different weapons.
It seems to be a long-term threat.
On both sides of the guy's sides, they've found the bullets.
"It seems that there were several armed men who participated in anxiety here," says the Philadelphia police captain Antonio Ginaldi.
Difficulties were also made for several houses and cars.
No one has been stopped and reported that the police checks the records of the cameras.
On Sunday, when the ship was thrown into a six - year - old girl’s hand while she moved before her home in the Westouklein region.
She's getting better, but the police's still looking for a guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby and Laurie?
I call it for a number of reasons for the Year Olimpic Vieglatl Command of Women.
First, I've been on all the Olympics games of February since 1984, and the US command is never so good.
Second, in this order there are three facilities, Simon Bails, Gabia Duglas and Lauria Hernandeza, which were built in many young girls of origin.
Humans may be nice that these commands are also Alija Raismane, who is the Jewish and Medison Kociana, who are Catholic.
Finally, this order is really representative of America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American sportists in this sport.
The best winner in the last four years is a African originate.
In the past year, Simon and Gabia took places 1 and 2.
They are impressive results.
The previous Olimpic games of Gabia Duglas surprisedly became the Olimpisko Champion, and America was lyxed.
Now the world has done unbelievable vingerships which have been fulfilled three times in the world's campion Simon Bails, Duglas and Lauria Hernandez, conducting unexpected but magical wine.
Thursday, Simona became the fourth officers after a trip of golden medals in the individual majority of women.
Its order Alija Raismane gained a medal inflammation.
We have done the best that this sport can be given, but the rest of the country is completely different at the hours of vintage.
Simona, Gabia and Lauria entered the empire reading as Alija and Medison.
They're the Olympical Prince, because the Olympical Vintage Command will only be four sports, and this is the trener of Marta Carola's last year in the training work.
In fact, winning is a d'g sport. Vingrottai mainly trends in private facilities clubs, and keeps them to pay for trains, rooms, travels, trains, hotels, trainers, sports and other expenditures.
The majority of this lightlet club seems in cities that can allow this sport.
In these clubs, sports transfer all their trends, and it is a dgg and long investment in the lighting generations.
Eimija Burman - Simon Bails trener and Megija Hainia - Lauria Hernandeza trener has trained their sportists since both girls began to work with a lightletletic.
We need to protect new girls who have encountered Simon, Gabia and Lauria, the opportunities for the late vintage trends.
I've designed my lightletletic organization 20 years ago.
My organization is in Hâle, and we offer more than 15,000 youths in the town (of most black and Spanish origin) winning trends without a low price or a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will return to the officers in Detroit (in my birth city) to ensure that youths have the opportunity to recognize this great sports type.
The viglatetic has developed coordination of →, loan and body, and has also learned hard work, discipline and provision for purposes.
This combination provides a long time with good health and training at school and at work.
In this order, thousands of young girls are trained in a light-lethic, and it is fantastic.
Working with this sports type is important, especially for new girls.
This is a terrible time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabia and Medison for the great demonstration of the "Freeting of Children" demonstration, including Olimpisk golden meat and motivating unlikely new, different original girls to become healthy, strong and successful new women.
After the refusal of Jeremy Hanta's offer, the doctors plan to make more streaks.
The Ministers hoped to end the opinion by setting into agreement on changes in the Treaty with the representatives of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37 000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hants notified plans from the contract, showing that the NHS seems to be in the stage and the further deterioration only for the damage and patients.
The first-year doctors have already signed a new contract which provides changes in the conditions of work night in changes and weeks in order to improve work conditions at standard work hours.
This evening, Dr. Elena Makourta reported that the new doctors still have a serious fear of the contract offered, especially that it would intensify the working crisis and that it did not fit the same conditions to all doctors.
The remaining eight weeks until the first new doctor group signs a new contract, it is therefore necessary to progress because there is no longer a long time.
The BMA's efforts to solve problems in the way of negotiations have been contacted with the government's failure to intervene and sometimes with complete obedience.
This happened despite the fact that Jeremies Hants said that his door is always recognised in the past.
Jeremi Hantam must be arranged immediately , stop inactivity and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he doesn't do it, the young doctors have new protests.
At the end of April, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were carried out in the end of April, while the sisters and advisers were able to replace the doctors who had been given in the picet.
The Ministers hoped to end the opinion by setting an agreement on changes in the Treaty with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to divide the rate for work weeks to kill 54 000 new doctors with the treaty contracts.
The NHS Executive Director Daniel Mortimer invited new doctors to not be stuck.
Mr Mortimera believes that the streak does not solve anything, but only pressure on the insults and takes it up, creates stress and crafts for patients, for the envelopes and for their families.
In the last two reports, we have spoken to the new doctors committee, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have answered positively their issues on the issues of members and reporters.
Workers hope that cooperation in other important issues, such as deployment, flexible training, additional training to those who return after carrier interruption, training costs, training programmes, recognition, loss of studies and gender inequality - shows that workers, English health education authorities and the Ministry of Health are seriously seeking to make agreements from November, February and May.
Medicinal risks for 2 m per day may be risked.
Thousands of patients who have a heart strike may be treated with medicines for 2 m daily, since official representatives recommend them to use more and more people and longer.
Ticagrelor’s pre-treated medicine reduces the recycled heart strike risk of humans with heart diseases.
This medicinal product is already written to use 12 cardiovascules by reducing the recycled heart strike risk.
The NHS representative NICE recommends to use this medicinal product for 4 years after cardiovasculars in order to increase the heart strike risk of people with heart and blood chain problems.
However, in the NHS translation there is NICE recommends to use this medicinal product for 4 years after cardiovasculars to increase the risk of heart and blood cardiovasculars.
Each year, about 140 000 people in England live in a heart strike, and the fourth part of them is a repeated heart strike or insulin.
Insults and heart strips were drawn into the walls by creating discharges.
If the dilution flows, it can result in a trombo, blocking blood flow on the heart and breathing the heart strike.
However, if the tromb is separated from the bloodwater wall, it can be reached in the blood street and block the blood access to the thrombosis by infarct.
People who have a heart strike are subject to a higher renewable risk of heart strike.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed with the name Brilique, reduces the risk of trombose creation.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor 12 days and more than 3 years per 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longsona's health technology NICE's director says: "Although there is a renewable medication, more than a quarter of people who have a heart strike, there is another heart strike or insulin that often have serious consequences."
Repeated heart strikes may have a negative impact on human quality.
The evidence shows that in the combination of Ticagrelor with aspirin effects, the renewable heart stripes and infare risks of people who have already experienced it.
Provisually, in the treatment with Ticagrelor, we are happy that we can expand the possibilities of treatment to thousands of people who have thus benefited.
Taking into account the limited information on the efficiency and efficiency of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of hepatitis using this medicine for more than three years, the guideline project does not recommend to use it more than this period.
Political correction culture promotes the promotion of the election in muslim communities
The former majority of the Tauerhamlet city of Lutfur Rahman was released from the office in relation to corruption.
The Government report reveals that the result of the political rights culture is recognised in the broad dimensional research in the communities of Muslims.
The former Minister of Government Sers Eric Pick criticizes the police, election, and citizens' advice that they ignore the election of the signs of development in the process of "free to protect ethnic and religious interests".
The former secret of the communities, which now has become the leader of the anti-corruption organization, states that the invitation of electors is so extended for religious reasons that the police should be allowed to deal with a guardian at election stations in order to protect the invited electors.
He also recommends that the electors should show a person's evidence document when they vote in order to demonstrate their true identity.
Only name and address must be shown by the voters at this time.
He even recommends to mark voting bodies with special tickets in order to prevent double voting.
The scientists also need to protect greater protection, says Sers Eric.
He considers that the press should ensure greater access to the documents and decisions of the Council adopted by the non-official Committees and Working Groups.
He says, "The purpose is not just to determine the desires, but to protect the government from the low corruption and cultures that are in hand with it."
The Dauningstrit has sent a knowledge after a scandal related to the choices of the city of Tauerhamlet.
In the past year, the Special Election Court decided to revoke the town scale of Lutfur Rahman from the city because of corrupt and illegal functions.
The Court concluded that Rahman had "linearly conceived" the religious view of his Muslim community and claimed his critics by accusing them of racism and islamofobia.

How to protect yourself from swimming weapons using Kqua Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little more possible.

Then the seat follows the road through the circle, and as he gets the pain, takes his weapons, goes through the street of the weapons and goes away, continues to wipe the weapons against it.
If he gets near, the employment is similar - should be avoided from one tragedy, the weapons should be shut down and it must be removed so that the host cannot be thrown.

Do you hear complicated?
See the video to see how Mizraki does it.

In this case, a number of factors should be assessed because this property will not be a good reputation in Cornvol.
This is slave and their name is known.
The other was three sons who periodically maintained their property and the police said that their terrors were expressed as a violence, the gateway of the busball news, the invitation of the people, the use of drugs, the sale of drugs and the clouds and the laughing.

More exhibited households have been located in decades.

The dismissed neighbors were happy for the extinction, because they were absolutely absolute.
One said, "They didn't have any other people."
We lived to them for about 20 years, it was always crazy.
I'm unbelieving how often we've hit the police here.
We couldn't have been stuck.
We're mourning because we've been so crazy here - we haven't done it!
Now, when they end, they will be wonderful here.
Adams Fitzpatrik, who is the leader of the Neighbourhood of Cornvola, said that he did not cooperate with security authorities.
Family lives here for 20 years and here is a policy.
The house behind the d'ocean was found in various old and small objects.
He also said, "It's sorry that the irnists did not have any responsibilities for their conduct, because the release from the house is always the last step that Kornvola's Majockles service."
This was a difficult case, since their conduct was extreme and the neighbors were hard to see their conduct.
I have a work that is involved in this matter by all my order, Devona and Cornvola Police and members of the municipality, who were courageous and cooperated with us by providing information.
I hope that this event will facilitate the neighbours and show that anti-social conduct is not acceptable.

The president who left the ene: Gustava Tergal - 145.
Thursday, on 12 August, the second president of Latvia was born 145 years since the second president of the state of Gustavs Zemgal.
The land was proclaimed by the country of Latvia, but it has not been forbidden to describe the first Latvian president Chakste and the last pre-committee of the Presidency of Karl Ulman.
No one of our citizens has stopped the democracy and justice as the earthgale, which is issued in the book of Gustava Landgal, which was published ten years ago, in the book of Arnolds Auziņ.
Conversation with the Portal "Delfi" Auzinš stresses that the earth is one of the high-country politicians who feel humor.
Others are like that, always right.
He taught not to be such, today it could be like Raimond Winni.
"He was the one who was near the people," says August.
Today's political politicians know badly the stories, they refer to Karli Ulmani as a good leader, but just who knows how negative he was.
The only man on whom he was not called was general Balodis.
Even if in his images he is good and smiling, he was histerical.
"The earth with its humor feeling and democracy leaves the opposite impression," says August.
Latvia's University History and Philosophy Faculty Professor Aivars Stranga talks with "Delfi" agrees to the Earth Value of Earth as a peaceful and disgusting public.
He also notes that the Earth has come up with respect to minorities and has invited the Jewish representatives to the Chairman's pile.
"In that time, it was not an action that, after the Presidency of the Earth, Albert Kwiesis took these traditions," says the historian.
He was such a loud and honest man who has been coming to be a president for a long time.
He himself did not follow it, but he simply did not give glory.
He also critically appreciated himself because he didn't know French, but believed that the President had to understand it.
"In the presidency, the foundations of French languages have been learned," Stranga.
The earth was not able to be renewed to candidate, but he did not have a very high amates.
In the meantime, he has a honourable person in the history of Latvia, before the president's arrival was seriously in the town - he was at the neighborhood.
Earth also guided the glorious earthquake in Suvorov, in the hall 3 of Suvora, where the ability of the leaders and the employees was to become the country of Latvia.
He was always progressed.
It was not great in Ulman's respect, but it did not even imagine him.
"Private negotiations have sometimes said that the Ulman's activity is incompatible with him," Stranga said.
It lived peaceful forever, no interest in illegality or corruption.
How does the Earth Remember Today?
He was a great part of his association with a race of Rīga.
He was an absolute democrate, thinking was central.
"In his time there were no big troubles, which could be associated with a real stabil presidency," reputs Stranga.
During the Presidency of Gustava Termgala, from 1927 to 1930, the visited Latvian State was also addressed in Sweden, which was in the meantime of Latvia’s total recognition in the Neighbourhood and included the link of the Northern European Democratic Nationality.
On 28 May 1929, the land was visited in Stockholm.
The visit to Gustava V of the Kingdom of Sweden was held in Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second Latvian national president was born in 1871, but forever went in January 1939.
Only ways to help the child get out of anger.
I often feel about that the wrath of the child, the advantage of the gentleness, considers something wrong and unusual.
When the child shows his wrath -- we don't know how to respond, "Econet" shows the Jekaterin Kes psychologist.
The Specialist encourages a little negotiation about these so natural and human feelings - the wrath and the niceness of each one periodically.
Agression - it is already a physical activity that is addressed to others, and it usually shows when we feel angry.
When we're upset, we're wrathful, we're stuck - usually know what's going on with us and how to end it.
We can express our wrath and niceness to ourselves: express, press, hide, keep ourselves, tell our friends or other neighbors, we can make anger of the dust, call cigarettes (that is not the best way of wrath calling!), enter two, go in with a bowl on the board and do other things we usually do.
We do not face our aggression against others, because we know different ways to end these emotions.
Children do not understand what happens to them, how they are called and how to live with them.
They can say, "Oh, yeah!", You're a bullet, "Soul mom," "I don't care for you," "I'm with you."
Children live burtically, they seem to be completely here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and real in their feelings, and often seems to be different in the face of emotions.
It is important that children do not want to show feelings, including wrath, disappointment for it and irritation, but otherwise - to help the child.
Do you need to be paused in relations?
The day of the spirit work, where you're not going to see how you're still, or just a bad decline - there's so many reasons why you're still going to go for a time, day or even longer "after" from all the world.
Is it possible for a moment to put along with the relationship and to put a little in mind?
Does that, though, show that each partner is going to his way?
In your view, gentlemen share in different years.
(23) is nice and irrelevant: "If the relationship is needed, you should not be with the right person."
The Eduard (30) has repeated a scheme that may be helpful.
If you feel that a partner starts Christian you in nerves for each less interest, then it's the right time when you'd have to put other material fields in order to get out, or you're missing it, or especially about it's uncertain, or even unnecessary to put them in place.
So the answer is - should, the suspension can help to get time and understand how important you have the other side.
Kaspar (29) rejects his theory.
I think the relationships should be taken on one of the other day, because if you take time with human 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the fight is unrefugiated.
They were expressed by the fact that each other’s incidence, and it begins Christian in nerves.
People begin to deceive one another, it is themselves, even if there is no more to talk about what you have done, only about what you have done on the day.
My personal advice is to think that, so I have no longer maintained my relationship than a few days.
If you sometimes think that anywhere or at the other is better - then why is this woman with whom you are together, who can think that there's no enough and there's a paradise field behind the mountains?
The idea is just a small league.
If not, then it's not.
"I have, so I'm just gonna put a little to those who don't." Edmund (46).
Karlim (33) has a complete opposite view.
I think everyone needs a time for a call.
You can't be able to see each one of you, all the time, from the morning to the evening, looking at each other's eyes, and looking like a loving love.
Attopies!
There's so many things - friends, jobs, ballits.
It's all your time.
Of course, even for a woman or a wife, however, if both are able to keep them equal to the other world, it can live up to the cab.
That's just that.
Mpostin (27) says, "Gut to say - need or unfair, can or cannot take it, but one is - its proposer has something to be related to the end, something is missing."
If this question comes out, it must be calculated that in the nearest time there will be a change - to the good or bad side, it depends on itself.
I think while you're still new and slow, you're still delayed - sometimes, but when everything remains serious and you're going into a different phase, there can't be no discouragement.
But you're determining the whole life together!
"If you can't be able to keep one another and once again, what will be when you're going to be a pension, which comments as long-term cats or strikes about the day you'll be better driven," said Christaps (19).
All the words of the gentlemen have been changed.
With his emotional and emotional personality, Rosental first prayed to the Latvian people’s interests for the artists.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which will remain indefinitely unforever," he wrote about Latvian older Jani Rosental at the time of Romans Suta.

German researchers discuss the number of "Berlin Mountains" victims.
The number of injuries incoming communists may have been much greater than the previously considered, but there is no doubt about the number of victims.
The data given to the Berlin Wall Museum for Thursday, checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, to the border of the west associated areas and to the later 1841 people of the Western community official authorities, who were deceived to get out of their controlled territory.
Museums with border death cases have been investigated for years and adjusted the number of victims at a time.
Another 11 cases of death have been added to this year, including between victims, including a six-year-old boy, who wants to arrive in Western Germany through the Toxicity of Czech Slovakia and Hungary.
Along with the new Berlin wall sacrifices, there are also advised military desserteries.
"The valid amount of damage made by double communism and socialism poverty has not yet been completely documented," recognises the Museum Director Alexandra Hildebrante.
"Our assignment is to make the heads of those who were lost, trying to escape from the communist controlled country, to be gathered and not lost," he urged in the Hildebrance's broadcast statement.
However, other researchers have already doubted the new numbers.
"Scaitle 1841 is uncertain," in the Interview of Southdeutsche Zeitung states the historical expert of the Eastern University of Berlin Brothers.
He, together with other researchers at the University of Berlin, is currently reviewing the possibility of suspicious death at the border, and until then they will only approve 260 cases.
Earlier, researchers claimed that only at Berlin’s Wall communists had 138 people.
Taking into account those who were lost, trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to escape Westernly through the neighborhood territory, stately, the number of victims could reach approximately thousands.
However, this is equally less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the number of victims could be important methodology.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also calculates all cases of self-security of Eastern Limitation, independent of whether they have been . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Museum also calculates cases of death which have not been affected by violence.
"If the elderly in the age of 70 to 80 years after negotiation with border control dies from the heart strike," it must be the results of these "slepka's borders", it considers Hildebrante.
However, the State is convinced that it should be done from the existence of older wicked ones who may have died in the result of their changed circumstances, and to those who died in a long-term expectation during the warm bus at the border.
The accounting of its victims is not easy, since the Communist Authority of Austria did not comply with such data and the investigators should select the documents in the various archaeological archives, reported by the State.
However, the State Group has recently received new documents, so it may be in the nearest time in the case of a new number of sacrifices.
President LPF Pone to Rio Devies with the trainer's acreditation; it's surprising.

After the Federation of Uvia, the trainer entered her to help her.
Sir, who is a member of the LOK executive committee, asy criticized the operation of the LOK, with the delay of the wine to the Olimpic Sport Surveillance Organization.
In my view, the LOK in the executive committee has not been able to approve five persons and one of them is not exempted.
"I don't know why the Pelding Federation did not have places," Mr. said that the work of the Federation and their presidents was in principle, by repealing that the President of the Federation did not receive the tasks.
Also, Pone criticized himself Jacobovski, knowing that before London's empire games, when Ribakova was not approved between participants, he was with acknowledged in the International Water Sport Federation (F). He invited Latvia to not send any sportist.
Mrs couldn't even tell why he had the empotic games with the trend's acreditation, which probably needed to be at Jakubovski.
"I was requested as the President of the Federation (the team leader) but because of an unknown reason, I received the acreditation of the trainer and now no one's going on."
The situation changed every day, changed the number of accredements available.
I thought Germans would be for the last time because I had no other information.
According to the Agency, there are information in the Agency, a few days before Ribakovs started her bi-conferences against ace with Mri and after its player with asses, however, the chairman of LPF suggested that it would be a everyday negotiation with a desire to assemble sports before the start.

Greece is involved in the rabbi-7 series of rabbies, when the Fiji State unit is designed with gold.
The impressive presentation of the United Kingdom at the rabbi-7 series ended Thursday at the final stage of Deodoro Rio Fiji, the State unit, with the results 43:7, was overlooked.
Fiji demonstrated the master class in the management of the bubbles, the bubbles played with the foot, the support game and the brutal game, curing the gold - the first olympical medals in the history of their stay.
The saquive brought a precious mixture ball - a tree medal that was at the time of the Great Britain's three medal. The British exhibition can be stuck with its performances in the first-impic regby-7 tourist, where they built New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the middle of the battle, where Boks commanded to be thrown with the Result of 7:5 days on the first side, may have played to British finally.
But in any case, Fiji's reading is now the best form to win a 15-man command.
In fact, we have little faith, however, a well-known feeling for British might have the fact that at least one British profited the golden medal. This is Fiji's main trener Ben Raiens - the former English trener from Vimbledon.
For British, it was a terrible survival.
Eight years ago, in the lead of Rayne, they lost all the games regby-7 series in Adelaid.
Now they lost only one game.
The story is painful, but the excitement is surprising.
Fidji started the shot with an impressive start of the britain's advice after.
Captain Tom Michelam and § it was as a combination with several opposite buses and the world series champions were held in the direction of 5:0, when Osea Colonisau gained the first survival.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwa also increased the survival by carrying up the surface in the good corner.
Repository 12:0 and the British command was not even actually disturbing the bubble.
The great approach of Michela was not allowed to get three points to the building Leoni Nakaram, but it only affected a little Fiji's result.
Games in the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua gained the survival in the good street, enhanced the survival of Britain up to 17:0.
After the overshop of Nakarava increased the survey, and until the end was more than a minute... the first half-time end.
The Vatemo Ravou avoided some ineffective British adoptions and scrolled the line, at the same time, points.
The survival protected the results 29:0.
It seemed that Fidji was born to play regbia-7 in the walls until the British still learned.
In fact, it is also the court.
The British team made basic changes at the middle of the middle, watching the Fiji player line... full of four minutes after the first half-time standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic command, had some more points in the way of Fiji's command.
Den Norton went out to get a point in the good way of the British command, performing the landscape in the left side and by the result 36:7, but the game was already lost, while the South Sea island fan sing, called carogs and laid it in tribes.
It can't be surprised that Fiji's rejoicing attitude.
Mother Williame made Fidji a more swimming win with another survival game at the end of the game.
Recovering the end of the games, Fiji could start swimming, but British can only be seated in the medical.
In the first half of the day, Fiji established Japan with a result 20:5, but the British were too higher than the South African, where the two commands in his battle gained for the battle and the South Africans lost only for some points.
In the first half of the middle, Kails Brauns made Boks commands, but in the second half of Dens Norton, with a mystery, shoot the line and the boom between the stairs, protecting the britains.
Markus Vaston, who is the Brother of Antonia's 15-command of the English regbija-15, the great playing games at the end of the games protected the command to win and another diarrhoea medal.
Trener's battle with cancer involvement in Helena Gloveri and Heteri Staning winning in airlines.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these stories, and it is already a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, Helena Glores and Heters Staning’s gold mirror were a special role in Stacio da Lagoa.
Even in the ship there are only two sportists, she was supported by Robin Williams, who encouraged her to the second Olimpic golden meat for women to enter into the ships in the ship, becomeing the first women in the British sport history, which had been able to gain such abilities.
They were insufficiently dominated, because 39 times her guests were unprecedented, unprecedented.
Both big sportists with the bulb elegant to slide over the surface of the water, do not completely reflect this triumph.
Of every golden med in the airport is a healthy command that works hard to the sports increasingly improve their presentation and the greatest investment in their nine trainers, who did not know if he would live this day before 30 carriers, because he was found in cancer.
After she was told, she was deceived as much as she had shown.
I had an urinary cancer that was one of those who could operate and that also occurred.
If I don't do it, it'll be distributed through all the body.
And the installation will be uncontrolled.
It's a little changed your ownership.
The cancer of Viljamam returned in December 2013.
This three concluded that Willy could begin to return at the beginning of the 2014 intersection and the duration of the breakdown until the minimum, if it could be said.
I needed income, so I had to rejoice.
This stimulated the advantages.
I was in the church, and I got 6, 10 and even 15 feet long distances, although the doctor said that I would meet some of them.
That's all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was still greater.
The first thought was once about Williams, who was all the morning worried and spoke more than usually in the pressure.
Staningha, who served in the Royal Artillarie Unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was a emotional serious week, but that means me much."
This only confirms how much it means us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
With Helen and Robin, the three years have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have achieved anything, so great thanks to him, he's the best trainer of the world.
I can't imagine better trends or better trends.
Helena Glovere and Hetere Staning have not lost any stories for five years.
The couple has such a significant commitment that the competitor cannot be associated with.
Even the last 500 meters when the command from New Zealand and Danish began to touch, Staning and Glores were too big.
We've felt every morning.
Helen's crying, "Save the ritme, keep the rite."
It is important to avoid losing concentration.
We had a good start, but at the same time we had no high hope.
On that day, we were not intended to go to records, but simply we've been able to argue and win the stories, and we've also done it.
A few years will be repeated to decide what to do.
In the next neighborhood, Gloera and TV will be searched for St. Basel.
At the time, she simply wants to be thrown.
I didn't want to say that these were my last accusations.
It would have been too big pressure.
In London, I needed about six phones to realize that I am an empire.
It was a new shot, and I was stuck.
This time it was necessary for about four minutes.
She said, "It's fantastic."

Coleg's VID leader's office is "virsy to the last".
According to its statement, the President M'im Kučinskim (Zello and Landscape Union) and Minister Dani Reizniecei-Ozolai (Green and Landscape Union) are already "principally important" to approve the candidate of the Ministry of Financial Affairs by the VID leadership.
Rajski states that both Kučinskim and Reizniecei-Ozolai's approval of the VID leader in this government is the "primary major decision" that can affect it as a political agency.
If you now start to change the position of the VID leader in the choice of the candidate of the Officer, it will not affect their immigrant administration.
A question is included in the workshop of the Minister's Chabine of the weekly meeting on the transfer of the VVD College's leadership to the VID General Director of the Government.
The Coleg's leader of the VID was executed by Mr Reizniece-Ozola after the derogation from the service was rejected from In≤a Pétersone and when the complaint to the Director-General of VID ended without a result.
The VID leader's office at the executive of Dace Pelé in Thursday, on 11th, the Latvian Radio interview - if she had offered her to candidate to the leader's office, she could be at Christ.
Financial Ministers recognized that other candidates of the leadership of the VID were not temporarily exposed.
Raivis Dntars also admitted that NA was still supported by the Colegov VID.
The possibilities of reducing the budget deficit in Spain could not be endangered to create a government.
Before reporting, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal have not implemented sufficient comprehensive measures for the deficit level of the budget to 3% of the internal Community product required by the euro zone.
The estimates show that the deficit of Portugal's budget was 4,4% of the P, but in Spain 5.1%.
However, the European Commission decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, at the same time, to achieve fiscal objectives for the next time.
One of the reasons why, however, the EC has not introduced sanctions against both the countries referred to, has the euro skepticism in many EU countries.
The additional sanctions shall only be decreased.
Criticals also demonstrate that the EC has not been coherent in its decisions, agreed from the beginning on a single rules and then not able to apply them to the procedure.
For example, the German Bundesbank President Jens Veidmann showed that Europe is such a loss of trust by creating people's view that the rules of the European Union are recommending, not committed.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have been able to extend the deficiency of the budget until the end of this year to Portugal and to Spain until 2018.
The European Commission promises to check both of the progress achieved in the nearest phases, simultaneously showing that Spain and Portugal should be able to introduce further advancement measures if it requires conditions.
The initial prognoses show that the objectives of Portugal could be achieved at the specified time and that the budget deficit could have reached up to 2.5% of the internal product of this year.
This means that in the framework of the Stability Programme, this State government has to be implemented by a number of 0,25 per cent of the P.
These measures should be included in the budget of this year, additional attention to the control of the costs of goods and services.
In Spain, employment is much more complex.
This year the budget deficit must be reduced to 4.6%, ≥ 3.1% and 2018 – to 2.2% of the P.
Furthermore, the following two years of consolidation should be 0.5% of the P each year.
In particular, the achievement of these objectives has made the fact that eight leaders of Spain's political parties have no longer agreed on the establishment of the Government, and it is still more likely to make Spain the third time in the year to take the elections of the first time parliament.
However, the ecological opinions show that three elections will not be significantly changed in the political country.
The most popular party is the right Prime Minister of Mariano Rahoy's national party, whose desire has been recovered from 33% of the vote.
Its popularity has been a little unique socialists until the popularity of the "Podemos" party, or "We can" and "Ciudadans" or "Pilsons" has been a little reduced.
The Parties wish to enter into the Government of Socialists and Ciudadans, in contrast, not until the middle of October, to accept and submit the European Commission to the approval of the 2017 budget.
As the Representative of the Group of the Group of the People Parties of the Parliament has announced, Rafael Hernando, if the government is not to be established and the elections of the parliament will be done for the third time, Spain will become a whole European mixture.
The cleanness of poultry in the Riga Sea is critical.
In the fifth year, the publics concluded that, despite the number of wastes each year, the number of residues was found, and the majority of the payment visitors here.
The most highest places are Rīga.
The main towns say that payments are very difficult for each day to be thrown, but to fight injustice visitors are very difficult.
Furthermore, the losses left during the gases may be covered in water, thus increasingly disturbing its quality.
Except Liepha's plumbs and residues in Kurzem, the cleanness of plumbs in other places in Latvia is critical.
Such an announcement has been distributed in the "Mana Sea" campaigns this week.
In the fifth year, by measureing the road to the Riga Sea, the people have concluded that the number of residues left every hundred meters has grown up.
Unfortunately, this critical assessment has been made today.
"We're going to be the year when the number of wastes at the floor of 100 metres may even exceed 200 units," says the "Mana Sea" representative of Ulme.
Latvia's radio calling, he was located in Tuja's plumb, where the voluntary guy will continue to run along the Riga Sea.
This year, between the various disorders and the remaining picnics are going to come even to the district lights that are left in the sea swimming.
The overseer and Ulme's organizational member states that the people are guilty of the offense.
"The wallet source is a good floor visitor, since more than half of the total number of wastes is plastic, different waste, starting with mass, plastic boxes, which are already in the stage of divorce, they are not identifiable, and the exhibitors, puddles, corks," says Ulme.
There is also the Riga's house in the neighborhoods among the most unclean pools.
For example, in Daugaugr, a center of meters, averagely assembled 800 residual units, which are critically many.
The campaign organisations also claim that I should be able to be seen by the exhibitors and not by any warning or after the signs of the chair.
"The major numbers of all three Riga's payments together - Daugavgr'u, Vakarbull and Westquack - despite the great and lowerly desired, or the goal to which Latvia runs up to 2020, the number of residual units to 135 units" concludes the environmental defence.
Purification of pool places every day, in the westday even twice, the representative of Ugis Mediauskis.
However, the fight against the indigenous visitors is very difficult.
We are returning to this people's cultural issue.
"To those who use alcohol, squeeze and do all of the things that may not be done, even special characters are not active," reports the Mediterranean.
Therefore, the Mediterranean invites the employee visitors to report to the police officer also.
The police can be called, indicated on these crimes, and all of them to fight.
You can put some new warnings, but, as I said, it will be like radical changes.
"So as all of us should simply turn away and be unnecessary to such criminals," he stresses.
The water quality measurements have already been conducted for fourth time a health inspection that can be set behind official payments.
In this year, as in other years, water quality is good and satisfying.
Currently, it is that the water quality in all 56 areas is always good and there is no restriction to payment.
"The last time we'll take an analysis at the end of August," reports the inspection specialist on the environmental health issues Normund Kadicus.
The residues left on the ground may be covered in water during the steep coasts.
However, this can affect its quality, the environmental specialist.
Rotation in Russia's elite will continue - the exchange of the leader in the Putina administration.
Did you remember the time?
Vladimir Putin announced the Russian media that Sergej Ivanov would leave this subject to himself and will be the special representative of the President for natural protection, environment and transport matters.
Recognizing changes, Putin's television camera gave Ivanova thankful words: "We loved Sergej Borisovič, we work together for many years and do it successfully."
I'm satisfied with how you're doing your trust in the ability.
I will remember our agreement by not using you at the leadership of the President's administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I will understand that you want to change the field of operation.
And I hope you will also use your knowledge and appreciation in the new office.
However, it is designed that the management of the President's administration is a significant office, which has made Ivanova as one of the most affected people.
Since the elections of the State's expectable opinion in Russia were increasingly concerned that this step was combating the power of Russia's political elite.
Ivanov was also called as possible at the chairman's office of Putina, therefore the claim that he himself wanted to take the head of the President for natural protection and transport matters, providing doubts.
As shown by Lsm.lv archae, Ivanov is the general group of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov was a sense and nearby President of Russia, Vladimira Putina.
He started in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putina became the leader of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his website.
On the other hand, the first President of Russia, Boris Jelcina, in the murder of the Government, was signed as a secret of the Russian Association Council.
In 2000, after Putina has been acquired by the authority, the "Information Safety Doctrine" was approved, including national censure mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister for the Protection of Russia, but already in 2005 - the Prime Minister of Mihail Fradkov and was responsible for the development and export of the Russian protection industry.
Now, after the delay of the Office of the President's administration, Ivanov will also keep the place in the National Security Council of Russia, where the new president's administration will also work.
Vineyards from the Council party in the elite.
The leader of the President's administration has been recommended by Ivanov himself.
We and Anton Eduardovich are already known.
Again from the time we worked in your leadership in the government.
And in the last five years we met practically every day.
"I'm therefore convinced that, after all professional and personal characteristics, he's in this work," said Ivanov.
Vino ≥ of the person belonging to the elite of the Council party.
Her grandfather Karls took a high officer at the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years up to 1988, was its first secret.
The Internet issue of "Meduza" with reference to the book "Island's self-determination and independence" wrote that at the end of the 80th year, Karls Vaino was requested to give a licence to Maskva to use the participants against demonstration.
However, he received a refusal and lost a short time.
After that, Vano was moved to Maskva.
Anton Vano has resolved the Institute of the International Relationship of Maskva and has managed Japanese language.
However, he has lost the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's Protocol.
The new message is that Russia has disturbed several high-range officers in recent weeks and even arrests, including a number of governments and federal representatives, has been replaced.
As a political indication, President Vladimir Putin renewed the elite before the expected elections in 2018.
One of the main characteristics - more frequently at the leading staff are representatives of the structures.
Moreover, Nikiforenko is lost of olympical games in the first battle.
This was the first fight, and the Latvia's killing sticking to its share in the empotic games is part of the end of the 17th place.
Trener Oļeg Baskins Latvia's TV admitted that Nikiforenko's hope was low, and that was already before the accusations.
He also repeated that the murderer was killed in the battle.
It is fair that Nikiforenko came to start in a different weight category other than usually - in a category of weight up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaidjan was more than 25 kilograms.
The new message is that Jevgeniy weighs up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki in the fighting category until the opposite was exposed to the year.
As a result, the Latvian murder accusation of Rio has been closed.
You don't want Rio to smile.
On Thursday, Jewgeni, the murderer, Borodavko.
In contrast, he had an opposite, but the ambition of sometimes produced a surprise.
He's got it.
Artura Nikiforenko's updev was still more difficult, since the move is less and the opposite also respectable.
It is similar, even though he holded the tea for half a minute longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, Latvia's murderers lack the most ambition.
Since the Federation Gun ́s Kürn and his financial station Vladimir Šestakovs, Alexander Jackevićs from Latvia was removed from "Golden Score" - the murderer's development on a deteriorated line.
Jackević, who is here consulting Kazakhstan's murderers, and Vsevoldam's Greenhoods are not worth it.
But if he doesn't worry, he will not be.
And it's the federality prerogat.
Therefore, as from other galaxies in the Latvian Federation of Judea, the Promising of the Presidency of the Latvian Federation of Rio to excite med.
Flight away from reality.
Last night, we were waiting for volejbol mačk Samoilovs/SHDDINS - Evandr/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga as already in the "nave" group - losers finish games.
Latvia's duty had a little derogation - was also able to lose, but not more than four points in two seats.
The summary was still grown in the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the wind card virtual in the whole width of the wind.
The brassman cancer made additional difficulties.
At the beginning, it seemed that it could be our -- which is the most - all-compatible.
But it wasn't.
It was very simple to play with Latvia's duty here.
He's serving at Samoil and waiting for him to go.
At the end of the first seat and at the beginning of the three, the layer was no longer.
In that time, the work was small, but when it was, it was the honor.
Brazilian Samoilov and Shoedyn were able to win two seats, since the first took the lead at 16:15, but to 16 he also left, as a result of the loss of the depth.
But they could also lose with 0:2, because the second seat deficit was -4, however, even thanks to the wind, it went out to win.
The third had already been reading in the sign of the Evandr service.
In the chair - uncertainly accepted service, the second play is often flying too close to the network and Samoilov remained a little variety of the results of attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilov in the field, he worked more effectively, and only for Sasha's loss would be unprofessional.
Cross also wronged, and it is symbolically that the last bomb block tried to him.
He's lost the command.
This time, there was also a mistake - at the third seat only two evandrian attacks were awaited from the map, but the bubble was a line.
Two walks were near the line.
It also decided to be a good opposite.
If the first two games of Evand had been moved with the servers, they had a product.
The total total loss of table together.
Now we need to examine the causes of uneffectiveness.
It could have been necessary for many to be near the stadium, not together with the delegation in the empire.
The road passed for two hours.
You can have a little self-depreciation in the seven halffinal series.
You couldn't have to play in Klagenfurt, but you'd better come here and be more accommodated.
Perhaps there was a mistake with the finding of the sports form.
We expect a question more than an answer.
Our big games ended.
It's aware of both of us.
What else?
Some world coast tourners have been left and also the Master's Master.
It's not a friend who has never been friends in Samoila, and it's not too famous, because there are too much personalities.
But that doesn't also need it.
When a dream of the ́impicant meat is found, it can also happen to think of the deception, because the fault is not only searched for himself but also in the partner.
It is not difficult, but much more difficult in Latvia will find an honest partner.
Both brothers are playing big, but the one with Tom has already been deceived and has also been deceived, but Mihail Samoilov is still too green to begin to get the world headquarters.
It can be generated by Harald Regg, Alexandra Solovey, Edgar Toch, to return to the Mount of Mâtini, but it will not be better than this variant, which not only proved himself in the world's pass.
The Copcabean laughed to them this time.
A certain.
Of course, it is also necessary to take into account that the plumb wheel becomes greater than two meters, covering income new pass, and only rare floor is less than two meters.
This still does not consider the ability, but it is a significant argument in the fight against winning.
We don't stay longer.
both sports and journalists have the possibility of mixing game drivers in places offered, and to choose their own.
The US basketball class lives on the cross-border ship, a part of the tenist is not in the empire.
A number of pludmales volibolists have also visited a hotel in Kopakaban.
On this occasion, the journalists offered to all the famous nightmare prices were highly overcome.
Therefore, the choice also fell on apartment iron.
The risk is because they may sometimes be unusual from a logistic view.
This time the risk is justified.
Along with Vladimir Vladimirovich apartments at Kopakabana and Ipanema borders.
Pludmale 200 metres remote, a half-hour white aren in the gateway.
Rayon's shepherds, because favelous patterns, however, wiseness cannot also lose it.
Vladimir Vladimirovith is not the one of which some of the most profissional sport journalists of the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. Seems that on Thursday morning there was another medal dream.
Laura Ekauniece-Admidina was replaced by his personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of interruption, "Porgee and A" shane in Lipay.
In Latvia, the "Porgeus and A" priority was held in 1973 in Latvia's National Opera.
Since that time, the internationally recognised severe has not been re-instructed.
That is why Césus Arts Festival and Lipse Art Forum Organizators have decided to give the auditors the opportunity to join George Gershwin's sheder.
"M ́s great joy that after ten years of interruption, when Liepja was last able to buy operations, this big George Gershwin's "Porgey and ́a" concertisation version of the operary concertity has been invited to us in the new, newly new concert "Small Gitarr", says the Concertcal of the "Small Gitarr" leader Baiba God.
Opera "Porgeus and Property" is a story of love, instability, impatience, and tragic tragedies and simplicity of daily joy.
This reflected African vitality, music and ritm.
Just this political correction is missing in this operation, this tolerance exhibition makes it so.
"And, this love story is strictly powerful, rationally beautiful and somehow deeper," says the Revisor Vesteurs Kairiš.
What I am most pleased - by listening or refreshing this operation, is always such a spectacular point - glorious melodies, praising against, but these pass from one character to another, lighting one person or another person, or core, or or orchestra.
"This is the same injury, this building," the opera opera "Porgius and a" musical leader and manager Andris Poga.
Opera visitors are the only idea that this is a gross occurrence.
They have great joy to hear the Gershwin's glorious work in this world.
Congratulations that in Lipay can only be the world’s floor.
"I exercise professional," the operation visits Edgar Lams.
The concernity was particularly the fact that in the newsground Concertation "Small Gint" first in the orchestra wood played an orchestra and the first time the oper concertveve.
The extent to the Museum of Arts could be called John Rosental.
The Riga Size of Andris America Rosental showed that the address of the Museum could also be not the part 10a of the Russian Government, but the New Rosental field.
The Guideline of the Museum Mâa Lace admitted that the reregistering of the address would create a crucial bureaucratic burden, however, these ideas are appreciated and therefore agreed with the proposals of government.
The city of Riga has started this idea in 1936, creating Burkard Djan's reminder to Janim Rosental, who stands at the museum.
The right director of the Museum Wilhelm Purvitis was one of the initiators for the design of this reminder.
In this way, this next action could be purely logical.
I have a little fun of my heart conscience all the time, but Wilhelm Purvite, where will we stand his name?
"But if you, Mr. America, promise advice," Lace said.
It is noted that the National Art Museum has built its doors officially in May.
Finally, the VEF Culture City will begin reconstruction.
Calls for about 11 million euros will renew SIA "Velve".
Planned to renew several cities, including two looking medicines, and to adjust the building of people with movement in traë.
The Court's opinion has been designed to make a project for six million euro money for the European Union Funds, but the Director of the Special Department of Rīga's opinion recognises that there is no complete satisfaction for the European Medicines project for the time.
"Despite the political willingness of the VEF Cultural Cultural Remote Works, by participating in the European Structural Funds, we expect a decision, a real action from the Financial Ministry officers, it will be granted or not," Burovs said.
In December 21, we were told that everything was dependent on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance adopted a letter from the European Commission to make the same decision that Brussels does not make a decision here.
Currently, we believe that there is another debate once again, then, we will do what we can expect in the next days.
"I can say that the Riga's opinion without doubt guarantees that this process will be started and completed in terms," urged Burov.
It was reported that more than before the year, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural town collected a concert before immediate renovation of the building.
Even the past year, the renovation of the building was not started and the collection continued to work in unusual circumstances.
The renovation of the VEF Cultural City in the Strategy of the Special Department is divided into the commons of independent overburst works, where each will ensure the implementation of appropriate cities.
First - Increasing the accessibility of the VEF Cultural town and improvement of the surrounding territory.
It is intended to arrange surroundings and engineer communications and to renew the building phases.
Second - VEF Culture City improvement of service offers.
It plans to improve the building internal, wall and grid restaurants, shadows and sound entries, and to arrange building engineer communications.
Third - Enhancement of the work conditions of the Radocha Amateur Collection, which includes plans for the improvement of the equipment, space equipment and ventilation systems.
Before "L" the 40th Jubilee legend can be recognised in Lithuania.
The exposure will be considered by various characteristics of the "L" objects - photographs designed on the timeline to reflect the functions of the group from the beginning to 2010 when the ends of the group are notified.
It will also be shown by participants' views, music instruments, appreciations and concerts, as well as other non-visible things for the public that reflected the work of the "L" group.
It shall be added to the objects of the Little Museum.
Exhibition of visual designs but is in collaboration with the mode artist and Elitu Patmalnici.
The musicians who were also with the "L" group and their neighbors were referring to the call and shared with objects and memories.
In 1972, the "L" priorities were searched when a Vocational Instrumental Assembly was established in the House of Liepa's Culture, held by Juris Pavitol.
The assembly participated in its initial station at the festival "Genial Dinner" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the views of the city and of the Republic.

Recalling its candidature to the Government of the Government of the Government of the Environmental Service (VID) of the Government of the Government of the Government of the Government of the Government of the Environmental Ministry (Inga Coļegova), the Professor of Latvian University of Social Scientific Faculty, Oyirs Skudra.
The Colegiary Chapter on the revocation of the candidature in relation to the coalition of the government is committed to the disruption of the government.
The close conversation with the Agency LETA stated that he was difficult to imagine that "Unitity" would support the Colegian candidature at the weekend of the Government meeting.
This is the case if the "Unity" ministers vote against, but the Colegovus will be approved at the same time, it will lead to the government's delegation.
The expert also believes that prior to the revocation of the candidature, Kolegova has consulted the Ministry of Finance Danu Reiznieci-Ozolu and the Minister of Minister Mâi Kučinski.
At the same time, it was also the "Unity" approach which was strongly opposed to its candidature.
By predicting whether the complaint will help to find a suitable candidate, Skudra recognises that there are two variants - or a compromise is now selected, or that the authority as the Director-General will continue to carry out the executive of Dace Peléc.
At the same time, he shows that if the Financial Ministry said that there was no other candidate, it was a household in Peleka that it could not be involved in the concurrence.
LETA has already reported that the Government of the State Environmental Service has decided to revoke its candidate to the Director-General of the VID.
Because of the "Unity" complaints, the Government abandoned Colegova's approval on Monday on the headquarters of the General Director-General.
Following the decision of the Government to take decision, Colegova demonstrated that it was the leader of the VID.
However, the opinions later changed - on the Friday presentation to the Minister for Finance to Dan Reizniece-Ozolai she showed that she was referring to its approval to transfer to the leadership of the VID and that would not be a simple choice for her.
The Secretary of Press of Minister M'a Kučinska for the Agency Andrejs Vaivar LETA said that a new concurrence has been made at the Vice-President of the VID Director-General.

Snapchat 'Anime' effect criticizes asylum carication
Snapchat's representatives say that this filter is an animation to be incorporated, but some commenters say that it is racially unsensitive.
With this crash effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality every day in absolute way and play with your identity.
You can convert yourself to ananas, dogs, or sisters that are in Roya Lihstenstein's head.
Lights are migratory, screening instruments that generate more than 30 miles [30 miles] per day.
Any error has become considerable.
Snapchat Leather Effects have already been criticized by receiving the exceptions that the application popularizes too black or light face tons of skin tons as a ideal beauty.
Soonedel has been published the effects of the milk of the leaf that allow users to create the eye, the teeth of the teeth and the rubber of the hair, and some critics have caused it to be a racist Asian carrier — “gelt geys”.
The question was also questioned whether such anticipations did not prove that the company had greater problems with diversity.
The reports and negations were dismissed on Thursday when the issues of The Verge and Motherboard indicated that the effects of the lake have been removed from the application.
The company claimed that the target was to imagine animals, not to carry the Asian origins.
However, those who have threatened racism reacted to the painful stereotypes.
Other categorieally lost the comparison with Anime.
The Corean Art student Greis Sparapani Twitter recorded a wide range of images. In the letter of the e-mail she shows that the effects are "evitative and unworthy to say no more".
She added that it is difficult to notice the acim comparison between asylum carictures and the effects of lactic effects.
This shows that the light effect is not just the yellow face but the yellow face in understanding the racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has entered into this culture.
In addition, the culture of the population is in the recent fight for diversity and integration, starting from the company's halls to Hollywood and the events that we use daily.
And Snapchat is more sensitive to these things by the major youth auditorium, representing different races, in particular of the citizens.
If Snapchat is locked to create an image that excuses the users, then "this things are not considered today," the twenty-twenty-year interview of Keitia Jou.
Thursday, the manager of the "Medium" product, Joe, removed its Snapchat application and recommended others to do the same.
In its article "Medium" and the phone interview, it claimed that its views of race problems are caused by Snapchat because of the employment policy, which is not sufficiently supported by the diversity of racials.
Joe criticized the management of the company, which is mainly white men and then from their article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"It means that there is no racial difference in the company, therefore these decisions are allowed. Do some other race representatives work in the company, but they do not take the right to express their views in order to express their own opinions," the Chinese originate Jue believes.
Their view also agrees with others, but Snapchat has not responded to her integrity.
Take not how many different races represent, showing that it is a private enterprise.

The Court of Congress notes that military officers have made reports on the State of Islam.
The Court of Assembly, issued on the fourth day, shows that the representatives of the United States Central Command have made reports by representing the war against Iraq and Syria in Iraq more optimist than in fact.
The central committee shall provide a general disapproval of the provisional report of the holding unit established by the representatives of the Sub-Committee of Brunoto, the Executive Committee and the financing of the Republic of Defence, demonstrating that their management has controlled the reports on the effects of the consequences in the fight against the State of Iceland.
The central command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which monitors the United States military operations in the Near East and Central Asia.
The new reports about this report are reported that the reports of the Centcom high-range reports reflected the fight against terrorism more positive than the truth. It was regulated by the image of the best achievements than the other analysis of the survey.
The representative of the Californian Republic of Kens Kalverts says, "Centcom action is unacceptable - our warriors are those who are sick if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management error in the highest direction of the search organization.
This 10-page long report is detailed to stand on the issues of the Central Committee in the resolution and analysis of the preparation of Iraq in 2014 and 2015.
In addition, it does not give evidence that the officers of the Obama Administration would have left the reports, but it shows that the Centcom management has made a known pressure on analysers to picture more optimistic views on the Islamic State (a.k.a. ISIS or ISIL) to threaten.
The Conference states that in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration of Press Relies, Notifications and Reports of Congress imaged the performance in the most positive light than it was actually.
For example, the representatives of Centcom announced that Mosul’s repair operation could be started in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city of Iraq, which still seems to be controlled by the State of Islam.
The representative of the Canadian Republic Party Michael Pompeo wrote in his report: "The longer investigation of the older staff is confirmed."
From the middle of 2014 to the middle 2015, the United States Central Administration reported by the ISIS threats in Iraq as they were true.
The Republic Party has established a working group, knowing that the analytics are in fear of the information about the Islamic State.
For further investigation, the report published on Thursday will result in new reactions in this matter.
The General Inspection of the Ministry of Defence shall carry out the investigation of the Centcom Exploration Service.
The Executive Committee of Democracy Parties for the Quartoday has made its report, which agrees to some of the working groups of the Republican Parties in the conclusions.
The Democracy Representative Adams B. Shifs wrote in his report that Centcom had too limited the preparation of the reports on the ISIS and Iraq's Firmation Force.
Mr Chifa believes that this process "hards the distribution of information", has enhanced the analytical work ethics and has "expanded unconformities to the truth".
But Shif and the Democracy Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has pressed the Centcom analysers to make reports, according to the "previous or political position".
The Daily Beast published the fourth day in the provisional Results of the assembly.
The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspection started an investigation after Centcom analysis.
The representative of Pentagone, Commander Patrick Evans, announced that Pentagons would not give comments on the conference report until the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data, and the Ministry of Defence and Management call for a dialogue on vital important national security issues.
The investigation does not only apply to the issue of whether the bombarding campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (declaration expressed by any more representative of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the last year's complaint is to be surprised that President Obama can completely trust in the reports provided by the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and in other warm points.
The criticism of the Islamic State's exhibition is to repeat more than ten years when the Centcom Exploration Analytic Gregory Hukers' County, claiming that the administration of George V. Bush has started the Afghanistan War too little to think about its possible consequences.
Huxer also played a significant role in the repealing of the Islam State explanation issue.
In the past year, the Official Representatives reported that the Hūkera Committee repeated that in contrast to the reports, the air pollution to the islamic oil country has not significantly increased the financial position of the terrorist group because they have built a temporary carrier to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this decline did not come through the Central Administration walls.
Soon the Centcom commander General Loids Ostins III adopted asses criticism, since many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation too positive.
In April, General Ostins returned and became General Joseph L. Votel.
In the United States, with the British Women's Hockey, the United States wins the fourth victory.
On the day after the winning over Japan with resolution 6:1, Thursday Keitia Bama got the first two gates of the US women's field hokey command, when the Indian command was established with the result 3:0.
Five gates in two games are unexpectedly achieved, but at 27 years old Bama said that they could not remember or who would ever have done it.
She said, "I don't feel."
I'm not one of those who count their gates.
But she knows that the result of the Olympics games is 4:0, which gives her in her group no exhibition with the Great Britain, which fourth day after the winning over Japan with result 2:0 remained unemployed.
Great Britain and the United States will be on Sunday to play the first round games.
Both commands have already qualified for the quarter final and the game will only be set to which the command will take the first place in the six command group and the other.
The first places have been profited a little longer from the meeting with the strong Netherlands reading, which is the leader of the second group.
And the unexpected Sunday game, the people have already called a surprise wind ago four years ago, taking the last place between 12 commands in London.
That command also had Bama
She was at Blubel, the field hokey node first took her hands at the age of 3 (their two sisters already worked with this sports type in Dreksel) and the national reading, when she was 16 years old, became a reading in the last player story.
She was not at Olympicals games in 2008, because she didn't come to the final.
However, 2012 was ineffective for her and her command.
In the next year, for the reading trainer, English Kregs Parham was appointed and all changed to the right side.
Bama called it "culture, mentality and physical changes".
We haven't invested so many jobs in London as now.
We have completely changed everything.
Thursday Game Bama repeated the result, at the first half of the gates with a bathroom year from nearby distance.
India's games started without a conviction in their account, but their reading was ≥ s≤ and maintained a minimum result 0:1 to the end of the threeth period, when Bama was rebounded the gates.
She introduced bowls in the area of anti-bombs on the left side of the field, then looked at going to the middle of the field and rai's gates of the anti-bombs, in line with the leadership 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period Melisa Gonzalesa guided another gate.
This was the first US portsard of Jackie Brig's sauce game, each of the first three games on one door.
She's cut off.
And Bama, too.
"I'm going now," said Pahams, but how much alike, showing the game on Sunday.
The depression period is "Satured malt"
In March 1933, after the election of the President, Franklins Delano Rūzvelt, sitting in the wool room for a malt.
The President Ruzvelt has increased the delictes of the small bullshit like the coss liver boxed in the furnace and Merilenda's brush.
But at that time, his malt was a little more famous: a pile of eggs at the top of the tops, a cartridge and a wilderness - a pudding of the pulmonary.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "This is a way to solidarize food with people who were serious."
Her husband Andrew Kou adds, "This is also a message to the people how to eat."
Some from the Brooklyn Heights region are food stories.
The last book of Kou describes the Chinese in America, but Zegelmane described its book "97 Abels" through the eating of the east house of Manhetas' east.
Their new work "Satana Maltita", which will be published on Thursday by Harper, is a story of foods during the great depression.
In showing a known solidarity in the culin, they held the reporters "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop" together in a simple midday meal that seems to be in Flatiron's region and works since 1929 when great depression started.
For 54 years, Mrs. Zegelmanes sent a mushroom with coasts and rubbers, and the 57-year Cou sent the salts of tithes, cartridges and gardens.
When the reporter sent the fake , some admitted that his choice was appropriate to the negotiation of the great depression's time food .
Mrs. Zegelmane said that the fake sack was 日.
Staying in the ground, healing, and powder.
They were found on the basis of the constance and other constances that were rich in malt.
You have imagined how it is - to take so many grounds to be a middle-day place.
Mr. Cou has been renewed.
"Freely it seemed that the wind is filled with the wheat," he added.
The mid-day board of pre-depressions was similar to the switzerland board, particularly in the field areas.
Women have eating their husbands-students and brocastis, midnight and evening have been offered freshly paid sacks.
During the First World War, the Europeans had a food. The "Satured malt" described how the people adapted the circumstances when the America had not been the land of overflow.
"Therefore the eating became the main object of the American people's attention every day," Mr. Kou said, deceiving why he and his wife wanted to write about this team.
The new budget diets also became significant: so unknown food as a fake sack and soil became every day, the swimming was "a great way of use of overcasts", noted Mrs Zegelman's, because the poor could hide the unfortunate composition under the cross-border targets.
Sweet fruits were replaced by frozen fruits.
The meat, which for years had been the main component of the maltician, has now become a roughly rare luxus goods.
When the number of calories and food maintenance was greater than longer, young, unused forms were born.
In an ancient brochure, Mrs. Zegelmanes found receptions as by paying with the ground-friendly muscles.
Mr Kou adds: "This was not a middle board extension."
Mrs. Zegelman says, "It was surreal."
The mixture of the earth and the cept sypool is not compatible.
Many home food receptions were applied in difficult times.
As the economics of households such as Luise Stanlia, the Federal Economic Affairs Office of 1923 to 1943, determined national foods that were not modified before the Great Depression, not after them.
By publishing articles and receptions in magazines and magazines, they recommended the householders to become "economics" and to accept claims such as converting the mixture of ́s and burkans in a spiritual malt.
"Satana Maltita" is a historical garden's village.
It is particularly interesting that the government's attention to its exalted citizens, such as President Herbert Höver, "Let me eat kitchen".
Even though he had spoken of his simple childhood and eating in Aiova, he was actually eating as a small million of people who had become.
Mr. Kou says, "He liked Europe, for example, a fish with a powder.
He eated a cockpit in the yellow hostel, whispering a middle-day jacket.
He was completely found from reality.
President Ruzvelt would have accessed his own mistake, unless his wife Eleonora would not have recommended him to show an example of his food habits.
The Greater story is that Ruzvelt paid a householder who was not trained to eat until the White Nam became a place where not only one of the lesser foods in Washington, but also the most pregnant foods.
As long as the national economy returns, the majority of the depression earlier are lost.
But we continue to focus on the calories and sustainability, as well as the use of scientists in the cow, added Mrs Zegelman.
Some report that in writing the book, they received greater understanding of the food habits of Mrs. Zegelman's mother, for example, why she couldn't eat.
"He really feared to throw off the eating," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs Zegelman said, "He actually lost people."
There was a incident with wind kids.
When we were eating in Eisenberg’s eating, some of the writers went out of the desert of the towns in Soma: the floods that the president Ruzvelt had eating on midnight.
"This is a plumb-up," Mrs. Zegelmanes said, adding that it was then spread to the famous food to give a little name.
It doesn't have powder, but only busted flows, little milk, sugar, water and canel.
All of them were insultly placed in the brilliant mass of the bathroom.
I'm surprised that it wasn't so bad.
Mr. Cou's getting a few more shops.
When he listened to the "economy", he said to the wife, "It would be a throat of the rubber.
Gilead will receive recovery for legal expenditure in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The Court of Area has decided that “Gilead Sciences Inc” is the right to recover the expenditure of the legal service which he pays for the hepatitis C patents against the farming company“Marck & Co Inc”.
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of the $200 million penalty for the charge of two Merck patents that threatened it in relation to successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when the United States Federal Court determined the crime in the field of Merk, such as the misleading after the transfer of animals and other non-ethical activities.
Thursday, the U.S. Court of Justice of the Region showed that Gilead has the right to submit the legal expenditure that caused it to stop this matter.
Merck wants to get a market against Gilead dominating the market with the new generation Hepatitis C, which has 90% of hepatitis in cases of hepatitis.
It was started in 2013, when Gilead and Merck claimed one another, to gain property to the newly developed components of sofosbuvir, which is the main part of Gilead medicines.
The United States supported claim that they have completely overcome the control of Manbid's city from the Islamic State.
The United States supported in their controls have completely transferred Manbid’s north country d' cities to the border of Turkey and the last island warriors have abandoned the city on the fifth day the representative of the group.
Syria's Democratic forces (SDS) are now cleaning the cities from the last hosts who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2000 kinesian civilians, who have joined the kitchens, to the news agency Re·s told Sherfan Darviss from the SDS of the Military Council of Manbid.
"The city now seems to be completely controlled and we are looking for kitchens," he informed the agency Reʹs.
Income of Klinton in 2015 reached $10.75 million and paid a number of 34.2 per cent of the federal tax.
Hillaria Klintone's fifth day's employment in 2015, where the President of the Democratic Party's candidate and her husband in this year have paid $10.75 million and have paid the federal tax in respect of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Klinton has dedicated 1 million US dollars, mainly to his Klinton's benefit organization. The former President Bill Klinton has paid about 5,3 million dollars, establishing as a spectacular and former national secretary has received 3 million dollars from his book on work in the Department of the State, published in collaboration with the "Simon & Schuster".
Clinton's choice with the United States of Virginia, Senator Tims Keins and his wife Holton's employment for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid the federal tax rates for 20,3 per cent.
"Hilaria Klintone and Tim Keins continue to set new financial transparency standards," reported Klinton's campaign partner Jenifer Palmieri in their communication.
However, Donalds Tramps is hidden behind various institutions and responses so that the promises should not be fulfilled to repeat their information.
The payment of information is the practice of the U.S. President's candidates, but it is not worth it.
The New York Businessman Tramps and his lawyers are a reason for the audit of the State Assembly Service for no information.
"Your guyen", in his Twitter entry, reported information about the Democratic Party's candidate information, and the Ians Sams campaign partner of Klinton.
Thursday, the special adviser Michael Kohen highlighted the CNN that he would not allow Trampam's information before the audits were completed.
Trappa critics, including the candidate of the chairman of the Republican Party of 2012, Mits Romney and other Republicans, claim that his refusal causes issues about its real property amounts, debt amounts and other business commitments, including commitments with Russia.
Clintone had the oil fire on the fifteen-day video, where several of the Republics affected the Trampu’s information.
She again returned to this issue during the economic talk in Michigan on Thursday.
She told the effort: "They are refusing to do what the other President's candidates have done for decades."
"Politico" reports that in 1990, Tramps has paid a little or totally no payment, and on Friday, the New York Times business layer author reported that many books and jurists believe that nothing has been changed today.
Federal rates are a key question of this president's wish.
Klinton, supporting the proposal of the billion of Varena Bafet, popularizes the idea that every one who wins more than 1 million dollars per year should pay a tax at least 30 %.
This proposal also supports President Barak Obama.
In the last week, during the Klinton's arrival in Omah, Nebrasca, where its "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate, Bafets invited Trampe to exchange the situations.
Bafets said that he had also been conducted a audit of the Agency Service and Tramps feared the electoral, not the authorities.
Clinton's campaign is aware of information until 2007.
Now Klintoni lives in Chapakva, New York, and the period between 2007 and 2014 has paid the average federal tax paid by approximately 32 per cent and the total amount of 40.5 per cent.
Clinton 2015's report shows that only 100 dollars from their income are worth.
Their main investment was a lower cost index fund from which the Klinton dividends received $109,000.

The Jewish movies director criticizes the hotels in Berlin on the discovery of the Israelian Telesarun code after an arabic request - RT News
The Jewish French film register said to the winds of the social media when he replied that "Kempinski Bristol" hotel in Berlin is not available for Israel’s telesarun code. The municipalities are based on the requirement of Arab clients.
Klods La Holdman, documental films on the Holocaust "Shoah" register, does not hide his disapproval with the Berlin's hotel "Kempinski Bristol" and addressed a letter to the German magazine FAZ.
During recent visits, La'man was able to find the list of the telescodes of Israel’s telescodes.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which the hotel number could be approved.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been defended and destroyed?
Raksta La Holdmans.
Instead, the Champinski Bristol hotel offers a call to this country through its call center.
The register requested an accommodation from the hotel staff.
La'Man says that the answer received "he shocked".
The municipal administrator claimed that "is a recognised decision on the management of the hotel."
The reason for the code's extraction was more than a movie recorder.
"The majority of the hotels are Arabs and they request the release of Israel's code," La'Man's site of the hotel.
Suddeutsche Zeitung wrote that Israel’s messenger in Germany Jacob Hadas-Handelsman was called this case as a "small cow".
We're surprised and shocked about this incident.
That's the same thing about yourself.
And the fact that it has happened to Germany, in this hotel network there is still a greater decline.
There are no effects.
The officer said, "We hope that the hotel will make the correct conclusions."
This occurrence also gained too large resonance on the Internet, where people deceived it as a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel was simply obtained to Arab clients.
Another inscription wrote "shoot", showing that the hotel appears to Kurfurstendam near the synagogue.
Education of Der Spiegel wrote that the same hotel just rejected all exemptions by announcing that it was all "intelligence" and forgives Laméman.
"We haven't accepted an arrangement to remove Israel from the list of numbers," the Champinski representative of Suddeutsche Zeitung cited.
And add that the code is attached again to the list.
Police uses the gas of rubber and asar against protesting Brazil students.
The statement of students and police occurred on Thursday in San Paulo City in Brazil, where students were demonstrated against government educational reforms.
Police used guys and asher gas to students.
Problems started when the right careers were able to publish students as the resulted police used the rubbers and asylum gas.
There were hundreds of students in the demonstration to demonstrate their failure to reform the education system.
The proposal of the Governor of Sanpaul Geraldo Alckmina provides 100 schools, whereas 300 000 students are overtaken to other schools in order to gain funds.
Some demonstrators marked graphics on walls with letters to the temporary president Michael Temer.
This protest occurred only a few days after the previous protest, when students were in the democracy with a view to support the President of Dilma Rousef, whose inquiry was voted by the Senate.
Scotch Kel ́ Skinner at the end first, bringing to British gold medals in the broadcast
Kel. Skinner from Scotland finished the first man's driving order in the rio-screen in the rio-droom that was sold last night. The British command protected his champion title, which he gained in London's games in 2012.
A 23-year-old sportist from Glasgova played a great role in these stories, making a fine legend of the Seru Crisu Hoju Scotch and traveling the favored winners to New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain gained a surprising overcome when Hoys cured the fifth of his own Olympical Gold Meat.
And they repeated it also in the World Championate in London, although Hoy has already finished his sportist career.
Problems were a stage between Pekin and London Olimpic games, because they came to replace the negative beginning of the specialist James Staff.
It was the last time for them.
When Hoy left, his place was trying to perform Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton.
The British trainers hoped to Skinner, looking at the potential that he later proved.
Hindes, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoju and Skinner, who set up the Olympical Record, but the best start of the talk was the New Zealand command
However, the British three profits were golden meat.
And the Hindes after his beach were tired, Kenya was in the lead, and Skinner protected this leader.
Strat’s change played a major role in winning, since Hindes went with greater transport to gain Kenya and especially Skine to go more.
Hoy was a representative of the BBC, and he took a look at Skiner, Kenya and Hindes' eye at the time they bought on a glorious penetration.
23-year-old cluster said, "It was an unexpected honor."
I'm doing everything to stop my name.
At the end, we set up the Olimpian record and built the World Champions.
It was simply unbelievable.
There's no better gain.
After the arrival with Kenia and Hoju in the Olympics games in London, Hindes admitted that there was an ineffective start.
Later, he repeated this comment, and the British competitors did not show the opposite.
This time there was no interaction.
Hindes said, "The British warriors in the tribes referred to London's memory."
During the last 3 months, we have become a soldier command.
We have lost so many world championates, so we believe Olimpic games were special.
One medal will be told to the country who gained seven of the ten golden meat in Peking and London.
If this achievement is in the progress of the command in the last five steps, the next five days will be disappointed.
Taking into account the result of Kenya, he could repeat the Hoja's resources, entering three Olympical Gold Med.
Kenya would mean six shielded gold medal and one grass medal. Also Kenya was born on 23 March (that seems that it is the British Holy Date, since this day has been born also St. Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rodger Banisters).
This date also has been born by Hoy.
Kenia's words are sprint, who starts today and continues in the next three days.
A 28-year-old sportist from Bolton said, "I'm just trying it now.
The command is always the best.
Because then you can win with the command.
If honest, then winning one is a little single."
And the Hindes said, "If he gets two other golden meat, he should be put into the order of the armies."
On that day, it was the only battle for med, but it was not the only good news to British.
Sir Bradley Vigins, Eds Clensy, St. Burks and Oveins Douls showed the most possible time for four miles in the building.
Their time was 3:51.943
The World Record, which was established in London in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first round and final will occur today on the second side of the day, where Vigin will certainly be in the centre of attention.
He had an unconformity with the Commissioner last night when the judges called him to measure his statute.
Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Sanda, Elinora Barkere and Keitia Archibald from Milgavia set a new record time 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British Breaking Command, hoped., will be aligned with med in the middle of Olimpisk games.
Remembering the exciting and unrepentant snow in Peking and London, everyone expects the same achievements to Rio.
At the same time, after accusations in sexualism and respect, the Technical Director Shane Satons, and the carrier ends also Hoy and Victoria Bendleton.
However, at the beginning of the first speech, the Great Britain has always reached the highest level at the right time.
Portland's coast's rubber becomes unfair, because a warrant contract is stopped.
Aluminium has become unfair in Victoria for centuries of its rubbers and centuries in Portland, since its main clients reported the energy company about the interruption of cooperation.
This communication is based on the plans of the Victoria Government to stop the subsidiation of the energy company, which is vitally important to continue work.
20 years of subsidies will be interrupted in November.
This is a risk of more than 2000 Alkoa Portland workshops.
It may be threatened until 2000 at workshops and non-employed.
In addition, it will also be unvisible side effects, since the coast consumes approximately 10 percent of all Victoria electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa was replaced by the "Point Henry", which leads to the interruption of the operational station.
Alcoo Portlend's coast works with loss and can be ≥a.
These events have exposed a number of years of speculations on the creation of the value of Australian Dollar and the costs of the production of the railway.
The energy of the industries at manufacture AGL, which provides energy from its Loy Yang A station in Latroube Island, says that the rest of three owners will probably stop their contracts.
The majority of the stations belongs to the Alcoa and Aluminia Community, additional parts of the company also belong to China’s CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp holding company.
"AGL" hopes for the continued operation of Portland's carrier, which would mean further energy at the coast of the coast," said its representative.
“AGL” highlighted that the contracts are the "Risk restrictive contracts" which would be intended to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts shall have the duration of 12 steps and shall therefore be in force until 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive income from these contracts also in the financial year 2017," said the representative of the company.
From the beginning of the financial year 2018, the potential effects on profits are limited to favourable market previsions in respect of the majority of the prices of electricity.
“AGL” claims that its previsions have already recorded a loss of 187 million dollars , provided that these contracts will be interrupted.
“Alcoa” reports that the decision to conclude contracts will not affect the possibility of “Alcoa” to continue coast operation or to provide the energy.
The US company reported that in 2010 he concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be interrupted.
Analytics have expressed the possibility of Portland's coast covering in Victoria as well as Tomago's covering near New York, the sector was weakened because of economic weaknesses.
In the last week, the Executive Director St. Mikelson said that 600 megavates and Tomago 900 megavates were used after an analytical approximatement during Portland year.
If both of these industries are out of the energy market, the energy need is able to be able.
And that wouldn't be.
The Community legal center is decreased by 160 000 people each year.
Each year, more than 160 000 people are expected to reduce the budget, the employment could be reduced.
Three of the five people in Kwinsland - overwhelming pensions, immigrants, unprotected drivers, violence victims, and who do not have the means to fight illegal exhibition, are rejected free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been translated, warns that by reducing the financing, the financing will only become a successful.
Since June, these legal centres will receive less than 30% of funding until now.
J. Farels said that the latest report of the National Legal Centre Association of the National Legal Centers was reported that the legal assistance is now rejected to thousands of people who have no.
Mr. Farels showed that if this decision would not be rejected, it would only be possible.
He also says, "The legal center of the Queensland is always receiving inadequate funding, that means that the help is rejected to thousands of people who have it."
For people who are trying to end violent relations, people with deep advice, families who live in adultery, students who are irrelevantly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive n-aid.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government reduces the financing to 30 per cent, it means that more thousands of people in Queensland will need to solve their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the general prosecutor and Senator George Brandis of Kwinsland to stop the reduction of the financing so that people who have no legal assistance can gain it.
In the past year, the Government repeated its plans to establish legal aid level to the average national level.
The time is now to take attention to the community and their customers' needs and to invest in this important area for the Government of Palestine.
Donalda Trampa campaign accused of a court because one of the people was thrown out a swimming weapons
New York: Donald Trampa campaign organisations are charged in court because they have not been able to receive information that their North Caroline Operation will face an army against any of them when they have moved to one car in February.
This incident was described in the order of the court, which the Court of Charlottes submitted on Thursday to Vincents Bordini, the former campaign programme.
Bordini said he had been waiting for a long time to be started to see these things, but to understand that it would not happen.
In the lead of Earl Philip "from the gun, put his good purchases on the gate and turned the stones against Vincent's roadgale," Bordini said in his own ability.
He also stated that by submitting the rights and the management of the regional campaign, Bordini realized that at least four people have experienced the same.
"The weapons should not be scattered to cause losses," a letter of Bordini in their own ambition.
For two days before the presentation of this matter, the candidate of the Republic party at the Chairman's office expressed a scandal by announcing people that "The other people of the amendment", including the owners of the weapons and enthusiasms, could occur if the wish would be able to win his sanction of Hilaria Klinton and its electoral judges.
The representatives of the Trappa campaign announced that the mediums had exposed his words from the context, and he never hurt anyone to violence.
Bordini, with its demand, wants to provide the campaign organisations for a temporari supervision, but from Philips - the use of attacks, illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trampa Representative Houpa Hixa did not give comments immediately.
You haven't come to contact Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte News Agency wrote that Philip has recently abandoned the campaign.
It is also not possible to contact the "Innovative Consultations Services".
The candidate of the President of the Republican Parties, Donald Tramps, has implemented a military election campaign.
Both Bordini against the Campaign Committee "Donaldu Trump For President Inc." 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, the High Court of Justice of Meklenburg (Charlotes).
New tradition is the holiday and sports festivals in Ulcie.
Saturday, the first time in the Holiday, the evil was cut off to the holiday and sports festivals.
After ten years of complaint, it was determined that Ezer’s Festival would be no longer.
The new pages are overwhelmed.
The day started with sports rates.
This time the consensus was not in traditional ways and was too seriously taken, because, for example, the swimming had to go to the goal, the farm was flying, with a human left hand's station, "bububuilding" has not been in general any epic games.
However, each participant could see how strong, courageous, mild, and comfortable he was.
After sports games, all of the bullets in the freedoms show, where the holidays began.
At that time, the "boys' shoots" also worked, where a small man could go out in an effort to get a new boy in the wheel.
The news that could also be traditional was a tractor or motorcycle show.
Everyone discussed the leader of the prolonged administration of the Inga Kadique-Scadja, who wanted a good time of repair and safe time, but the matters were even deceived, but it was not able to make a lot of tragedy.
The lights continued to be welcomed by the youngest citizens of Ulciem.
Patie's that the world has been joined with five girls and one poet.
With the advice to the refugeers, the collection of amatier artists from the Engures newada - the viewers liked the "Rudens Ritme", the proposals of the "Red" and the "Green Parles".
And that's nothing to do with the hidden clothes.
Of course, for evildoers and citizens enjoyed the praised duty of Jaran and Danis Porgants, who were again Mildna Nabyna and Clarity Crown, as well as the wife of Birzzem's atracted from the "Diennes" fishing seat.
Bally played the "Brush" group.
Britain must maintain the Olimpic spirit and expand Hytrova.
Hytrova will not only contribute to goodness and exhaustion in the regions and in London but also to the whole country.
This, I think, has made Hitrovs an attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we have contributed to a great work that all the regions would benefit from Olympical Games .
Stratford and Estherda won a lot of Olimpic games.
And we will do it again by protecting people and companies with enterprises near Hitler.
To local communities, we will only create 10 000 new enterprise opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally add the point of unemployment to young people in the area of Hitler.
Like London Olympics games in 2012, people will also be today who will believe that this challenge is too large and that the extension of Hitler is too low.
At that time, people said that the Great Britain would never come to prepare during Olympics and that it would be a world-wide outcome.
The skeptics were mistakes for 2012 and they would not be right in the case of Hitler.
There are always shoes to overcome, but Hytrova has overcome everything until now.
Like Olympical Games, Hytrova is a infrastructure project from which the benefit will benefit all of it, not recall individuals.
Enlargement is the possibility of up to 180 000 new jobs, the economic extent of 211 billion, by creating plants for both employment and the prevention in this aircraft and throughout the United Kingdom.
Heather works a great command that has created 11 billion billion investment infrastructure infrastructure programme, including the time and the budget at the start of a terminal 5, which has been called as the best aircraft at the end of the world, and which has been built between the two most intense schemes of the world.
They are now going to create a third road, which will be financed with private investments in about 16 billion taxes.
London Olympics games were greater in 2012, and I am surprised that it will also be the extent of Hitler.
It is time to re-evaluate the Olimpian spirit and expand Hitler, ensuring our trade and creating a new employment environment with which the Great Britain could be deceived.
Lord Paul Dieton is a member of the Government of Hitler and the former secret of the Economic Ministry of Commerce.
In Switzerland, a woman comes back to the large road by giving self-sufficiency.
In the middle of the night, he went to the large road.
The police wanted to find witnesses' accidents when the morning tomorrow she went over several machines.
The accident occurred fourth day after midnight to the A1 road near Morges in the Vo Canton.
In the report of Voøjona, the police report states that the woman was about to go into the dark road, where she was gathering several machines.
Of course, the victims, the 49 - year - old swimming, collected several machines, including a hard machine.
She dies in the place of an event.
In many cases, the shofers already have been introduced, but others are not yet corrupted, the police calling for the rejecting of the shophers and of the injury witnesses.
In this case, a criminal investigation, which is a logical step, has also been initiated by Le Tribune de Geneve, judge Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether one of the incoming carriers will be the same.
Did it have been possible to avoid disorder?
Hofsteller adds: "It's a disastrous prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred during the last 5 years show that no of the carriers will be called responsible.
In both cases, the gay night had gone to the large road, so it was decided that the cars cannot predict that the night in the middle of the road would be a gay, a story of the news.
In the past year, a police officer was justified in disappointment when in August 2014 she took a man who was in the middle of the night to the A1 road near Paijerna.
In the court, the 22 - year - old prisoner was drunk and later observed to sleep on the road.
The Court concluded that the police officer, who was on the road to the accident, had passed the circumstances in the appropriate way and the judge admitted that the walking man on the road was "incompletely unusual and ordinary case".
Everyone who has information about the fourth day of accidents near Morges is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The signature of the new VID leader is on the Internet for the complaint of the Office of the Office.
Avaaz.org has started the signature in the Petitition port for the execution of a new State Income Service (VID) office officer.
The Petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Green Union (ZZS) shows that it wants the process of establishment of a cross-border and professional staff.
Petition was created in 10th, and now 55 people were signed.
Ingas Colegov's execution process is unprofessional and unprofessional.
This refers to the best traditions of the Council of the Union.
This discreds national administration and turns away from the government and politicians.
"The text of the petition is required with the criteria to evaluate all candidates."
Their author B. showed that there are no known criteria as Kolegova's chosen office.
Without prejudice to that of the candidate to the VID work.
The Petition states that the State Office should establish a new, separate concurrence in which professional candidates are discussed, specialists of the staff class and offered an appropriate payment.
The Minister for Finance Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially designated the officer of the Colegu VID leader in the last week, this week in the Government was intended to approve him in the new office, but all the "Unity" ministers voted against, so the question for a week was left.
Samilow: If we lost, then I'll play bad.
Pludmales voleibolists Alexander Samoilovs and ́Shiddy's hoped for the honor of Riodejaneiro's empire games, however, unless they are concerned, there is no rights where they are from the consensus, after the outcome of the tournament, the Samoilov was released.
One of the most powerful floods of the world over the fourth day of the subgroup tourner from the playing 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilians Evandr Gonsalvesh Oliveir and Pedr Solberg Salgad, from their share in the most important sport for the fourth.
In the three subgroups of Latvia's sports were won by one, but the same relationship was two other couples.
Three of the middle-small points, which, after the warmth of this, were the most electoral loss of Latvia, were numbered.
"The first seat we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we also stayed at 16 points," the game waited to remember Sh.D.D.
I don't even know how the remaining seat d' remains without points.
It should not be played.
After that, in the second seat, everything was fine and the end of the seat went out to remove the game, where it had to be a good basis for the third seat.
We started like it, but after we had reduced the sides, the result was only one command.
M. was too many errors in the attack.
All the commands were similar in the subgroup, and all the foots were three seats, so it was important for small points.
"The sportsman needed to play more like, not several times to give 3-4 points after order," said the sportsman.
We knew Evandr could be preserved.
"In the first seat we ended with it, secondly we loaded 1-2 points, but the third at +4 has already gone the game," she recalled.
We tried to do the best game.
It's soon to meet, sometimes no.
The co-valuation distribution was not seen before the dead, but it was known that there were more small points to be needed.
"If we lost, then I played bad things," said Samoilov.
From Evandra, we were waiting for good servants and with their first seats too closely, but at the third, he opened the service and was difficult to make an attack.
At the same time, I had a lot of mistake in the service of Pedr, but it had to be done.
Samoilov said that, contrary to the previous sword, sports today had no nervousness.
"We've played, we've also been protected, but we needed better service to take," said the sportsman.
"They played and finally met on the "Ourra"."
Before the tournament, we said that the exil was the most precious.
We were looking forward to fighting for the first place, but we were not even in the group.
"All of us were waiting for medal and we also, but then there is no more responsibility - 25th or fourth," said Samoilov, who predicted that the gate would continue to play together also in the north.
I don't think the question will be and we will continue playing together, because this is only one tourner.
Samoilov Riodejaneiro was already a three-emphy game carrier, since in 2008 he started with the München Plavin, but four years ago he played with Russland Sorokin.
This was the second beginning in Olimpiade.
Latvenergo also follows the gas market for the process of transmission from the potential marketing.
The National Energy Company of Latvenergo followed the gas market for the process of traveling, both from the consumer and the potential marketing holding, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidre.
"The decision on whether the gas market in Latvia will also be attached as a market, will determine the model of gas market and legal regulations."
"Therefore, by its part, the institutions shall regulate the establishment and comments of the acts, as well as our proposals," Bidere said.
The BNS has already said that the Economic Ministry (EM) has developed the project of the Latvian Gaze, in collaboration with the Commission for the Regulatory of the Services and the Energy Company, which will change the principles of the existing functioning of the natural gas market from 3 April 2017, to ensure the rights of the natural gas users to freely choose the natural gas market.
With a new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of the EM is to make the natural gas trade process as possible a simpler and user understanding.
Therefore, as the most effective and most important solution to the user's service is selected as a "certificate model", where all activities relating to customers' service provide trade, one contract, one account and one location of information and customers' services, by abandoning the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system.

Because of the neighbor’s replacement, the man is at the broken grills and is pressed to leave the house.
In the 4th study, Dmitry Saidjashev, whose neighbor put a capital replacement in his area, and since that time, Dmitrium was dismissed from the grids and there was no reason for maintaining in the area.
The problem is that my neighbors have committed self - control and have been lost in my area.
Then I informed the Rīga Construction Government, the Manager of the House and other organizations.
The Executive Government said that we are no operational service and we have no experts.
"The owner of the Oil must go to the Latvia Engineers' Union, and there will be a expert from the tent," says Dmitry.
The invited expert shall come in, fixed and recognised that the overcome was not satisfied in the stage.
However, since the first department of Dmitry has passed in the building government, and until the beginning of this week, no one could answer whether there is no danger in the area of finding.
In the former government he said - that's law, wait, if you are not satisfied, write everyone after order.
"Then I wrote to Riga's opinion, but they sent home manager, then the house manager again to building, and then it's a straightway," says Dmitry.
After all paper box review, the building work is stopped, sometimes sometimes can hear that someone works there.
During two years, expertise should be carried out, and at six feeds, for the owner of the environment that carries remont work, all of these deficiencies must be removed.
The independent expert has been developed, but the building government considers it an incomplete and overseer.
The expert has not shown whether there is a deterioration of the metabolism in this recent stage until there is no conviction that the owner of the underwater is in danger.
"This is why we have requested an additional exhibition from this expert," says the Reich's Construction Representative of Ilze Zhuka.
Despite the intention of making any replacement in the top area, the building will continue.
The penalty of self-construction without construction licence is from 70 to 700 euros, but in particular, the punishment may be significantly higher.
As long as the expert recognises, the building government has decided that both areas cannot be exploited - both where building works and the Dmitry residence.
"This is not a case in the building practice when the people in such a way of ignorance or simply disapproval may have caused a threat not only to their own owner but also to the under owner of the property as this owner cannot exploit their property," says the representative of the building.
Now Dmitry leaves to look for another place, where - by radios, friends, hotels, or to earn another residence.
But the losses created by Dmitry can be able to take a lot of time from the neighborhood civil law.
Because of the perfect building of both areas to stay is now behind until the builder gets his own, and it can be lighted for even three weeks.
The losses of the creation shall be made to the owner of the area where the remote work has been performed.
The owner of this area, therefore, has not taken into account the building authority, is also threatened by the tissue for the time to the six vehicles.
Take it!

We felt threatened at that time.
As we entered, she was sitting on the strengtheners.

I've taken it now so that I'm just listening to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venera sometimes by a resident planet
In view of the latest climate mode of NASA, Venera is sometimes inhabited in the planet.
The NASA Godarda Space Institute has developed models to investigate Vener History using tools and algorithms that also use climate scientists.
The model was created to determine whether on the Veneer, whose surface is warm, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere remains awake only from carbon, sometimes have been similar to the earth.
Scientists have already mentioned that Venice’s low greeding is increasingly disturbable with blue atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation shows that once in Venice, the same atmosphere of the earth, and it will be low.
The model also looks at Vener’s previous topography.
There were more safe areas on the planet than on the earth, but there were enough water and geographical diversity on them to create property and to not allow water to escape.
In the early Venezuela, the sun was more than 30 percent.
In the GISS model simulation, the Vener's grid model repeats that the day’s air is part of its duration of 2 carriers, the press relization of the GISS scientist Antonio Del Genio.
This process is the planned surface and the crashing thing, which at the same time forms of often layers of mockers that are working as a scarlet, protecting the planet from the sun's harvest.
In the reactivity, the climate is a measured temperature, which is actually some of the wheels lower than the temperature of the earth today.
The model pictured Vener's history, which is similar to the evolution theory that scientists produced in their hypothesis.
At the same time it would be inhabited, a few billion years ago, Venera has been subject to to too large war and ultraviolet stars.
Their oceans were burned, and the winds made ultraviolet stars.
The water was completely spending, but only the planning carbon dioxide atmosphere was left with the dead-screen gas - Vener, which we know today.
Scientists published the new Venezuela climate model results in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patriks Rojs is rejected from the "Avalanche" trainer amata
Thursday, the Colorado "Avalanche" trainer and the Hocay Operation Vice-President Patriks Rojs submitted a repeal, as the reason to mention, an inadequate impact on the decision of the command.
The Vice-President and General Menedier Jo Sakiks reported this message and informed that the club would immediately start looking for a new trainer.
"In the past three years, I am energy, increasingly and objectively fulfilled my responsibility as the main trainer and the Hockey Club, Vice-President of the Hockey Club," the 50-year Rojs reported in his report.
During this weekend, I have thought much about how to improve the order's delivery in order to give it the movement and achieve higher level results.
The vice-president vice-president's vice-president has to achieve it, the main trainer and hokey operation should be completely supported by the organization's visions.
He should also have the opportunity to influence decisions relating to the command.
These conditions are now not implemented.
The speaker who agreed with the Royal Roy on 23 May 2013 thanked Roy for his investment command.
Sakik said Patrick told him today about his decision.
We understand everything he has done for the good of the organization, and we want him all the best to be forward.
At his first season with the "Avalanche" command in 2013-20114, Roy was recognized as the best trainer and took Jack Adams.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but the Colorado command of exhaust games created Minesotes hokeyists. Since that time, the club has no longer entered the exhaustion games for two years.
"Avalanche" from the 2015-2016, with a result 39-39-4, and left five points after the "Wild" command, not by the second special invitation of the Western Conference Organizators.
Slave Medicinal portsarg Royis in his carrier highlighted four stones - two with Monreal "Canadian" and two with "Avalanche".
Northern oilplattform stamps repeat negotiations and remain strike
Workers on the payment of North Sea oil platforms have been carried out because both parties have started the negotiations on the border, the headers of the newspapers.
Periodically against the ‘Wood Group’ company is carried out on the North Sea oil platforms that operate in the company’ Royal Du日 Shell.

There are several full-day meetings in the next week, which will begin at the beginning of the week, with a view to reexamining problems.
The statement highlighted that their recent measures organized after over 25 years of interruption were contrary to the planned decrease of a 30 per cent.
The market pressure of Wood Group has decreased this year by 9 percent workers in the North Sea.
In 2014, the company decreased the debt of the landscape by 10 per cent.
The company claims that additional decreases of debt would be able to survive the market losses.
Instead, Shell has already reduced the rate of thousands of people and has announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize their work through a large combination of the transaction with the British Energy Group.
Energy companies are feeling on the basis of the pressure of oil crusting prices, where the British decision is more difficult to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Member of Scotland, David Anderson, met with the representatives of the staff, to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea stream plans.
He said that the North Sea is vitally important economics of the region.

In 2016, new projects of the North Sea are intended to be acquired of $1,4 billion, compared to $7 billion in the past five years.
Keples measures the star grid in the Plejade star.
The new Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomy to collect the fullest catalogue on the stars in the Plejade star.
The new data helps astronomy to understand why the stars in this star are in various areas of Greece, as well as the form of stars' grids to be related to the planned creation.
"We hope to compare our results with other stars, we will present a width of information on the ability between the mass of the stars, the age and even the story of its sun system," reported the newspaper of Pasadena Caltech Infrasarkano Procedure and the Analytic Centre of Louis Rebula.
The star of the floor appears in 445 light year away from the Earth.
Many stars in this star just start at the age of about 125 million.
They are thrown with the rational responsibility.
In turn, these plants produce a large quantity of stars.
For the winds in the magnetic field, they brome the stars.
In the light of the stars, their grid will be reduced.
Kepler measures the gridness of each star, with time between the recognised star area, such as the sun plank, showing.
The catalogue of the new star grid shows that greater stars are in Greece than less stars.
Rebuls compares stars with the dead, the greater deiotes are carried out in the piruetes than the small deiotes.
Rebuls tells that Played's "balet" is that the low rotating objects are greater and more larger, but the most more rotating objects are small stars.
Thanks to Played's star seems so close, it is like a great spacious area that can compare the characteristics of the stars with the grid.
