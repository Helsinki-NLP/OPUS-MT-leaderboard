To return to its pre-energy level, they have to distort out of the external energy they have taken out of the light.
This makes it emitting a small light part named "foto".
The scientists lamen this "stimated radiation emission" process because the atoms are stimulated with strong light, which causes the emission of a light foton, and the light is a type of radiation.
The next illustration shows how the atoms emit photos. From the way, the photons are actually much smaller than those in the drawing.
The photons are still smaller than the material that the atoms are closed!
