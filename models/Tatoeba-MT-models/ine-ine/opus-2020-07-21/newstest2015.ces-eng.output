Peter Czech: Go to the last minute?
All Possible
Today is the last day when you can still run through the transmission window and make a big transition.
Another chance will come to winter.
Peter Czech, currently replacement of Chelsea, but now he does not sit on a new professional with Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
It is sitting in the Michovic NH Hotel, talking to the Czech journalists and chaosing the Czech Representative on the Heritage General with America and then also on the east start of Euro 2016 against Netherlands.
In Chelsea’s chair, Premier League is given the priority of Tibaut Courtois in the new season, which was first reached in the London Club for ten years.
Earlier, it was speculated that she could have interested in the Real Madrid.
The Spanish Superpohar in the campaigns with Atletic was lost in the season, and he didn't even get into the liquor season when he spent 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It also speculated about the interest of Paris SG.
The French League's season was spent by two exhibitions and two mixtures, and on Sunday he shot St. Etienne 5:0.
The most relatively pressing AS Monaco boat club.
The one has the 1-1-2 balance in the lise, and the weekend he split with the Lille mildly:
Today, on the bulvarian epical webs, the reports that the Czech could want to Queens Park Rangers.
According to the bookmakers, but the Czech department from Chelsea at last is not too probably.
Skybet to -- he wrote currency 4:00
Peter, is it possible that you change your clothes for a few hours?
I'm not talking about that, but there's never anything worthwhile in the battle.
Maybe during the day a offer will not be rejected.
How would that offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know how the offer that can't refuse it actually looks like.
It would have to come to meet all the parties More would depend on the position of Chelsea if he would solve or not the case of a club's offer.
Is it all technically implementable to do such transition when you're in Prague now?
Wouldn't it be necessary to sign a new contract anywhere in the new operation?
So I didn't think about that.
But in such a way there are players today, they are all somewhere in representative consequences, and it will certainly be closed today.
So it would certainly be more realisable.
How many clubs on the planet they could allow you?
I don't know.
So you're not going to leave?
The situation when I didn't take a new season in the first three hooks is a new career for me after 15 years.
However, it's not worth panicing, buying up and getting out there.
I would like to continue with the court on the position of Chelsea, and it's on the trainer who chooses what decisions he will make in the next weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision?
I'm taking into account all factors.
It's important for me to understand the sports’ view, but I'm looking at it from the personal page in which the family's needs are obviously part of.
Is it possible that you'd get for another club in England?
That's the question I thought I never had to do anything about me.
But it's all possible in the battle.
I don't want to make anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Renewal of the very American idea that the work of human rights is equal to human rights
The Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis wrote the law that has to protect in the committees as a civil law.
"The work of the committees works in the middle class," Ellison, the Democratic Senator for Minnesota, co-president of the Congress Committee, says.
That is why I am so proud that I can present the law that strengthens the position of employees together with the pattern of timely rights of John Lewis.
This advanced legislation gives employers the same legal opportunity to prevent discrimination in the organization of committees as in other forms of discrimination - and stops the anti-debates forces
Adjusting the Law on Working Affairs in order to enable all employees who commit discrimination, if they want to be involved in the committees, to judge themselves in the civil court - and to judge the damage or replacement of damage - is a right and necessary initiative.
It's certainly not radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other legislators present in the law is to reconnect to the American idea.
Despite the recent years of fighting committees - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other States - the Americans sometimes supported the countries worldwide to accept, expand and respect the work of rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country was a democracy, the freedom of words, the freedom of printing and the right to pollution.
When the United States after the Second World War had condemned Japan, general Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to accept the establishment proposed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their committees played a role in the forming of a new Japanese, included their tongue and openly recognized that “the right of employees is to promote, collectively negotiate and act insurance”.
When the United States after the Second World War had condemned Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers invited Germany to create a statute that ensures that Adolfa Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Germans realized that employees in a new nation would need to organize and promote, and therefore included clauses openly saying: “The right to create a community that will safeguard and improve work and economic submissions will be guaranteed to each individual and to every appointment or profession.
The negotiations that will restrict this right or ensure its damage will be canceled. The provisions leading to fulfillment of such a shelter are illegal.
When the former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was president of the International Commission for Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide consequence, they included in it the International Commission for Human Rights that “each has the right to create and enter into them the committees in the protection of his interests.”
The United States all generations accepted the basic premises that the work of rights is human rights.
When the country was working with other countries to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create a work of the committees - and their ability to collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in the position of a partner equally equivalent - must be protected.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American idea that workers must have the right to organize and promote the free and open society.
As the reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said for fifty years ago:
History is a big factor.
Today, everyone knows that the people's force committees haven't been reduced, but they broadcast it.
Increased life standards of millions of people, created a market for industrial and production have led to an unusual level.
Those who attack the committees are expecting these simple truths, but the story remembers them.
The story doesn't matter, and we didn't even have it.
The formal recognition of work rights as humans - and the enlargement of the protection of citizens' rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organization of committees - has great delay.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewed the ideas that brought up America and effected the promise of democracy from her.
The judge locked the law that could close all the throat clinics in Louisiana
The Federal Court locked the Louisian law on Sunday which, according to a lawyers, probably would close all five clinics to lose losses in the state.
The device established by a signature of the lousian Bobby Jindal in June 1, which is in force to enter the 1st September, would require the right to take a patient in the hospital from 30 miles from the performance of their practice.
The Court's resolution means that doctors may continue temporarily in the implementation of legal injuries and have to take care of this authorisation.
"The party will be able to operate its activities legally, while it will be authorised," it states in the resolution of the Federal Court of John deG^ellese.
The hearing will be planned during one month so that the judge may issue a sustainable resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to deal with the resolution last in the series of similar measures have welcomed and said to give doctors more time to get authorisation.
“The present decision ensures women in Louisiana that they will be in safeguard against the injury law to be prepared for health and their rights”, stated Nancy Northup, the President and the Executive Director of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, which, at the name of three of the five Clinics, has made a block of the law.
There was not immediately whether the decision was related to both doctors of two clinics that were not among the claimants and also requested to grant this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven States who have approved similar laws, while the Courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared that such measures were anti-dumping.
The key parts of the Texas law that would conclude the number of remaining clinics in the state blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Worship for women's rights to fight together with the United Nations of American birthdays and genealogy and the American medical association claims that the need to have this authorisation for a doctor's request which is not necessary in the medical view.
The resistance to the injuries was reassured by the purpose of protecting women’s health and some have also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of measures.
The Reproductive Rights Centre indicated that only one doctor is authorised in Louisiana.
If all the doctors in the state would have been proposed to stop carrying out the throat, this doctor would also stop to carry out the progress, a group said.
The Louisian authorities in the reaction indicated that there would not be any doctors who lose the loss while waiting for the exhibition of rights.
As a result of late diagnosis and misunderstandings of treatment, hepatitis cancer is more frequently killed
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with the body of their deceased mother, who died for the cancer of the widows in 2007.
Women in Australia's foreign threats are more risked that they die for the cancer of the wheelers than for their residents in the town.
Scientists analysed the medical records of more than 1100 Australian persons in 2005 with carcinogenic cancer and sought that only 35 % of five years after diagnosis lived.
The Governing Board of Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute stated that women in the foreign and disfellowshipped state had approximately 20% higher probability that they would die during the study than women in the towns.
Small STUDIE: New medicines can degradate cancer carcinogenety and vacuum
Women's researchers followed during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the possibility of survival affected women during diagnosis, the type of carcinoma of woven, another existing disease and socioeconomic status.
The lowest level of survival was shown in elderly women in which cancer was advanced.
In women in the foreign and disfellowshipped state, some 20 percent were higher likely to die during the study than women in the towns.
Although the study was not proposed to determine why women living outside the city had higher probability that they would die for the cancer of the wheat cancer, the doctor Jordan states that factors may be later diagnosis and wrong treatment.
"The disease is best able to treat gynecoonchologists who are usually sitting in the towns," she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services in the remote range that have to overcome the barrier in the remote form, the doctor suggested that it would help the strengthening of transport services that specialists can treat women close to their homes, and programmes for the support of people who are treated far from their family and friends.
The doctor of Jordan stated that the studies discovered that the survival of women with cancer cancer is lower, notwithstanding the agricultural position, which highlights the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.

Foreign centres decrease the number of owners of homes
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary property of the households of 35 years could lead to the fact that, until today, a young generation of consumers will reach “the major group of winners”, the garden centre will come up to 10 million dollars per year.
According to the reports, people who find lives will lose their gardens by 55% of the amount that people will lose in their lives.
As other threatening factors of the sector, which produces 5 billion dollars per year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanized areas, where they are not gardens, the debt of debt instead of the pre-term used as a parking area and decreasing the size of the garden.
In Venezuela of the Great London, where the share of households has fallen in six years of 61 % to 43 %, the lowest expenditure for garden products in Britain appears to be one household.
HTA and the Royal Gardens Company have noticed that residence in the farm or lack of the Space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden adviser for RHS, said: "The payers have a very favorite plant planting in flowers - when they move, plants can take with themselves."
The HTA report discovered that the “good” of the foreign market sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was an outcome of the higher part of the owners of homes and economic prosperity between 80 and half of the 90s.
Moreover, for this year, he foretold to take a greater department of the better time, which came after the unprecedented submissions in March and April.
When the east dictator preachs democracy.
After Putin, on the contrary of his young organization, which most of all is at Hitlerjugend, saved by atomic weapons and mostly showed all that their views were stolen to him, he gave us today a democracy suggestion.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows a lot of fascists.
A large nation has one community, and it is that it can be controlled as well as the raped nationalism, as well as that complex minority can transform into imperialistical shouts.
The time goes on the east is apparently different than the west.
While the west world thought that the war of overseer over Europe was long away , on the east, he thought that they had already been overseen and that it had to get their international position back.
This is the case of us and frustration in Germany in 30 years, precisely before the understanding of the Nazi power, and then followed the nationalism's exposure to the unlike today in Russia.
And then the completely coherent culture of the strong leader, the laughing of journalists, the elimination of incompatible political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is, therefore, too similar.
The Vladimir of Putin, and most of the Russians, probably, may be at the time when Russia was ruled by half of the world and the second part went before them.
Western politicians may have committed it themselves, maybe a little Vladimir was paying for the ram, maybe they didn't call him there he was, and they may have started to undervalue him, and he was just being a typical Russian man.
He made a row home, looked like he didn't want anywhere, and broke the knife home.
Now he decided to get a lost position back.
He's starting quickly, he's got time.
The leader's probably on the survival, so he's quick.
The Kwakazani falls, now the Ukrainians fall, and then they're in a number of patiences from Pobalta.
The Russian medveid's already shot in the skin enough.
This is certainly the case of China, who is very exciting and is probably making a deal to the remote east.
And the Germans, the Vladimir's, are very nice, how good it is, and I gave it to them in 45, so to the back.
That's how to make a new News in Karl's Varech.
It would be a basic, and ours were there, and how they printed them there, and they wanted to make a lecter of them.
Because our veterinarians now remember how they were in this Czech Slovenia.
Now vote to their Prime Minister of the Sabbath, he is so weak, will be thrown as the cibules and burn the whole EU.
It would be so playing to get up to the big Russian.
They need to remember where their place is.
And as an explosion, we use our companions who live in their territory.
The Russians are all over there, and when they say they're printing them there, they're just pressing them there, and we don't leave it, we'll protect them.
And the Russia will rule again, to what else he's born.
Europe is just good as a suggestion on which Ivan’s fierce can dance a boss.

Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israel’s children in the nearest of Gaza’s pasture returned to the school on Monday after they had spent a year in the antibombs, while during the fifty-year war between Israel and Hamas were attacked on their homes with rackets and minometes. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory is remembered from wars.
The beginning of the school was brought to the community on the south of Israel known attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of war are still clear.
In Asdod, the city in the southern country, school employees, who were thrown up the cancer, removed the rests from the wall and expected to return to children.
"We have a little fear, but otherwise we rejoice," said Ronit Bart, Saad kibuc in the local school.
A lot of children from this area are going to come back to the daily road.
Her 11 - year - old daughter Shani Bart said "is a little special" to go back to school.
"We lived a few hard moments, and we didn't leave the house," she said.
Kibuc, near the border with Gazo, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
As long as the war was stopped last week, thousands of residents like Saad stayed inside their homes or homes, and were released to the safe distances from Gaza to avoid rackets and minometes.
Many inhabitants of Naal Oz, the village near the border with Gazo, in which she shot from the Palestinian minometh killed a four-year boy with a weight.
The Minister of School stated that about twelve families haven't yet come back.
Their children were temporarily located in replacement schools.
The president of the government of Benjamin Netanjah visited a school in Sderoth, the city of the border with Gaza, which was strongly assembled by the Palestinian fire.
He invited the children to study and added: "We will seek you education and security."
Israel and Hamas, the past attack, agreed on a timely unlimited peace.
The stop of the fire led to the immediate end of wars, however, the key challenges such as Hamasa's request for the end of the Israeli-Egypt block of Gaza and the recycling of aircraft and accessories in Gaza have not been resolved.
Israel requires Hamas armies and returns the body of two soldiers falling in the war.

Hamas and other radicals from Gaza shot during the battles in Israel’s cities, especially on the south country, 4 591 cancers and shoot from minomets.

Israel’s attacks have hurt or destroyed thousands of houses in Gaza and have been hidden in hundreds of United Nations schools, which were transformed into the provisional area.
For tens of thousands of people who remain in secrets, and for continuing wars, school officers have left the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that school will be opened quickly, and they could finish education as the Jewish children and the rest of children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in the largest city of Gaza.
I'm standing behind you.
The Laphat Treated the temperature
The Czech Balance Representative today before south in Prague has met before the Central Preparation with the United States and the next introductional strengthening of Europe's Mistership against Netherlands.
From a thirty-five-fire, the Spanish attacker David Lafat, who suffers the temperature.
David's not yet here, but Sparta had problems last week, it was more players, and David still has some of these problems.
But we want him to be here and he's all right before," the coach Paul Vrba said to the journalists.
"If it's two or three days, or it'll be fit tomorrow, it'll be seen according to his health status that our doctor will decide," added.
Other players are okay.
"Ok, of course, someone has a painful pain, but it is not that they cannot train or participate in the middle of the United States," said the Czech Trainer.
On Wednesday, Vrba called as the last player of the Spanish leader of Luka Vah.
He admitted that it wasn't easy to decide, and the other center polytheists looked at it.
I decided that Luke was a perspective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very complicated, but I am standing behind it," Vrba to Vah submitted.
What about Shural?
Let's see what's going on with Lata.
It is not concluded that in the case of health problems, the nomination could be changed.
The weekend, for example, the liberal Joseph Schural, who gave hattrick, was a wonderful work.
Of course, they are players who show the form last time.
We'll see how David Lafat will be on it.
In the case when I can be available in the middle, I don't believe that I can't nominate any of the players who were in Czech Lisa," Vrba said.
Today the afternoon is expected to represent the train on Strah, then in a classic pre-scale trend before the bridge with the United States on the Year, which will be opened for the fans and then will follow the autogramia.
Refuge with America is played in the middle of 20:15 and a national team in it will strive for premium winning under Vrba.
In the preceding three prepared stocks, he saved two mixtures and once spent.
The Qualification Conflict with the Netherlands is then on the 9th September from 20:45.
The fish goes to the Netherlands to Italy
The worm is that he has more time to train in the past.
It's a benefit when you've got players eight days and you're able to fix with them some things that we've never had so much time before.
Now we will be able to focus on it, and we'll be able to prepare the best for the Netherlands," he praised the Vrba.
The Netherlands will present themselves in Prague on Thursday in Italy, and the duel will personally follow the former temporary representative shot Joseph Peschice.
He gives us information from the backup.
But it's just about him, we'll have a cup and a lock, and we'll get it out.
To Netherlands, a new trainer comes, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba said to bronze medalists from a recent world championate.
According to the very soiled prices of residences during the winter period, the most increased in the last seven years.
According to the index of residence values in the Australian main town of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, the residence price increased in August by 1,1 %, the Agency introduced on Monday.
Increasing has resulted in the total growth in June, June and Sarp to 4,2 %, the maximum increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price growth was decreased by 10,9 %, more than twice per year until August 2013, however, the profits were not equally distributed in the country.
The RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless indicated that Sydney and Melbourne are on the market.
The RP numbers show that the residence prices in Sydney have increased by 16,1 % last year while the price in Melbourne was 11,7 %.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin were the most strongest markets with the increase in prices in the average between five and six per cent.
On the other hand, Canberra was located, which harmed by the State to reduce expenditure and where the prices increased only by 1,4 % during the year.
Lawless said that when the jaro is now started, the next months will increase the possibility of sale, which will be “real test” for the market.
“As regards the sustaining high-measured sales, generally the high-quality of sales and lower rates, it is likely to increase the residence value during the next three months”, he said.
My father never took me.
He never told me, "I have you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaica in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in reality had a cold relationship.
Henry tests the comedition, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the series Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixed reggae and rape and melodie is optimistic.
But Henry had to advise some of the unfair insights of the childhood.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a "based" terapie and now he thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew that very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have only heard his voice: “Stop with this wisdom.
Let your sister go in the room.
Shut up!
Look at the cricket.
My elders Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were growing up with him, walking in the bar and assembling things like the face of a bird with a beer or a nice beer in the cricket.
I've never spoken like this with him.
Most of my life was a serious guy in the kitchen, reading the news.
Recently Henry visited the Dudley Slavara, and although the subminans were better than at the dad's time, he saw what life he had to be for.
Today there's something more light, but it's still dark, dark, dark labyrinth, where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and smoke.
Daddy went to the van and just lied there, then he heard how quickly he began to sing for himself, because he smiled out of itself.
When I went around, I realized that he was doing this for years to enjoy a family, and I started to appreciate it more.
Yet, Henry lived in childhood without family love.
Dad didn't hurt anyone, he didn't say, "I have you."
When Mom was sick and died, we began to say, "I have you, I have you, I have you."
His daughter Billie, who had Dawn French, allowed him to enjoy the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I have you?"
Don't worry about me!
Dad, I have 22!
S Dawn French.
Why shouldn't they be friends?
It's a great mom.
With France who was married 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
It's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had a sugar.
It was one of the things she killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of big overweight, and they started to show the symptoms of sugar, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started walking into a great fitness centre, and I had to keep a dramatic diet to save the symptoms.
It's very hard.
It's not called.
No one wants to eat the dark.
The change in the direction of Henry's career is probably reflected in his elegant, short-conserved brass.
After he had been recognized from his criticism for his Othella, he went into the funeral.
She followed the Commissary full of myths and Ploty August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sidcomes and comedies that filled his hectac work and life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in the fabric.
DJ noticed him on the floor of a man's pardon, and wrote about him in a talented competition of New Faces.
His television career began in the half of the 70s: “I was the only black imitant/comic in the television long ago.”
He learned about the trail.
In addition to the public, I had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to think of functioning whispers, to be stars and to television, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager has owned the right to the famous production of the Black and White Minstrel Show, the funeral of the program in which the herds were stuck for blackness, Henry finally spent five years of his comedic.
My family was no longer awesome for that.
I want to never happen, but I don't stop it.
Although it was a special and crazy position, I worked on big scenes and tried to work with the dave.
What was “years and years assessed the British main product of television”, but it was also the "grotesy parodies of blackness".
In the 1980 ’ s, Henry worked in alternative comedial crossings and represented positions that were mixed and celebrated by the British Black Culture.
The Lenny Henry Show started to send in 1984, and in the 90s, he was well known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedial series of Chef!.
The next decades took his advertising, documents, television series and roles in films, but after his serial LennyHenry.tv on BBC in 2008, he said: "So what you're going to do now, Lene, it seems like you've been locked on one place, or you're going down from the road."
The next line was a documentary order on Radio 4 called What's So Great About... - What's so great for...?
It was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy at Shakespeara.
We didn't do it at school, and I thought it was something for a white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone with whom we were talking in order, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't mind if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all have Shakespear like that.
Henry offered twenty lines of Othell's final word for the document, and he was already in it.
I felt that I could.
It's like it'd add to me a courage.
"It's about it. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn text, find something about it.
So the trial was strong, and before I read the game for months and months.
And it was successful.
It seemed to be waiting for the shoes that happened.
Soon he started playing in the Commissary full of mills.
I was once in the National Division, I couldn't believe it.
One minute I thought, "You changed."
It happened to the technical commitment and Henry instinctly felt that he had to take the responsibility for the public party.
"The story in the head said to me, 'Before the computer is corrected, you have to buy them ten minutes.'"
Instead of the divational register noticed that the presentation would continue as long as the problem is resolved.
I went out of the cave, and something in me said, "Hmm, thanks to God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotech in Duchess Theatre
Teaching the Plots text was a challenge.
Panica's pretty good, he adds a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like God's sign that says, "You should do this."
Of course it says by a sound voice.
So I'm staying at that.
I've got it really.
I'm in the experiment.
However, Henry remains the brain of the comedian - all the time our conversation interruptes the humoral exhibitions when it comes and comes from the role of the imitator.
I decided not to stand up, because to have satisfaction from the room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a blind box.
Sometimes, if I want, I'm doing Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy as before.
I wondered if he's still organizing a stand-up tournament.
It's glad to sit in a room with a register who helps to give up the start, the end and the end of the road - I don't think I'd like to give it sometimes.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm enjoying herotic.
It's fun.
You're still talking about stories, what's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers the State officials in order to celebrate non-existent employees
Kenya started with the biometric registration of all its State officers to try to remove from the government's payment list of non-existent employees.
According to the statement of the Government, employees who are not registered in the next two weeks will not be paid.
The Government believes that thousands of people will be paid even after they left the State service.
After the Office was taken in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised that he would restrict corruption in the State administration.
The audit carried out in this year showed that the State comes at least one million dollars (700 000 euros) at payments for non-existent employees and further disuse of official power.
The Government has a doubt that payments are continued to be placed on the bank and after the death of employees or after the dead of the State administration, the reporter BBC from the main town of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebus.
All State officials shall be delivered to the Identification Centre for the next two weeks, where their data will be bioometric mentioned, shall be reported in the statement of the Government.
Next, he says that everyone who doesn't leave without any excuses will be removed from the paying list.
"In the establishment of public services, this measure will contribute significantly to its accommodation and will also be used to clear the payment list at both levels of governments and will address the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waigur, the Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Decades of Turkish police arrested for "support" against government
Local media claim that in Turkey there was a suspicion of the "support against government" of 33 police officers.
The police office, then, did not mention the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, there were fourteen highly established officers.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigation, focused on government officers at the time of four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police were arrested for data organization of crime gang and telephone audience.
The Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan (in that time the president of the Government) signed their negotiations as part of the action of the Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to Ukraine to school
Most schools in Ukraine opened again on Monday (1 September) after the years of vacation.
This day is traditionally important for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the President of the Government of Arsenia Jaceňuk led his daughter to school.
In this case, he informed the present journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that it was decided to protect the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools, the traditional ceremonie was performed to 1 March.
Not throughout Ukraine, there's peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the United Ukrainian front, has to fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukov, a teacher at the school in Slovenia, visiting Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russia.
We hope that there will finally be peace reached, and that children will gain the advantages that will be beneficial for them in the future.
The day of the school is traditionally celebrated so that children are clothing of the wheat, bringing the ballons, and the factors give flowers.
In Rona Fairhead, BBC may have found a boss for hard time
The glorious cloud of the world of banking, media management and internal concerts will be held with it to conservate the party.
Sam has experiences from the front lines.
The carrier started in the constant company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Medical World of Pearsons.
Seven years was the Executive Director of Financial Times. She resigned her youngest colleague in the mother's company Pearson's.
It's said that her distance was near to a million frees.
Her political portfolio is also large.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former leader of BP when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: it became a adviser of the Government.
Her husband is a former member of the city Council.
In May, I described the work of the manager as a catch with the way.
Not only that BBC is a large and split entity in the center of public life, but there is also a internal paradox in its structure.
Corporation turns to two directions: inside the top level of the BBC's own leading hierarchie, but also out to the vote of publicity in the periods of disaster when things do not work.
It's a very unsatisfactory monopol, which requires a basic reform.
But the manager would risk that he would come into a company complicated as a Chinese dinasty, distribute it and prepare himself for work.
It's a hard challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, many people would see how BBC decreases - her power, her finance - and how her status is revised.
With the extent of competition and the new doubt of old certainty, the conceitionary payments for BBC will be increasingly dangerous without negotiation.
By a short amount of 145,50 if the British public each year buys a share in something that certainly is the biggest media business in the world.
BBC reports the good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of household, and everyone is only 40 pens per day.
Furthermore, BBC’s rate is obvious: 53 % of the beneficiaries exceed 31 % before ten years.
The BBC services models have changed: Today my newspapers are shown on the mobile phone and on the orders I've spent can look at iPlayer.
But BBC continues to remain very loved and emotional institutions.
He needs an accurate manager - I hope she's found one.
Texasian Perry's aware that a wretchful twit has not accepted
Tweet of the official Twitter Twitter of the Texas, Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained a terrible picture of the Democratic State Representative, which initiated Perry's criminal accusation of the disuse of power.
Tweet was recently deleted and was published on Perry’s ́t another one that was removing from previously.
He went out of my cup that wasn't authorised.
"I don't agree with the two, and I stopped it," he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to questions immediately.
Although the twitters were sent from Perry's official office, there is no one who is responsibility for his administration.
Previous twot published an unlimited, humorous image of the State Representative Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, which was deceived in April 2013 for drinking.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused the payment of cups for her office, which is Perry, the possible candidate to the President in the elections of 2016, brought this month before a large report in Austria.
The title in the Twitu stated: "I'm not conducting with three times higher alcohol levels in blood than the limit allowed... but if so, I'm sorry for Perry's responsibilities for this."
I'm the greatest democratic in Texas.
The Lehmberg's office was not conducted in investigation against Perry.
In his care, Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonia, who was appointed by the Republican Court.
Perry was searched for an innocent and he called a tax, political manevre.
His implied legal team requested the judge who observed the case to refuse the accusation because the use of the laws for the courts of the service officer in Texas history is contrary.
Perry canceled the payment of 7.5 million dollars from the State Fund for the department of public interests which has a seat in Travis County and has a corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The refusal was a formal complaint to the left-oriented group of civil activists.
Perry's official's active - and sometimes he's glorifying.
After the end of his presidential campaign in Iowa in 2012 in the fifth place in the committee of his side, Perry replied to speculation that he could already end, two with a own campaign that runs near the sea, and said, "That's me, South Caroline!"
According to Berkeley, the market with residence returns "to normal"
One of the most prominent London developer companies warned that the market with residence in South East England was “returned” to the normal level of activity.
The main town was the subject of high requests and growing prices and increased interests from the credit bublin were added to the introduction of the hypoteque limits in June Bank of England.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and President of the developer company for Berkeley clients on Monday, said: “So the beginning of the current budget year, the market from the top point in 2013 returned to the normal level of transaction. It adds that it provides “stable employment”.
Londry's market with residence was good, because the buyers were bought in the main town.
According to the catastrophic authority only in the past year, the price in the town was 18,5 %, whereby the average of 6,7 % in England and in the whole Wales were overwhelmed.
The average sales prices of the private, available and student residence from Berkeley were approximately five years old and at the end of April were spent to 423,000 litres.
However, because of strengthening the liberty, they have not been so attractive in the past months for Londres' incapacity buyers - some of them have also threatened the introduction of new taxes from the failure and the possibility of "satural data" with which the policy came before the parliamentary elections in May next.
The London reality officer Foxtons warned last week that the dubble market review of hypoteches, which represented more urgent payment rules, also late during the second half of the year in the market growth in the sales of freedom and prices.
The new data Bank of England showed a decline in a number of approved hypoteches in June, which indicates that the residence market is quiet.
Hamptons International, another reality officer, has decreased on the basis of the fact that the prices of homes have already started to fall, its prediction of the increase in the prices of Londres' failure for 2015 to 3 %.
The volume of transactions, according to the WA Ellis reality office, has been reduced every year for fourth in London's lovingst quarters such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
Nevertheless, the request for residence in the main town for Berkeley's blessing was because it increased the preparation for forward sale for more than 2,2 billion dollars.
Pidgley added: “The purchase after that, well looking in a good place, remained the same and the forward sale was maintained."
In June, the company reported that since the beginning of the year to the end of April, it sold 3 742 possibilities, as far as the third of the crisis in 2007.
Annual winning has increased by 40 % to 380 million dollars, the expenditure of 18 % to 1,6 billion euros.
On Monday before the annual meeting of Pidgley said it was predicted that Berkeley's annual expenditure would be in accordance with the current market expectation.
Analysts agree that the annual winning before translation will be $450 million.
The Berkeley action was stopped at the London Burge on the afternoon on 23,96 litres.

Jennifer Lawrenc comes to the 85th Cen Academy.
Photos of Oscara Jennifer Lawrenc's photos were avoided on the Internet for the hacker, which claimed that he had a "list" photo of additional hundreds of starting hackers.
The speaking stars of the films "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrences are true and hacker criticized for "a manifest privacy destruction".

Victoria Justice knows from the serials of the Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" cabinets. On Twitter she reported: "These are my details, people."
It's better to get it in the puzzle.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that the speaker of the pop stars Ariana Grande said that data photos would be true.
Excellent demonstration of the loving new Roman Howard Jacobson on love and letter “J”
It was the best way to describe it, they gradually distributed as a carton box that someone left on the rain.
Only from time to time, a woman told him that she was too serious, complex, unusual, isolated, and maybe a little hurtful.
And then she cut off his hands.
He's just allowed it.
He was able to pick up like a jack, yeah.
The final sacrifice of this ability was the beginning of a merciful fleet, which promised more than usually that he would be deceived from a single life - suffering and may also give him such satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a cross-crash with a deep hair and a flying heart from the village to the northern island, which was even more delicate and unhosty than Port Reuben.
On the south, the elderly partner, who Kevern believed that her grandfather, who had inherited the property in a low but beautiful valley called, eventually, the Paradise valley.
There's no one in the house for a few years.
The trumpets were prosecuted, in the vans were dead bullets, as if they thought that the place belonged to them, the garden was grown and flooded at the great heads of grass.
The house looked like a chaloup of children's stories, tremendous, and similarly anxious, with a full secret.
Author Profile: Howard Jacobson, whose roman "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations on Man Booker Price 2014.
More choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on a long grass crossing and holding their hands, enjoying unexpectedly warm jail afternoon, unexpectedly loading a public station, which the country retained a comfortable music and quieting news, when in that regarding her broken crossed feet, he remembered the old song of a forgetted black comic, who had always listened to his father’s roles.
You have too big feet.
For their natural agressively, such songs have no longer played.
They weren't disabled. It was nothing prohibited. They just didn't play.
They helped them get to a decade, just as the decade word alone.
People’s whisper proved that they would never have rules and positions outside the law, and as people about books, they choose memories in which the poor will become riches, kitchens and gracious Romans, so in music they choose balls.
Kavern left the day and started playing on an imaginary piano and a brushing, comic voice, and sing a series of Aillinin big walks.
The second doesn't understand.
"It was a favorite song from the jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father did when he wanted to cut a letter of j before he went out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was still small.
Father told him he played with his father.
When you're at the words that started on j, you didn't get two fingers before the mouth, you're the penny.
It wasn't too funny that time, and it wasn't even now.
He just thought it was expected from, it was all.
He had to explain what I was.
Ailin never heard anybody.
Not even me, even though it wasn't just placed outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvization came out of the mode.
There was only a place in life for one "if".
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to find out where they'd end exactly.
That's the same in the humor.
His invisibleness took people into the nerves.
And I was the humor's song.
Although he didn't hear about Sammy Davis Junior until ten years, Kevern knew me from his father's local CD collection.
At least, but Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her mother, she could not remember the time when the favorite songs were not black.
No law or pressure, too.
The free company is the one in which each part of its gratitude - with the gratitude of those who were a happy event of dealing - agree with the principle of the group of thanksgiving.
People of Afro-Karibian powder with temperament and constitutions went for the bathroom and athletic, so they sang and flew.
People from Indian subcontinent, like the nature of electricity, have taken responsibility for no family without phone.
The police who remained were installers, the Greek, who remained, missed vessels.
Those of the States of Perish Yellow and Levant, whose parents did not leave the land, while it was done that which was STALO, KDYBY SE TO STALO - feared that they were accused of joining them into the fire, in fact feared that the fire was the next holiday - they opened the restaurant where he sold the labs and the fuels of the water fums, they didn't warn themselves and the inactivity was slowly fed them.
Everyone according to his talent.
Because she listened only to the ballady, Ailinn was hard to understand how the simple words that Kavern just sang could come to music.
The music was the exhibition of love.
"They're not simple," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people who have too big feet.
My dad never hurt anyone, but this song had any idea.
He talked too much, but the unfortunate garden was providing an illusion of security.
Besides sounds, the word couldn't be avoided.
The ship still doesn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say that it was funny, but he was trying to give his presence two fingers back to his mouths.
She thought she was wonderful.
"He seemed funny," he finally said.
She incrediblely cut her head and shaded Kever's look.
In the whole world, there was nothing other than the wounds of her hair's hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think," she doubtfully said.
But that still doesn't explain why you're sing to me.
She seemed to be disappointed.
Do I have too big feet?
He looked again.
She's walking so no longer.
Maybe a little kitchen...
You say you hate me because I've got too thirsty kidneys?
I hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
She could say, "I love you," but it was too quick.
"Your dust boys just touch me," he tried.
I'm so tired.
That didn't happen.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be amazed, he often took it into the mood, because, as his father, he shot the cup needed to make it possible to break the cruelty that he had in the tissues.
Maybe his father was cruel mentally.
Maybe he was mentally cruel Kavern.
Although I'm a good eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was thrown up from the bed, covered the wine and smoked the wine.
Beskin wine, so drinking couldn't be for it.
She seemed to have a third like palm trees in the storm in her disturbance.
"I'm deceived that you're stupid," she said...
Until it doesn't touch me.
He was so sorry for his unbeliefful words, so because of the fear that she had in the eyes of when she stood against him.
Did she think she'd get her out?
She didn't talk to him about life on a cold northern half of the island where she was grown, but she didn't doubt that it was the same thing in the foundations as here.
He had the same wide and ice ocean about them.
Likewise men, then, CO SE STALO, even more inevitable and more disturbing than their fathers, feeders and cazis worlds, were increasingly bloomed from the economy to the economic, prepared to stretch up the hand of any woman that would refuse or excite them.
Blbec?
If they're looking forward, they'll take their feet!
First to anointed her - to anointed it became the most current expression for erotic distress between man and woman: the opposite of the mild ballad of love that he cut - first they anointed her, and then eat one murder.
According to Kever's opinion, it's too cultural, because it's been a violent act on itself.
Ailinn Solomons told him to go.
He got out of the bed as an old man.
She felt hungry, but the tissue of her shame surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know.
She looked away, as if she was looking at him from the window in the watch, a man who had found what he had caused.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
Her heart touched him and for all men generally, unless a few of them killed it.
The man turned away from her, the brass, the shameful, the wounded, all the fighting left him - why did she seem that this view well knows, even though she couldn't save the only moment until today she had ever seen it?
Ailinn Solomons, again alone, looked at his feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and supervised two-twenty-year research working in Ofnov, the State Monitoring System, prepared a short article on the survival of easily and medium-term violent acts in the country where its destruction or direct stop was most expected to be acquired of enough money and energy.
“It was done so much, and much more has to do, ” she wrote, “in order to calm up the native aggressiveness of people who were fighting in many battles and gained a lot of them, especially in the swift, hardly available places of the country, where even through the church spices of the living areas of human welfare of historical beauty was manifested only rarely.”
However, some things are not replaceable.
It might seem to be the highest of the church, the lower is the pudding.
Inhabitants breathe over emotional ballades, keep disgusting stories and announce that they are firmly in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that old brutality remains as strong as in citizen agglomerations, but evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace, in the streets, and even in sports games is manifested a new and attractive happiness.
"There is a tendency to be too magnificent," she said.
I would encourage you to read less Romans.
Esme Nussbaum's head was cut off.
I have to ask, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to answer it," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesb?
Esme re-confirmed her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Next silence.
"I don't wonder why," said Rabinowitz finally, "but I should have something against the atheists, lesbs, or feministes.
We have no prejudice on this work.
We're serving an unprecedented company.
But some kind of surprise that is absolutely acceptable and appreciable about himself may sometimes draw the judgment as you did.
Obviously, you are self-invited to the church - things that you call "krute" and "brutal" could also interpret others as the exhibition of natural power and energy.
Continue to resolve what happened, when it happened, as if it had happened, last night, he prepared the land with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
After his head on the light table, Ofnova had been sent to the world for the last fourteen or more.
Smile on your neighbor, care about your partner, listen to the balls, come to the musicians, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the song word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I understand your winning," Esme Nussbaum replied silently when she was sure that her surrounded ended, "and I don't say that she didn't hurt as we think she was deceived.
My fear is, in particular, that if we are warned about this, we repeat the same error that led to what happened, when it happened.
But this time, we're not sure we're going to ventile on the ends.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingers of his fingers.
That would mean an unnewful patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when the steps that may have been done and may not have done your parents, you're described as errors.
You're too far in talking about that they've ventiled their "resurrection" and "uncertainty" on "others".
I shouldn't have to say to someone in your place that we don't talk about "on" and "their".
There was no "we" but no "on".
We just know that it was about chaotic times.
“In those who, if we are sincere to ourselves, ” Esme collected courage, “No one is without sin.
I don't accuse anyone.
Whatever it was just or not what happened, it happened.
That was before.
It's not what to add -- we agree together.
And as there is no wine that would be given to someone, there are no things that should be done, nor if the correction is appropriate and possible.
But what is the past, and they learned from it?
The past is, and they forgot it.
If I can add something to that--
Luther Rabinowitz split the fingers of his fingers.
"I will take your message in mind," he said and left it.
On the day when he went to work as a habit, the motorcyclist struck her, who found it on a trailer by the way that the college students described as "brutal and swimming".
The events are going to be.
The Army of the Kingdom of Lesoth states that no puzzle plans - the President of the Government remains in South Africa
The military centers of the Kingdom of Lesoth claimed that they would organize a battle after the government's distortion, and they claimed that they acted against the police underscious of the trial of political fanatic arms.
The president of the Government of Thomas Thabane fled from the country and said that the soldier circumcised his official seat and occupied the government buildings in the main city of Maser.
After he announced that they threatened death, the premier with his family went to the neighborhood of the South African Republic.
Major Ntle Ntoi said that it wasn't a puzzle, but the answer of the army to the "political fanatics", which the police tried to arm.
"The Government of defense members of the Kingdom of Lesotha today acted after a number of reports of information service reported that several groups of police are shown in a range of groups planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who wanted to be made in the country," said the vote of America.
The speaking South African Government Monyela Monyela said that military action looked like an attempt to decrease the government.
“Although no one has declared that the Governing authority has been acquired by force, the lesoth defensive components of the flag of the State Return shall, accordingly, take action. ”
The military representatives of the Kingdom of Lesoth said that the soldiers returned to their cazars on Sunday and was quiet in the main city.
During Thaban's independence, the Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane declared that it was the most important attack for my attempt to fight corruption in the land.
Since June, Thabane has stopped the Parliament's meeting for internal disputes, he is held in Lesoth.
He announced that, despite a reverse statement, he doesn't recompense his government negotiations.
Verb in the euro is at a minimum of thirty months
The growth of the production was reduced by a minimum of thirty months, according to the clearly followed investigation in August in the euro.
The final index of the purchase managers in the euro (PMI) from June 51.8 was decreased in August to 50.7.
The number above 50 means expansion.
The new negotiations have occurred, and the companions have damaged the increased pressure between the EU and Russia for Ukraine.
The numbers shall be entered from the quarter meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets will want a plan from the bank to arrange with the remote health of the euro and with a threat of deflation with inflation of 0.3 %.
Speculations were shown that the ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he considers the quantitative release of the euro, similar to which the United Kingdom and the United States have reached during the financial crisis.
"Although at least the growth is better than no growth, a heavy effect that has growing economy and geopolitic failure on the manufacturer, it is still more visible," said Rob Dobson, the main market economy.
The German SME, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, has fallen to a minimum of 11 months 51.4.
In the second largest area economy, France, the PMI fell at 46.9.
Anxiety is about France, Italy has gone back from the expansion of the stagnation.
The knowledge of the creation force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands is also not too quiet," said Dobson.
The reduction of the development is probably attached to the analysis expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax stimulations.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economic in IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing about the production of the purchase managers to say is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
Addition: The producers in the euro have a very difficult life at the present time, because the increased geopolitical efforts - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds to more difficulties in many countries.
This increased injury has been evidently incurred - and mostly in the confidence of consumers, which probably causes some negotiations to be released or even cancelled, especially the costs.
He noted that, as “now more likely”, the ECB will finally have to carry out the form of quantitative release,“as long as we expect that it will only be concerned”.
Ten years of age of survivors: Ten years of fear from the occupied school of children still suffer
Ten years ago, Czech radicals in the school in South Russia were arrested as hands of thousands of people.
During the suffering that endured three days and shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, of whom more than half were children
We returned to the hall, and we looked for some of the victims that were killed during the beast in the school.
Exactly ten years after the distressing school occupation of 334 people, including 186 children, warned the herds last night before the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they took and killed the fanatic babies and parents, it seemed to be the deepest underground.
The opposite to the tragedy was the east and the west, which led to negotiation and future in this disaster accident.
After ten years, we returned to South Russia, and we searched for some of the victims that were unleavened in the school during the beast.
We have found young people who have suffered unfortunately, even though the raising of anger caused terrorists in them will continue to live.
What is their biggest desire?
In order to war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children as they were died - it's already done.
A girl who tries from a devastated school team
It was captured by the first Russian photographer Dimitrium Beliakov, as only in the bottom of the undergrounds trying to go into the destructed school body after the bomb exploded.
Aida's deadly looked for her mother Lariss, who is now 40.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they survived.
"A certain woman told me to flee and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida that time.
I had the legs from blood.
I got up and went out of the kids to find my mother.
He saved her a soldier.
After some operations, she thought she had been wholehearted, but last night she said: “The pains came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another operation.
I've been in my knees.
Her goal is to be a dental to help people as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it has not decided to destroy it," she decided.
"I just did this and it couldn't change.
Once a year, I'm going to the bodymate to remember those who stay there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk to your friends about it.
This pain is too big.
My best friend and the future companion of Jer Gapoe's class killed there.
As little, we played together and imagined how we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to give up until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think of my family.
She says she didn't forget the prison, but she was a little blue every year.
I am sure that so many people in the world still remember what happened, and we are very thankful for the help we received from British and other countries.
When I'm looking at the Internet, I'm looking forward to school windows, I'm saying that people'll see her first, they'll understand the disaster and prohibit it to repeat.
The boy who ran the rain and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (in Russia the children begin in seven years) and he survived a classical school training in the subject of his mother Tamary.
At that time, the seven-year-old said, "Mommy told me that if the explosion had been, I had to sleep on the ground and keep it in hand."
After the explosion, he thought Mom was dead.
She said to him, "Return."
He feared that he was dead, fled and saw a paid bathroom on the road, falling the baby in his hand, and they fled a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who took him out, said, "Give me that his mother was dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
At the time, Tamar came to freedom and lied in the hospital with a hurt foot, and she thought her son was dead.
After their meetings again, she said: “I wanted to be happy.
I couldn't believe that.
He came in and took me.
Da ́ later he fled to London (after the disgusting news of the World), where he was the most recent Prime Minister Tony Blaire and his wife, Cherie, announced by Bernardo's Children's winner.
"The fear comes back every day, but I would like to stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say the raises are already blue.
I remember that I've lost all my guns to play.
Today, but I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I don't have any problem with it.
"I don't be afraid to go from the body to the body, but I don't think of myself.
I'm looking for the kids with whom I played in the court and who didn't get out.
We'll never say they're killed or died.
We're saying they've stayed in the body.
I remember well to fly to London, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted, and how I got a cabriolet.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where he and his friends suffer for war as he suffered.
The fear comes back every day, but I'd like to stop thinking about it.
"I am very sorry for everyone who has to be so scared," says Da ́, who has participated in voluntary activities in the apartment last week.
It's very much to help.
One time I want to work at the police, and I hope they'll take me in the next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine it?
I remember that quiet right after the attack, there were no kids who would cry and run here, and it was quiet for a few months.
Life remembers the way with Damire to London.
When I told our story in London, people wept.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can eat their support.
She was thankful to Cherie Blair and her opinion for the price granted and for the opportunity to go to London under 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that although it's ten years ago, I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how Da's helped me and Da's.
I'm wondering how Da's got silence at the bar, and so they called all Russian restaurants.
I also remember how he was playing in the restaurant with the chickens, Da ́ shot on them from the water gun and they fled and played with him.
And it was just a month from the fear.
I was surprised how the Brits wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still believe that the world hasn’t changed to better in these ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, every day people die, and I think it was, and there's still a lot of kids killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think the war for many people is just something in the news that they will hear when they hurt or do something else.
I know what people use, what it's for fear.
I still feel it.
Nothing changed, people still want to kill one another, it's so sad.
Da's grown up, and he's from nice and quiet boy, it's not all aggression or exciting.
For example, he doesn't care about the battle. This doesn't care about him.
I know he doesn't like it, but he's very close to six partners, and he's going to the bodywide and burning the lights there.
When he was less, he had problems with that -- I'll imagine how he ever lied on a bullet with the face turned away from us, and sometimes he lied so hours.
He didn't sleep, he had open eyes.
I also remember that he's cut off all his weapons or other weapons to play. Dad's 17th today, he's higher than I, beautiful, smart and healthy.
I can't believe that I've been sure for a few hours he's dead and I'll never see him anymore.
When I was remembering after the explosion and stood up on my feet, I looked around and saw that peak, and the human bodies were all over there.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have the chance to survive this peak.
“I remember I cried ‘Damire, run, run!’, but I was convinced that he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and fled.
So our life's going to be divided from others.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
A boy whose appeal after an attack became a symbol of fear in a
Reconfort: Overliving Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatimou after the attack in 2004, o Grigorij today
When he fled for life after the shooting of the Czech terrorists, he was in his bloody face a furious fear.
His cup was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, took him in the school first day and quicked his older son Vladimir to the university.
"I went two minutes before the terrorists went to the court, so my boy stayed there three days alone," she said.
Not completely alone because we had a family there, but everyone died there.
He just survived my Grigory.
As the date comes near, it is still hard to think and talk about it.
It's not the only day, and they don't have the tragedy.
We haven't seen it's been a long time, I'm feeling that it was yesterday, some moments I'm going back.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Continuing to return: Photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was stared as socha (right)
I'm wondering how the day of Grigory was greatly happy to school, he said he wanted to cover his artist.
He's alive, I learned when I saw him in the television.
In San Marino, there's even the socha of the paying Grigory.
Grigory's looking at this cube, and we've been locked in the bookbook at home.
I understand it, but I also think that through that picture people around the world think of the pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important to do this again.
“I doubt that sometimes we will learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still investigated, but no one will ever find the truth.
Now they're investigating this boeing havary in Ukraine.
Can we ever find out what was the cause?
This world's waiting for something too bad.
"I don't understand why, because when people ask you, no one wants war as possible?
Ten years are nothing for such a pain.
And at least a little forgot, for ten years.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had to attack the night sea, but then it improved.
Then, when I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and friends who killed.
That's why when he's close to the 1st September, I'm going to the bodywide.
Remember a friend from childhood.
It's hard for me to get into that body, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is the past.
I won't forget that, but they don't get away.
My life's going on.
I finished school for years and started studying medical at the University of Vladikavkaz.
It's to be a cardiochirurg.
I first wanted to go into the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't be for health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't go.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, although they kept him at the feet of a murderer terrorist.
Example: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderer terrorist, yet he was able to survive
When the attack was full of the run, he was arrested in the body, sitting near the bomb at the feet of a murder terrorist.
It's a real miracle he's survived.
"We look like it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to be a Federal Security Service agent, but because of the hurt that he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I've cut off my head.
Now I'm a elder, and it's saying that children with bad lives can get better - I have to say that it's not true.
"In 2006, I went to psychology and then was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd forget.
In 2005 - the year after - it was the first and the last thing I entered into the bodywide again.
I'm cut off.
I'm never going there again and don't want to follow me, please, to show you where I'm sitting on this well-known image.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on the notebook with his photos made in the hospital after an attack
This pain is great and I'm not with me every day.
Friends think I don't like to think about it or talk and never ask me at school.
With regard to physical health, I'm okay.
I have to be careful about my gentlemen I've hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
But even so, for health, I couldn't stop and study the FBS academy in Petrohrad as I wanted.
I sent my documents to them with medical reports, and they answered me that it was impossible.
My next favor is animals, so I've got the veterinary.
I made the second year there.
It teaches how to treat all animals from “cook after coffee”.
He said: “I know that I never want my child to talk about it.
It's not something that the kids should be talking about, and it's not something they should live.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
He's inside, and he's worried with a nearby year.
I'll participate in the ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be more stronger for it, because he was there for a department from me.
I was waiting for home and couldn't help him.
I'm so thankful to God for returning him to me.
It's staying with us.
Gregory is grown today, but the fear is going on.
It's hard to accept when something happens to you so badly unjust.
He's a boy, he's got a sport, but he can't do it because of his gentlemen.
He's got a few operations, he can go, but he can't be used.
I would say that about 50% of this day he's already overcome, but to convince it completely and not forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors killed, and this pain is only to be harmful.
I lost a lot of people I had and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the biggest gift that God could give me, but I'm lost of murder.
I know the families in which other children were born, but also the widows that haven't happened again.
It's hard to accept that life's going on, even if you don't want.
I'm never gonna forget how much my heart was shot out of the horse when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world, wars in other places.
What are people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is now close to our country, and I can try to believe.
In the past, we were a friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and kids suffer, I'm sure there were many children in Ukraine and they'll be killed yet.
When all the rebels could be able to get together and throw them away, how far it's going.
Alyona Tscaeva, 10 / 10
Children brought to security special command
Saved: Alion Tskaeva is brought to a secure Russian special command (left).
Now it's ten (right) and it doesn't mean to tragedy.
In 2004, the world was thrown after a rain when a little Alion was put out in the hands of the Russian police officer in the Beslan prison.
The terrorists left her, however, in school in prison, their thirty - year - old mother, Christian sister and brother Makhar left her.
However, the mother and sister of Alyon died during the massacre.
Her brother Russlan married again, and with her new wife, she had a girl named Christin after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyon, who is now ten, doesn't make an attack and has grown from her a big and happy girl.
A close friend declared that “is a great happy family, and Alyon and Makhar are beautiful children.”
Ruslan is a beautiful father and wants children to keep away from the wedding that he's in the ten years.
You can understand why.

4 types how to arrange better and videos under water
You are always interested in focusing or intaking under water, you have a large selection of equipment.
The most important options are the compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the outdoor camera of type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which is about $300.
I've ordered these bills to celebrate a few photographs in the family, all were less than $350.
It's one of the equipment you use, but the best results are applied to a number of rules.
Check your equipment.
Although you have a waterful camera, make sure the battery and other parts are closed.
Further, set up the camera according to the type of photo or video you will arrange.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenary or toilet mode that optimizes the exposure on the darkness under water.
Before you leave it, see how deeply you can go to your equipment.
Some cameras are defined only to 5 degrees, Next to 50 to 60.
Read our fingerprint by purchasing and evaluation of digital cameras in running and waterful performance.
Make a few photos -- many of them will not go out.
Compact cameras have LCDs that will help you with composite photos, but outdoors do not have it.
Even if you have LCD, it'll be wrong to see and the composition of the record will be unpredictable.
So do more photographs.
The camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of photos with a quite different exposure, use it.
Keep close to the corner.
It's a deepest light poor.
It is possible, keep focused in the bassin, sea or sea near the level.
This will also allow you to catch more lights - with which you are deeper, less colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
It's a fine advice if you're looking at the sodium, but under the water it's still more important for the more tough light.
It is particularly important if you press outdoor camera: Such devices have usually a solid and width angle of a bottle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frames, you need to draw closer to objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality force had been able to change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As anestesiologist, he explained to his career that he would cause the disease and the treatment of sickness.
His wife believes that one of the people who looked for his help was a MI6, who had to live with the results of the torture that led him.
Lawson realized that while doctors concentrate on diagnosis and disease, patients treated in a mildness carefully interested in something else: pain.
On one day in 2007, however, it was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May that year.
I felt without energy.
He related to the symptoms of the throat and proved that he was untleaved and Juliet's wife included the records.
He said, "I want to do everything more before it comes."
When Juliet went to the service road a week, Lawson was unusual and unexpectedly disappointed.
Something wasn't okay.
His colleague made his rentgen.
Once two weeks ago, he lied in the French Al'ahs.
The results of the rentgen.
He had a mezotelium, an unhealthy cup, which cooks the throat or if the throat.
It is hard to determine what was their cause.
Although some kitchens will get cancer cancer, not all patients with cancer pulmonary.
Mezotelium, but it's different.
In all cases, it is the cause of the exhibition of azbest - the building material that was previously marked as “astray” but today knows that it is mortally dangerous.
It wasn't hard to ignore the most of us.
Azbest, finally, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of azbest is not used in British since the 60th years when it has entered into force the prohibition of use of azbest in the future.
Even at the time when azbest was used, only some groups of people came with him, such as isolations, builders, teachers and employers in ships.
Toxin used in a different era today is hard to seem to be scared.
Such selfishness, but it's not at the place.
As it is shown, the mezotelium epidemic is today in British.
The beginning of death on mezotels is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths for this disease annually are two times more than the victims of car accidents.
Beginning of death for the success of Mezotelium annually since 1980 and estimated death in the future in Great Britain
D·Why we just feel his injuries now, although the use of azbest has been illegal for years (all the species of azbest were finally prohibited by the law in 1999), it is that it is usually a few decades before the development of the mezotels.
The funeral in the form of mezotelium does not apply only to the veterinarians of the building industry.
Azbest was, and in many cases, it is still present in houses in which we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in business in which we buy.
It therefore does not respect social levels, riches, calls, or claims.
Private bags from London business houses after public school do not represent hiding.
Parliament is also full of asbesto.
Even the diseases in which we should be treated are the record of this mortal cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even make a isolation.
He tried to see where he could come to a contact with azbest.
Then he came to it.
"It is likely that a lot of azbest was in the Guy's Hospital towns where I used six years to practice," he wrote.
All - students, sisters, doctors, and returns - they used walks.
The question is how many of my moderns will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was the question that he had been able to answer.
“From four doctors who were in practice in Guy's Hospital and who later appeared to mezotelium in the past five years,” he noted in the letters in 2010, “I am the only one still alive”.
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was broken with the mezotelio when he was 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
To survive with this diagnose, it's not usual.
55 per cent of people with mezotelium will die until eight months after diagnosis.
The disease is mortal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are sick with the same disease?"
According to the British Presidency of Professor Julian Pete, the best estimation is that between 1970 and 2050, when the azbest epidemie is played in the United Kingdom, about 90,000 people die.
Most of them now have no idea that they will die in this way.
Azbest lobby in Quebec, Canada
In the loop of reviews of the courts, which often turn and require compensation, it shows how the power of the mezoteliomic grave has been expanded.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that she had insufficiently exposed Janice Allena asbesto.
She worked nearly nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched in two sales sections with clothing - one of the places was a flatboat of the company, trade at Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two kids who's over twenty.
"Before it happened," he says, "I have never heard about mezotel before, I've actually done something about asbest.
I never thought in the dream that I could be touched anyway.
There's not much people who do something about asbest.
It's not the asbest of one substance, but the group of six minerals.
The name was obtained by his fibrous structure, which gives him power and humility.
The six minerals were used in the building three.
Most often, in buildings today, it is possible to cryzotil, runningly known as a white asbest.
It was used in the middle panels, the ground walls, the boiler sticks and even in the forest area.
It is not as mortal as other forms of asbest, however, the EU and the WHO consider it as a “great health risk” that can cause death.
But it is more dangerous but it's a thick asbest (mosit) and blue asbest (crokydolit).
British was ever the world's greatest importer of azbest and experts claims that “is a convinced, but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of the high result of mezotelium [in the United Kingdom]."
Lady Marsk & Spencer was azbessed in a flat sale in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical sacrifice to mezotel, but Julian Peta's work shows that her story is not usual.
His study of patients states that “the essential part of the cases of mezotelium without a known exposure of azbest in the work or home was probably caused by the exhibition of azbest in ová”.
A significant part of this exhibition is caused by the “current use and dilution” of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
Goddard Consulting report, who examined the Westminster Palace, shows that neither people in the middle of the government have to imagine that they are possible for azbest.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that provides services and demands in the Parliamentary Committee's rooms to be contaminated with azbest, whose mortal flames could be distorted by something as unfair as “the strong air stream”.
The ministers are often accused of being concerned only about their own interests, but in this case it may be again the truth.
Although the Government of Parliament's Services continued to get the Westminster Palace “powerful medical certificate”, it is now calculated that it will need a million frees and a few years of work to examine the Parliament accurately, modernise electricity and remove azbest, and that, after the elections in 2015, the lawyers will be more than on the Green Lawyers in Westminster to sit in the University of the Conference Centre of Algeria II.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of azbest is not in accordance with any of the rules”.
It is not possible to say if this disaster will become life.
Now everyone can just wait.
One of those who never were able to determine when the azbest exposure came to them is Graham Abbott, doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) has suspected that azbest was established in the work in diseases.
"I worked in the hospital where the presence of azbest was shown," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
Clearly, but he remembers the day at the beginning of 2009 when he was capable of something like a winter.
He was 45, he was evening, and he was just at the operation.
I'm once divorced.
That's the point.
I was terrific.
I thought I wasn't going home.
Because he was a doctor, he realized that pain was out of the wound, the exhibitions around the wheel.
But just as Janice Allen had no need to think she was about mezotels.
Finally, he worked home a month.
The doctors made him rentgen and brought him a horrible cateter to remove the fluid they sent to the divorce.
Yet, they didn't determine diagnosis.
His condition was quickly improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, the symptoms have been returned, often after he has blowned and breathed.
In 2011, one of the Abbott patients with similar symptoms came to the operational salon and then was accompanied by mezotels.
However, Abbott did not have anything to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was over a few decades older and was in the work directly contacted with azbest.
In this case, the association was connected.
In September 2011, Abbott's status was reversible and his doctor completed his photos from the CT and the rentgen with the expert panel.
In 2011, precisely two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was in the room between the exhibition of the hot dust and the exhibition of the flash was introduced by the camera.
I'm optimist.
I have a tendency to take nothing too much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't care about it.
But Rachel, my wife, did you care.
The results of the biopsie arrived between birthdays and the New Year: "They told me that it was a mezotel."
Graham Abbott:
Abbott began to meet with his sisters from the Macmillan charitable organization, and one advised him to contact the lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the range of epidemics.
“The azbest was very useful, especially in large public buildings, which often have a azbest warm isolation in the tube,” he says.
In those buildings of azbest, now the disease begins to be manifested.
Thus, among the people now begins to address younger people who have no risk calls.
The most dangerous tubes of heat isolated azbest were injured in diabetes, so it was unlikely to threaten patients.
Of course, the members of the staff who passed by sutheren woods between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or eating in sutheren feeds (as often Graham Abbott) have certainly come to contact with the toxic substance.
As shown now, a few decades after the war of hospitals were places where patients could save life, but also a place that could threaten the life of the doctors who had treated them.
Asbest is removed today.
The bones of Bunsen's kitchen made themselves on azbest substances.
And it's not just about the disease.
Azbest was often used in offices, businesses, books and advisers for his excellent isolation and immortal property.
In schools, too.
Many azbests have already been built in the school.
Sometimes, the chemical students built Bunsen's chain on the azbest subhead.
The web pages were discussed with asbest issues in schools.
Injustices such as footwears, or sticks of rocks on the tools in our homes have currently contained azbest.
"Every of the industrial food built in a large number of homes," recalls Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his complaint against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with the azbest that a woman suffered with mezotelioom was reminded in the 70 ’ s of the battle of the garden.
So take care of how you're fighting the garden house.
I think the disease is untreated, the impact of the diagnosis is significant.
"It takes a while before it happens to you," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to the work and tried to continue, but I tried not to focus on what I'm doing.
I was in the operational room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I'd have to go away and arrange with myself.
Well, I'm not going to live on the other Wednesday.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As an unclean quantity of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt fatigued by the number of information that he had to arrange with.
"It was hard to understand all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I stay?"
I was told that twelve months.
I remember what I said: “Well, I don’t get to the other Wednesday.
That's it."
Mezotelium is particularly destructive, because the single mechanism of what keeps us in life - a single spirit -- is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mezotelium are caused by the exhibition of azbest.
Azbest makes big flames.
When the azbest breaks up and the flames gets inside, they can put themselves in the wheel, the flash-productors.
Azbest flashes are driving and can call cell mutation.
"Problem represents inspired azbest flames in the face of a glass," explains Professor Tom Treasure, cardiochirurg, who went to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was obviously designed asbesth, which is paradoxly leading centre in the treatment of mezotelium.
Treasure Lawson knows and has treated other patients who were probably exposed to azbest during the hospital practice.
The Treasure says that the azbest’s jewelry is reached into the pitch, and “soul breath is pressured on the side of the outdoor.
Their honor is from the beginning of the invasion.
The current treatment options used in other types of cancer are not so much collected.
For example, the operational ability is discussed.
According to some, she'd stand for a trial.
The treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the wounds," he says.
You're not getting a scalpel around her.
Cancer “too doesn't correspond to chemotherapy”, which even has“ equal effects” but doesn't treat.
"There is sometimes a person who survives cancer plc," says Treasure.
But, finally, everyone will die.
Unfortunately, some patients live much longer than they expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half year from his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still fights.
After discovering the mezotel, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years ago from his diagnosis, became individual support and adviser for the same people.
When they were calling, he said, "Good day, you've been calling to the centre of cancer."
"It was very positive," says Abbott.
He was still very active for four years ago.
At the beginning, Abbott offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months, and probably would take his life for only a month.
"I was stuck," he says.
I wanted to give it.
But Lawson, "he could show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue to be treated with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the Division of Hard Chirurgie in Guy's Hospital hospital.
"I had the benefit that I didn't have to wait until I was sent to him, but I just called there and they watched me," Graham admits.
The normal patient would have to get a garbage and have to accept his replacement.
In order to achieve the best available treatment, the question of money is key for patients with mezotelium.
But when different treatments finally fail to be unexpected, many patients have a further financial age - about the future of the family they leave here.
That's why they turn to courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse →P.
"Sidden 1898, asbest is harmful for health," Morgan says.
However, in the 60s, it was found that its very small amount could also represent a health risk.
And here we're going to meet the weakness of fire.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally were equipped, but according to Morgan, it was not a "complete balance" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mezotelium was the result of the azbest exposure in Guy's Hospital.
However, after the investigation of the case, speaker Guy's Hospital confirmed that “the injury in the incriminated suteren part was removed in the 90s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove azbest
The exhibition of the mortal asbest on one company or place of work - about decades after that - for patients with mezotelious effort to compensation was a major problem.
Many former employees have changed the owner or made up.
Evidence was lost.
And those who are now accused of defense have time on their side, and their companions are not determined.
In response to this fact, this year was approved a significant new legislation, which is easier for patients with mezotelium to assist balance, even if it is not possible to monitor their former employee.
The Law created a 350 million financial reserves that build a security and which is appointed to people after July 2012, which could prove that they were azbest, but they have no one to complain.
In such cases, 80% of the amount that the court would normally add to them as a balance - about 120,000 litres.
Each year, 300 successfully made requests are expected.
Andrew Morgan believes that 350 million frees are "work".
“It is an agreement signed by insurance insurance”, says and indicates that the amount is a quarter of what the insurance should be paid if it doesn't take time and people with mezotelion would be able to deal with former employees and normally to blame them.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister for Work and Social Affairs, admitted that the law had "greens".
But Penning and Morgan admit that, due to seven deaths, each year was necessary to negotiate.
"The people suffer too much and help immediately," Penning said in the last year during the second reading of the law concerning mezotelium.
Graham Abbott was in charge of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskio for 19 months.
After the starting consequences, the Lang-Lazdunski operation recommended that it would have a positive effect by Toma Treasur.
After operating, radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed the three-treatment treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski could enjoy a level of overliving five years to 40% of patients.
Abbotta has made it.
"It is of course not the most important thing," says Abbott.
You still see that in patients.
There's something that's hurting you.
When you get out, your status can be very harmful.
Graham Abbott supported the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, the last of six chemotherapy cycles ended.
Controls have not shown any symptoms of disease.
I went to further control in March [2014].
I had a lot of bullets [cakes] in the wheel.
My fifty-year-old birthdays were just near.
It doesn't threaten that life.
Take it.
Abbott rebuild six chemotherapy cycles again.
It's not in his body at the present.
But it's a physical and emotional process.
You need to think of practical things - for financial security, until I die, or to show the woman how the building works on the catch.
If you find bad messages, you will start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After diagnosis, I said the hole, my status means that I'm never old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin's a lot of community and divocation.
She said it to friends, and once we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more sustainable.
She didn't say so much.
All patients with cancer must be discussed with such conversations.
In patients with mezotelium, such conversations are not reflected on the survival or only on the evidence of the possibility of survival.
It brings sickness with her (and finally brings Stephen Jay Gould) incomplete security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "is not a threat to life."
The bodies of Pharaoh's balsamed bodies are covered into the azbest plague.
Azbest flakes are used to make games sure and increase the disorder against the wheel.
Plinius Elder describes asbest.
It was found in the rock that was unhealthed.
I've seen her's made whispers that have been thrown in the woods on the hosts.
In Italy, asbest is beginning to appear in commercial use, it is used for the production of a paper (also the banks) and the tune.
Great Azbest valleys are opened in Canada and South Africa, soon in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it is a wonderful isolation substance in coupled engines and turbines.

During World War II, ships are intensely established, work in ships represents the highest risk of azbest exhibition.
Prohibition of imports of blue azbest
The Court of Auditors confirms the first successful complaint for the consequence of the azbest exposure in Britain.
The world production of azbest increases to more than 4 213 000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Health and Safety Institute requires all azbest suppliers to have licences.
Imports and uses of blue and black asbest are prohibited by the Law in Britain.
In Britain it is prohibited to use all kinds of azbest.
The United Kingdom enters into force the Mezotelium Law.
It's been launched a 350 million compensation programme.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, the white asbest is still used as a league building material.
World production is holding two million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose guidance - demonstrators promise a consequence
The Chinese Parliament, despite multilateral discussions on the Democracy Reform on Sunday, decided not to allow electors in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is probably possible that this step calls for promised protests in Hong Kong's business quarter, because the activists have started to organize and get only a few hours after this notification.
China's human congress, in principle, allows communist leaders to arrange any candidate that is not loyal to Peking.
"We were not surprised, but we were disappointed," said Legal Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's like we've got something to do with the authorization regime.
On the defence of the Chinese decision, the address of the Secretary-General of the National Human Congress of Li Fei National Committee said that to enable public nomination in Hong Kong management options would cause “chaos”.
Since 1997, when British returned to Hungary Government, Peking promises that the population will be able to choose exercising power from 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decisions as a democratic front, since Hong Kong allows direct vote, but also shows that the Chinese leaders hold firmly the Commission's nomination process, which is extremely controlled by Peking.
And according to the new clause, only candidates will be allowed to “love the country and Hong Kong”.
The decision came after the years, which mentioned one of the largest and most followed protests in Hong Kong for several years.
Pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the movement of the Centre of Love and peace, which organizers have threatened by closing the financial quarter if Peking does not make them a general voting right.
On Wednesday, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Okupation's movement in the rain were deceived before the government of Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizations reported that their movement is in the new stage of civil independence and that the protests begin in the next weeks.
However, they did not provide any other details, obviously wanted to avoid the problems of the authority.
In their Internet declaration, the organizations said that the movement “assessed the occupation of the Centre only as the last step in the case of all options of dialogue and no other choice.
We need to notify that today all the options of the Dialogue were clear and the Centre's occupation are unexpected.
The offices in Hong Kong were prepared for the notification of Peking all days and made the protection of the government seat on Sunday and placed police officers and baricades.
Increasing disturbance is, according to many Hong Kong populations, a sign that he loses the city's control quickly.
Agriculture increases competition in products and services.
It also makes sure that the values as democracy and the freedom of words are increased by the pressure of Peking.
Some people criticize the movement of the Centre Occupation and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - the salvation of Hong Kong.
"The protest that he speaks could cause a much more economic damage according to how many people are involved and how it is," says the Political Regina Ip, which moves to criticize at a time.
We don't want to make sure that Hong Kong gets out of control.
Such investment could damage investment.
The Chinese state media also came to reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong have been reported as subversional agents in the west.
In the year of activists, they organized non-official references on voting rights, to which 780 000 voters arrived - more than five elections in Hong Kong.
And in July, ten thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in history.
Previsible agitation?
Liga in Jihlava takes names according to political movement
A small cup plays in the city of Highness approximately 1.600 amateur sports.
And their highest competition is newly called "Community" for Jihlava liga.
The name was obtained according to one movement that goes to the October communal elections.
The tenth of his candidate is also the boss of a little buried in Jihlava Jan Dark.
"It was a wallet, where there was no problem with that," said the Dark.
Situations around the first small bottles have already been involved by lawyers of the Southern Council and recommended to change the division system of touching.
The small bathroom gained the town's town's web around a million crowns.
And it's about the amount in hundreds of thousands of years.
According to the legal opinion, there is no process of small covered in conflict with the law or the Directorate's directives.
However, the situation is for the Office to amend the rules for grants and interventions," said the speaker of the Council of Tulis.
It is likely no longer going to take aside the city's attractive to the town and to put it as a small grave support in the elections of a political side.
A similar request from politics has not yet come to high "great" ball.
That the CSSD should be a national transmission, ODS division or KDU-CHSL 1.
And class and similar competition?
I wouldn't be for.
Instead, I would be aware of if sponsors were turning on us with a series of fires," said the President of the National Balbal Union of Miroslav Vrzáček.
Chief of the small ball of other sides and movement in the name of the body will not leave
According to players of small graves, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six games, shoes and social equipment.
"For example, the cup on Stoups is not our, we're in the ship," he warned Ondry Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlav Club.
The most convenient locality would be the Czech Mountain.
But there, for example, it will be made, according to my opinion, an insensitive area for scatters that are about fifty in Jihlava," he warned the Dark.
Jihlava Jaroslav Wymaszal (ODS) reacted that a small coastal uses a wheel with artificial grass in the streets of Rossica and Na Stoupah, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a wheel that has a maximum use.
We have the modernization or sports exhibition in schools that will be accessible in the afternoon hours.
I think for a little cup made a big progress in the last years," he added.
Another political side in the names of the people does not appear according to Jana Dark.
We have restrictions.
"Nothing will come to us in partnership, so we don't do another anymore," he explained.
"Politic movement in the name of the legend, I think it is at least a disturbing step," said a member of the Officer Commission for Sports Karel Voldán.
"But let the electors appreciate whether Mr. Dark uses along with the small grave of Jihlav and the touching of the city for political assets, or not," added.
American traditions come into university life - the first ones can be a triss aircraft
We're supposed to be able to answer the starting of the first luxual way of service for students in Britain.
After leaving the best income at the university, the company also offers the options of transport of a private tissue or vehicle type Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P.
Stewart also announced that the service has its security page.
The service is the ideal option for students who should otherwise strike their things through the entire state in a dangerously loaded car.
We rejoice that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important element) we will make students this year ensure that the university will come with the minimum nervousness and the maximum luxury.
The speaking company said that because the service was just released, they have no reservations yet, but he added: “The students will start making reservations during the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay a yearly school at 9000 litres, it expects the market service to find their place.
In comparison with students before ten, twenty, thirty or forty years, today's students are other about expectation and desires - is more important than any other time to make the right first idea and the VIF program is exactly the appropriate way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as an unusual.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For the majority of students, such a project is unusual.
Many students who come to the university in this month have to be acquired before thousands of frees of something as simple as to reach the rail, compare with the financial crisis, because available financial aid in the form of money and grants cannot be able to keep steps with the costs of basic needs.
Feminists stand against racism and the behavior of the police after the events in Ferguson
At the beginning of months, he killed a policeman in Ferguson in Missouri.
The present who waits for the grave with the hands up scannes: "Hear up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri for the shoot of an unarmed young man Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoil Perez moved in the Internet discussions of white feminists.
She proved that when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and equality of income, the white feminists predict the race.
With the growing attempt to the Mediterranean, which reached the attention of the total pressure, Perez noted that the reaction of the white was 100% concentrated on the race.
In comparison with the reactions of blackness soon after shooting 9 August, personal articles with the headings as “the concept of white over Ferguson” or “Feminismus” have not only been reported relatively lately.
But according to Perez, it represents a significant change.
"I think there are not much people in the feminist movement who would talk about races and leaders in such a level," she stated.
People felt that what happened had to eat.
For the crisis we face is characteristic, because [situation in Ferguson] is so racially limited that they have to warn about it.
According to the English professor at the State University of Ohiu Korithy Mitchell, Ferguson made a light of the problems that African Americans have to face every day and who are not considered as "femish questions" in the culture.
"I can publish wonderful stories of life on Facebook with my partner and get it 150 people from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the bars are in their own country in the past, it's quietly proud.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about questions, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black ones such as Mitchell, who were concerned about the issue of race, sexuality and sexuality in the American history, there is no interview between the issues of race and the seed of ditomy.
The black ones thought that the Luxus could have been able to divide these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although the white people today co-operate with the question of race and seed in the mainstream femininistic cross, Angela Hattery, professor who is a woman's question and a gender study to George Mason -- says that their pre-governmental work had been reacted.
During 1865 and 1890, at least 10 000 black ones were lined and d' was at least in all cases the violation of the whiteness," Hattery said.
You needed to cooperate with white.
According to Hatter's divorce between white and black, when warfare for electoral rights such as Susan B. Anthony examined at the end of the 19th century the territory and realized that the electoral right could only have one group of people - women or black.
“It was decided to set cards on voting rights for women and the right of blackness to be moved after”, explained Hattery.
When we realize this, we will get an important view of why color women don't believe in white.
We didn't take a good job.
We never helped black people to protect their husbands and children.
Even after women received electoral law in 1920, there were ten years before they began to organize the association of the Sydney women for the prejudice of lynching.
The group arose 40 years after the black girls first told them about help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the issues that have been done in Ferguson - the question of the behavior of police, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists have to "speak" the issues with which the black-countries were addressed by the generation.
"It would not be great if the activists in these Houses [traditional feminism] had the right to educate the child as seriously as they took the right to anticonception?" Mitchell said.
The second feministic wheel, which made a fighting career for reproduction rights and access to anticoncept, now discover what it means.
Significant feministic activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after shooting Michael Browna by Facebook attack, where the column of Rebecca Carrolls from Guardian, which requested the white Americans to protest more prominently against racism.
"I hope that women who have different, but even the concerns for understanding the dangers of the company - and the views of the race that are expressly different in the investigations of public change - will strive to change," said Steinem.
Despite Steinem's intersectional feminism, which includes the issues of race and seed, her comments on the issue of race in America have some people met.
The American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, the author of the book "Who stealed feminism?", said for She The People that young men in the United States, especially young bar of men, are "a much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the comments of Stein Page Ferguson's criticism that she had already called before.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but at least no for boys.
But when the White House started a small My Brother's Keeper program, who had to help the vulnerable young black and his Family, it was called to many feminists, especially Glorie Steinem's disappointed reaction.
The police to the Black Communication is not the only problem that is faced with the mainstream feminism interest.
After the United States Police held this year on Southeast country nearly 63,000 young people without delivery, the issue of the reform of immigration laws, this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercadova, co-president of We Belong Together, a mobilizing women for the reform of immigration laws, said that the question could be submitted as a needed woman, the only thing she had to do was to share the immigrant stories.
"He's talking for himself," says Mercado.
Since the rate of employment authorisations is granted to men, women who come with them are in the position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and disorder.
"These stories have a voice in women's organizations," she said.

After playing in the lottery, Harvey's city is on the south-east of a red millioner.
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
He tries to watch a new millioner in the south-east of Perth, and one happier from the Sabbath lottery seat will take $1,1 million from home.
Traffics in Harvey had been shared in happiness for five years, and in November 2009, one million dollars were decreased.
But the honest exhibitor must just be registered.
The business owner of Steve Forward said he was talking about the town on the south-east of Perth.
It's the main theme, and everyone's a disappointment.
We thought a similar winning was to touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia were divided in the past month, which ended a few happy weeks.
Last week, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five August millions and just a few weeks ago a couple of incredible $7.5 million in Belmont.
The winner's two had a twenty-year-old, and she said that the winning would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The billion of Harvey is 59th lottery soldier in Western Australia for this year, they totally won 85 million dollars.
I'm not going by the Deutsche Bahn walls last night.
Machine drivers want to be higher
GDL in the print statement marked a protest for a warning stage for which he approved the time outside the transport puzzle.
At the selected time of the stage, GDL looks at many people who return from the weekend after the railway to the first working day.
We also think about people who come for work during the day," the committee union introduced on Monday in the print statement for the statement of the stage.
"Our first stage should be attached to the main cost transport, less traveling," GDL added.
DB has not yet published official reactions to the statement of the stage.
There is not even an Arabic way that the protesting action will touch international railway connections, otherwise with the Czech Republic.
The committees require an increase of machine drivers by five per cent and the decrease of work for two hours a week.
The average payment of machinery is currently moved, depending on the processed years between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) annually.
DB machine drivers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to access payment growth when decreasing work.
They also highlight that the raw evaluation of machinery drivers must be developed as in the final rail personnel where DBs do not calculate working weekly decreasing.
It's scared that Christ's car starts burning.
That's why on Barum rallye ended
What exactly happened?
It's been about the management of materials.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like that could happen.
Did the outcome not be temporarily performed and continue in the service at the latest time, where would the mechanisms change it?
When they moved there, yeah.
But we've been waiting for two other erethetics, and it's not enough.
There's a high temperature in it and the risk that the car starts burning was big.
I can't let it.
You made five tests at full time.
What did you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like myself.
We were white, so I didn't go through the guy.
Everything was caused by caring over half a year to be at the same level.
The consequence showed that it was happening to us.
You divorced him so you could actually think of winning.
I prepared myself and my car so that we had the truth.
The job wasn't coming in the morning.
On the other hand, the result we could think was not left.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technology said no.
You weren't the only one of the pigs that had previously declined from the battle of the prime.
They looked out of the breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did you surprise that so many favorites went away?
Yeah.
It was primarily damage for the birds, because the bathroom ended in the past.
It also moved Jaromir Tarabus to which you want the car.
But he's just paying for that he's gone out of the treasure and getting a two-minute manco.
How were you happy with his performance?
It's damage because he could re-speak a degree of winners.
Well, he was in the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was good.
He's got a lot.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of the career, but you got open at the start of Barum raally.
Can you feel a good feeling from the jewel again to make a regular Rally Traveller?
I'm sure not at this moment.
Loni, I said Barumka was my last lead, and I didn't even get it.
I decided I'd go back to her.
It was my nineteenth start now, and when it's going back in a year, I'm gonna go to that.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people have reached a trace only for you.
Did it rejoice you?
In some way, we started just because of them.
In view of people known or unknown, she continued to ask if I'm going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumce?
The team continues.
The next week we'll go to Wyskava, where Robert Adolf's going.
I hope the car hasn't hurt much here.
Moreover, he wants us to pay the Hunza Sykor Fabby.
We're waiting for a European double campaign in Switzerland and Crossland.
That's what we'll have to do next year.
Can you indicate something?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Korsian rallye looked at the world's mystery, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the series.
Doesn't you try a dark trace again?
It's not crazy.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not allowed your doctor to make a confirmation of the work of incapacity that serves as a evidence for the organization that you cannot perform the work of the health care.
Moreover, you haven't just announced the employee.
Even so, even though the present day will be evaluated as allowed, the agreement only passed by mouth.
Although the labour law does not make the obligation to confirm writtenly the consent of the employer with black allowed, this procedure has been certified in practice.
It only comes to a boundary agreement, you don't have a confirmation agreement.
In the case of your case, the depreciation and independence in the work may be considered as an unconscious absence, thus to the immediate distortion of the work at § 53 of the Labour Law.
For the case of a court-contract with the employee, you do not have evidence.
Work with you but has not been canceled in accordance with § 53, you have only the days listed in the accounting list as an uncontracted absency.
The uncontracted absence in the computing list does not have the same results as § 53 (e.g. the failure of collecting weightless safety in unemployment), however, it is difficult to seek a new job.
We recommend you again to visit the given doctor and let you writely confirm that it has occurred in the way you were unable to work (including "incapacity", it is only the doctor's document).
When searching for a new job, you can present and explain the documentation.
In practice, it is appropriate to notify how to make a written medical confirmation on the work of incapacity, so quickly notifying the employer or requesting a written consensus with clearly allowed.
You're surprising such complications.
Tony Stewart's accident when returning to trace
The return on the trail ended for Tony Stewart just a half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway trails.
Stewart's subsequently entering the throat after his right front pneumatic in 172, and the driving for it ended.
Stewart brought a devastated car to the garage, he didn't get out to the reporters and left.
Chad Johnston's team boss said that the car team 14 is disappointed, but now he's going to focus on Richmond, Virginia, the next weekend.
"I would like, and they had better performance and better conclusion," Johnston said.
Let's go to Richmond and hope we'll get more there.
Stewart first entered the breakfast on Sunday dinner dinner after Kyle Busche, which requested the right side of his car.
"We've put on a good deal today," Johnston added, "It just didn't come out."
Soon after the second havary, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to go.
After his car shot and killed another driver in New York, Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup districts.
He decided to return this weekend, and he needed to win either the leadership in Atlantic or the next leadership in Richmond to get the place in the table.
He returned in the investigation of the tragic accident, in which Kevin Ward Jr. died twenty-years, who took Stewart during the travel.
The authorities said that investigation of the cause of accident would take at least two weeks.
It hasn't been decided whether Stewart would be committed to such accusations.
Three-personal champion was expected to be an encouraging.
Stewart started at the 12th place, at the beginning of the bathroom, worked at 10th, and then even at 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122th car, Busch's car number.
18 got out of control, went out of the second shot and arrived to Stewart, which both of the vehicles were sent to the shopping.
Stewart continued, but he became 21 places.

And it wasn't a person who was professionally done, the grandfather put her out his help.
A long time.
She's just been on three boxes, and it's totally awesome, as I'm saying, all was on the car, but as I say.
The water was great.
By the airport.
When we got the rubber, we're sure we've got water out.
When she was there a few months, she deserved it.
But then we seemed that the water wasn't worn.
We were attacked if something didn't fall there.
In the place where the past was thrown, it was possible for a few smiles, the rain couldn't be stuck there, so the opening was a comfortable kiss of the tissue.
Our inspections confirmed that the cigarettes moved.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we lighted it down to the bottom.
So we left her and cleaned her again.
Of course, we improved the improvized tissue around the crap.
We've noticed strange things in the store.
On the ground, there was a beautiful packaging with a cut.
So, at least it seemed.
And the cup's next.
Now it looked like a shit mouse.
At the street, in the places where the lands are, the grandfather's finding, there were the rest of the fish!
And he's hard to go!
Our deal is also suitable.
Someone would say that the grandfather was shortly undergoing the chat.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only a shaded song, only the stream is broken.
There's a ship mainly.
And the car.
And the bed on the beach.
The gate with the wide seas was openly opened as someone walked there in one cushion.
A few already mentioned aircrafts in the street.
Without a network, so the birds are running out there and put the neck on the trames.
The mouse is unusual to remember.
Grandma wanted to fight it, and that's it again.
Now, the air hasn't helped.
The whole closure was covered.
So we cleaned the whole party.
Especially the fish on the tram was survival!
We also cut off the things that were around: the bridge, the heraklit board, and so.
Our chat remotely welcomed the deinfective odier.
We're thinking about who could get the nice rests there?
The nearest cat lives two miles from here in all.
It's hard to get to us.
Grandmother attacked a neighbor who's not all right.
If he didn't shoot the Franta's insults there?
There's practices all the year, stupid ideas, that's him.
We decided to guard and regularly control the decision.
After a few days, everything was okay.
We started using the water again, but only on the motion and the motion before the tests are ready, but it was good.
Take water from the boss school is nothing I want to do.
One time, we heard the horrible relief of our pheny.
Mom looked out of the Ballon and saw it in the grass near Verandy with a strong black cow.
She's got a row over her, and she's stuck like a fool.
Mom's got her out because she thought Reza was winning a waste from the cockpit.
At once, however, it was partly cut into the club and partially joined it.
The ballon was thrown.
Reza got histerical inhibition.
We moved down.
The bullet, long over a metro and dark like a bullet, wanted to cut a big hair, and Reza defended her in it.
It wasn't worried if she wanted to save the cup or if she wanted to burn it alone, but it was inappropriate.
When she saw the passport in the form of the whole family, she probably told us that we would burn it when we were so hungry, and she was elegantly walking through the door to the store.
We were flying after her.
It's like a black shot for the cow.
Only that way, we mentioned her chairs another bullet packet.
It's like a fish.
She wasn't there!
Our new security around the floor was a little shidry.
And that's what we've locked on a day.
That would...
We went out and everyone went out there to one air.
We didn't expect.
It's been crazy for the football.
Earlier, the table of the head with the yellow moon on the roof.
Then the whole cup is cut off on the cockpit.
She went around and started getting inside.
The acquired employee was moving, buying a notebook firm and selling them
The dead employer purchased the computer company after the release and then sold them.
The money got to lose before the police was arrested.
During a short time, the husband bought in 12 cases in total sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"Notebooks after the transfer of Olomouca, where he sold them after the basarch," said the top Commissioner of the Shummer Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of subways was the employee to leave and also to gain money.
"When he listened, he claimed that he used money for credit payments," Brückner said.
Police also proved that the subwayer was a pathological player who was retreated on psychiatries.
Thus, money could also be completed in excellent devices or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we didn't find any money," said Commissioner.
The underwater, who was sentenced once for the claim, is now threatened to stay in the service for a year to five years.
Policies have not yet done whether the penalty is threatened to the bases that the notebooks bought under the price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they have collected completely new goods, which is minimally suspicious," said the Commissioner.
Nevertheless, no of the baser owners has yet been accused.
Come on, you'll be able to do that or how I used We's Prague.
The computers have prepared a few changes for us for years.
The biggest change was the change of the road that brought the target on the floor, instead of bringing back to the Gulden Lakes.
I was pleased with the rest of the team, but I got him to live so little on the other side.
We and the whole team decided personally to cure our readers at the station where we were together and put the video.
To get my view of the other side to perfect, I accepted the role of the personal leader.
Along with the friend Cathy, we have been ordered to the end of the core 60 to 70 minutes before we started.
We welcomed friends who went around us to the `Fires' sector.
It wasn't a lot of time.
A couple of speeds on dilution, switch sport tests, calculation and start!
Crystals of jasoto, but instead of the start of the beginning followed the couching to the start of the line.
After five minutes, we're coming to the door, we're switching the motion, and we're breaking the template at ten hours.
We prompt with the yellow hair of runers, who are like Cata's first running.
In fact, everyone looks fresh, quickly swimming sun on the cloud adds a look on the highest garden almost to the kidneys.
It looks like the whole Prague was running here.
At the borders between the East Garden and the National Division, traditionally begins to be shown who has power.
Easy cup on the Palack Place makes a lot of running away or go to the coat.
Just before I go to Divadel, I see the police leading and immediately after him the Victory of Paul's incredible temper to the goal.
I'm listening to the wonderful fucking respiration of the final runers.
I'm moved to the surface of the treasure, I encourage him, and he's going to weep with me, but just before it, my feet will be cut off and our hands slow down.
See the Divadel Street gives a chance for a short rest and breathing.
It's needed, before us, there are places on which my visions will breathe.
The island on the Monte of Manesh shows Prague in all the beautiful west sun.
I don't breathe and my feet get me almost alone.
It's a moment of truth for the first farmer.
On the road, the Cathe's screaming on the road and leading the spring of the floor.
I see if she doesn't help, and I'm going to break a series of encouraged words so that she couldn't have time to think of pain.
It comes up and we continue on the street of Koz, it's one of the most useful places of trait, in this stage of conviction, although there's no longer such a battle, but it's necessary to look well on the surroundings.
I don't know that the most useful place is to get the real importance of the poetry.
The frenetics are encouraged by the Tourists and the friends of the rest of the running.
I'm trying to swim up with everyone who offers a hand, and I do it to Kata, because ten tissues with a fanus is like a half of the energy fuck.
It's working, we're looking again, and if we're very clearly missing, now it's started a thick driving.
We offer decades of refugees when I have someone especially stumbled, I'm trying to encourage him to say, "Come, come on, you'll be able!"
There's no one who's going to overcome us, we'll see.
So long as we run for a hour and a quarter, we add, there's nothing to wait.
Three miles in the goal will be pained, but it's necessary to swim.
The sun has soon fallen, and the end of the symbolic day is quietly completed.
The last outcome to the pool, the island and just the equation to the goal.
The time we're running is hurting me where the girl's going on?
"Come, let's go under a thirty-hour, let's go!" I'm calling.
We're trying to print it, and it's a goal here.
Three and six seconds.
Well, what's going to do.
The trainer set the limit for twenty hours.
So seven minutes under the plan.
That's a great outcome.
Just for the purpose of Cata's foot, I'm helping them to get a little fun of her rest.
It's on her to see the excitement, but also the happiness of the good conduct.
After a moment, I'll take her quickly out of the goal room.
Euphoria doesn't think about pressure in the past to weaknesses.
Here's seeing the Cozy Street wasn't the most useful place.
It's here for the purpose of a shopping, which is at least ten thousand fugitives pressed to be stuck.
If anyone doesn't have davy, it's not a place for.
I'm also losing my head and thinking if these wonderful views and spending the past years the way was more interesting than what's going on in the goal.
From my own experience, I know that the order of a divorce isn't any pleasure.
It adds ten thousand people, the rich delivery programme and the closing of the whole Centre of Prague for all transport, it is a great challenge.
The annual road change showed to the runers a lot of interesting places, which also brought a number of facts of unfair surprises.
The electoral atmosphere in the Yellow Medicines has been transferred between running and in a single divorce.
Organizators around the trail and the accidental whispers graduated it at each meter of the tree.
In the town's history center, despite all, it must be counted with an interruption that can't be removed, but the goal of the mass divorce in the place that is on the one side of the wall and the other river, I don't think the best solution.
I'm not gonna say that the commitment has ended with the goal, I'll appreciate it as very important.
For my purpose, I had a little fear of the health of those involved, but, finally, it was good.
Write us to the debate if you liked the road and what you say in the goal.
Prisonal supervisors in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of employees in the whole Bulgaria have been meeting a international protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the main city of Sofia.
At peaceful demonstration, they repeated their request for re-recommendation of workshops that have recently changed.
On the list of requests to be negotiated with the provisional Minister for Justice Christo Ivanove, there are even higher payments.
The supervisors protested against the new work at the time and requested to return to the twenty-four-year changes.
Although the Committees of Foreign Supervisors and Representatives of the Ministry of Justice were met, not agreed, the Bulgarian State (BNR) was informed.
"The Court continues to proceed," said the BNR, leader of the General Directorate of the Royal Service of Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of the Committee Organizations of Employment to the Ministry of Inner Ministry are also joined to the protests of employees.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
The physical habit of bestsellery does not write, but Brian Green from the Colombian University was put to black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has been the most accessible way for a period of time, how to reach the holiday problems that today have a number of theoretical physicals - can be able to unit two greatly functioning, but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantitative theory and general relativeity.
One of the reasons for success of the Elegant Universe is that in the case of seeking a united physical theory is not a needy story.
The physical basic problem between two key theories (for at this moment our universe is de factly divided into two worlds with different laws) has been resolved and thus decided that it is worth preliminary and lakes.
Greene also advised the complex material so fresh and exclusively that he could not calculate how much interesting he had not included in his book.
Moreover, his "fout" of the most important part was in the two other books: the structural of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Obviously, the author would not ask anything against whether his book was an older, but the fact is that, after 15 years, the Elegant University still provides all the basic things that would have been informed with ambition to understand the world about this important part of the theoretical physics.
It is extremely likely that in the next years there will only be something living in this Area (this is because the LHC-making finally goes to "full gas"), and so a good moment is to enter Green unfairly opened doors of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three space dimensions, it can certainly sound sharks, fantastics, wonderful or mysticks.
Yet, it's particular and totally acceptable.
And they understand it, let's turn our eyes from the universe for a moment as a whole to something farther, specifically to a long and heavy garden shadow.
Imagine that a stometer garden shadow you take from one side of the canyon to the second and follow the whole scenario from a half-mile meter distance (as on the image and on the next page).
From that distance, you easily mention the rubber in the horizontal direction, but if you just don't suffer by a bistroscale, you're different from the throat.
In view of your great distance from the hair, you would think that the martyr of a devoted living on the hair has only one dimension in which it can be pronounced: the left-right dimension has shared the shadow.
When someone asks you where the morning was at a given moment, answer him only with one data: the distance of the movingness from the left (or the right) end of the hair.
This is what we want to say just that from half milk remote seems to be a long cow of the square as a single-dimensional object.
He's got a cockpit in the true world.
Increasingly, we watch the second dimension -- in the face of the circle of the olive hair.
In such an increased view, it is evident that the marble can be moved in two independent dimensions: in a well known left-right dimension after the length of the hair, but also in a "constraint to the direction of the movement of the hour hands", so around the cross-border.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small m'engine, you have to specify two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hair and where it is on the circuit of the olive hair.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hair is bilateral (e.g. experts will notice that this is focused clearly on the strun theory.
Unusual aspects are included in 12 and 13.).
The opposite of the hair is double-different: one long middle size is shown directly by a wheel, the dimension in the direction of the circle, indicated by the circle, is short and swimming.
However, between these two dimensions is a division.
The size of the shadow is long and easily visible.
The size of the olive cover is short, "swift" and heavyly significant.
And the existence of the circles have realized that we had to examine the hairs with an extremely better solution.
This example illustrates the important property of space dimensions.
That they're dividing into two groups.
They may be big, brilliant, and therefore directly obvious, or small, swimming, and very harderly observed.
Of course, in that case, we haven't just seen, and we have discovered the "svinuto" dimension of the ovinous ovinous cup.
You've got enough to take a remote view help.
But if the hair was thick - like the hair or the capillar, they were only discovered with a great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent its article to Einstein, in which he was struggling with a huge idea that the space geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for us all.
Its radical statement of Kaluza rejected by providing additional dimensions a elegant and convinced one, in which Einstein’s general relativeity and Maxwel’s electromagnetic theory can be vested into the only, united concept structure.
The question is immediately questioned how this Kaluz's view of the inheritance with evidence that we see just three dimensions of the space.
The answer that Kaluza was quietly suggested between the lines and which he expressed and exposed the Swedish Math of Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the statement that the space geometry of our universe can have both large and swimming dimensions.
This means that, as the dimension in the direction of the width, our universe has a big, light and visible three dimensions, which we know each moment.
But the analogue with the circle area of the garden coast can have the universe and the additional dimensions, solidly cut into the room so imminent that they have remained afterwards before our most perfect experimental machines.
And they got a clearer idea of the foundation of Kaluz's attention, let's remain châu at the hair.
Imagine that we draw a black color with a relatively dust range of circles.
He's still looking like a tiny one-dimensional line.
With a remote view now, thanks to the drawing, we'll discover the snow size still, we'll see the same motive from the image 2.
Obviously, we see that the surface of the hair is double-different, with one large and at least unlimited and with the second short and circle.
Caluza and Klein came with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circle dimension has three large space dimensions, so doromades four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw object with too many dimensions.
And -- their imaginations have helped a little, let's note the illustration of the obr.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circle size.
On the image, we increase the view of the room geometry as we increased the surface of the axes.
Each next level represents a significant increase in space geometries from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of increase), if they are cut into the enough small space; so we explain that we have not seen them right now.
The fourth network illustrates the currently known "ground" dimension, while the circle is a new, small and swimming dimension.
Just as the swimming swimming in the swimming copper, and these circles exist in every place of circumcised dimensions - we just have drawn them in the square network because of the view.
The background of the image 4 illustrates the currently known Space structure - a usual world around us - in running measurements such as meters, focused on the side of the small quarter in the quarter network.
On each next image, we move on a small picture of the pre-filled; we increase it to become visible.
At the beginning, nothing is special, as we see some of the first levels of increases.
However, when we proceed on our way to the microscopic properties of the room next, at the fourth level of enlargement in the image 3 - we see the new, in the face of the circle with a swimming dimension, like the smileys in the dust of a white copper.
Caluza and Klein came with the idea that the additional circle dimension exists at every place in the direction of large dimensions as well as the loops of the circle round at each point of its length.
In the interests of the view, we have set the circle dimension only in some, regularly aligned points.
Image 4 of Kaluzo and Klein's representation of the microscopic geometry structure of the room.
Similarity with adequate is obvious, perhaps we mention important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-displaying space dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), where the hair has a large dimension only one.
More important is that we are now talking about the space geometry of the universe alone, not only about the subject inside the universe, perhaps our shadow.
The basic idea is the same.
The additional circle is extremely miniature dimension, spread it - the same as the circle coverage - much harder than watching apparent, large and transparent dimensions.
If the additional size is sufficiently small, it will be discovered in the ability and over the power of our most potential tools to enhance.
The most important, however, is that the additional dimension is not only the oblique in the running dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration is falsely indicating.
The cross dimension is a new dimension that exists in each point of three different dimensions.
It is the dimension of the three decreased dimensions independently as the sizes of the shora-dolls, left-right and forward-to-back independent (and round) each other.
Small m'engineck could be moved in all four dimensions and to determine its position, four data needed, besides three clothing positions still in the circle dimension; if we also count the time, then five data, in any case more than one normally expected.
Did you sound?
Book Elegant University Brian Greeen you can buy here on books.idnes.cz.
The price for the e-book is 149, Tch.
To our surprise, then, we find out that if we are only three dimensions of the Space, Kaluzov and Klein's opinion shows that there are no additional cutting dimensions, if they are sufficiently small.
The universe can have quietly more dimensions than how much we can see them with the only eye.
How small should it be?
The most powerful technical equipment can divide the structure of a large billion billion meters.
We can watch the smaller wheat size.
In 1926, the idea of the Klein p's Kalus's idea was combined with some of the thoughts of the relative quantity mechanisms.
His calculations indicated that additional circle dimensions could have a size of approximately one Planck's length, so the size is far away from the skills of today’s devices.
Since that time, the physics calls the possibility of additional additional space dimensions of Kaluzo-Clein theory.
Wohing Honza Homola advises how to wear on electric hydrogen: 5 part
The whole base of "double" consists in a 12-take harmonised form that you can liberally repeat.
Whoever goes into music theory, finds her principle detailedly explained here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By building a lottery and loutchool, whose facebook profile can be seen here, they live as a graphic from maturity twenty years ago.
It's the kytarist of the Wohne's capelle, which, desirablely, doesn't get away from.
Kytaristou is after his father, like Brother Matthias, leader of Wohnets.
With training, start on one street.
"Rythmical model is only for you, you can imagine anything, then it's enough to apply it to the harmonised model of twelve," Honza advises.
If you add another stream, you can change the figure again.
It's enough to listen to and follow Honza, which is done with the twelve harmonisation of two streams to think and how nicely it starts to sound.
If you prepare a third stream, you can coke with melodia equal songs.
When you finally add the fourth, attention to the change of shipment, Honza warns in the video.
The next day, Honza will return to the pentatonic and you'll try to give her to the dozens just with a twelve.
So get her honestly.
As best, read it in conversation with Jane Homolo at the first lesson of his school game on the electric kytar here.
Other without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, he recognises the Garden County.
We're taking the point and we're on.
We had more chances to us, the second house," said the attacker, who was cut this time out of the rock.
Didn't you have been nervous when he was taking him, but he just got her a bitter sand?
I haven't done it especially, even though on the second place where home fans are, it's probably worse.
You've made the penalty after half, but you also got from the penalty after four minutes.
What happened?
We slept at the beginning, we were pass, we got up from that corner and then after it.
After her, you went up and first half time you were the best team that had more chances.
Why did that change after the stop?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we've played after incased, until we've stopped.
We said in the cabine we wanted to keep the game time after it, but we couldn't.
To say the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is also true that households have said something to their games, and they haven't had too much satisfaction with her.
You've just been first in the chain, while you're not yet getting home.
Why is that a lot like that?
I wouldn't say it's such a section, but it's more important to us how we're going to do that.
We started well, but then it was bad from us, Plutney, that's another category.
Four of you've been waiting for →, didn't you fear that after the past hit, it could be similar?
It's not even, but we're understandingly true that we don't have to listen to the words of waiting for the past.
Now we have been added to another, but there are only three in six, which is not yet a great celebration.
Iceland - the law is coming from kilometers from the remote corner.
The leaf flying to the surface of Holuhraun near the Vatnayekull liver, reaches the underground tunnel from kilometers of the distance corner.
It is located under the ice, the same part of the mentioned underground leaf tunnel.
This power now is worried most...
The situation remains unchanged.
From yesterday (31.8.)
2014) It still flys out of the puclin about the same amount of lava.
However, in contrast to the ply-approvals, its quantity is lower than 1000 m3, but "one" 300-400 m3.
In front of the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x.
However, scientists are afraid that the leaf tunnel could be opened in places where it is under iron.
It would also happen, in addition to the similar intensity, which leads the current eruption, it would mean a huge floor, as in the River Jökulsá a Fühlum, so on the other rivers.
In the area of the eruption, it is to feel strong grapes of grass, from the markets stood the clouds of pairs and gases.
It was decided that the eruption was not suitable for tourism movement, as it was in the case of the eruption in Fimm Warduhals in 2010.
This is much more and there is also much more gases," says vulcanolog Armann Höskuldsson.
However, time from yesterday has been significantly improved, and in ransom hours, it was almost unbelievable.
The songs of the rain were smiling with the rain.
Scientists can continue to work.
For a flying operation, the oransual stage (two highest) is paid for the Boarddhungung and the yellow (third) for Askju.
The sky over Chebe was a courageous Lady Peggy.
She's gone through the woods
A flying day in Chebu.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine, Peggy Valentin's aircraft was represented, which went out of the cockpit for a year from the top of a double-scale and between the sticks.
There's only been rejected for the power of the swallows.
A flying day in Chebu has been able to be prepared for a number of interesting aircrafts for years.
The Premier at the oldest Czech Airport was not only "cooking after chairs" in the administration of the German acrobatics Peggy Valentin, but also legendary stick P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft Airport 18.
The guy took attention to himself with his severe throat.
Acrobate named Wingwalking has p' in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots were so trying to make.
But because of a large number of deaths, it was prohibited.
But today he's quickly returning to the plane of flying days.
Peggy's going out of the cockpit to the top wheel.
There's different practices.
At the end of the outcome, he moves to the space between the aircraft wheels, where its show continues," described Ludek Matejicz from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the aircraft organizer.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's exhibition was the main cup of the program, then the next representation of Mustang's stick was a famous trigger in the garden.
The Legendary Shooter arrived on the desktop with the Grippene Army of the Czech Republic in the conveying (tax to numbers).
The flight fans in Czech could see the first one.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavski then preached to everyone the breast acrobacy with the airport of 1945.
He was still made for war, but he probably never participated in her.
He was locked in military reserves.
Since 1963, he acted in a civil campaign.
And as a travel airport.
Today, he has his householding hangar on the airport in Mnich Croatia.
In the same place, there is also another cheb aircraft perla, a double-motor Beechcraft C45H Expert.
The airport wasn't going to see the powerful machine.
His throat thrown down the street.
He also gained a machine Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in French aircraft colors.
Small transport aircraft surprised the rejected Turbolet and from German Hofu led part of the German delegation to the airport day.
German neighbors in Chebu have been transferred with reconstructed aircrafts like 18T or a triple form of Bücker Jungmann doublers.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return before the camera!
The parents' concerns changed Lucie Borhy at least for this evening for the work.
Stress or nervousty - the blonde modernator doesn't know anything of that.
The modernization of television messages was good, as if she didn't stop with him for two months!
It's just two weeks that the blondin has ended the sixty-year-old worker, where women enjoy the greatest stress after birth.
However, Lucie is still regularly shown in the main reporting session TV Nova.
The regular return is waiting for it according to the Blesk.cz information for a month.
But only her daughter Linda now is more than a TV girl.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen, and it was a tree in black.
Exhibitions for a year in Prague?
Hala would sold, planned Jagr's divorce.
It would be worthwhile if something like that had been done during the world's mastership.
But it depends on how the connection will be made," he said in Jihlava after exhibition with the name of Golden Refugee, in which a wonderful Nagan team has rejoiced.
And players who shared in the golden hatrick.
The players would like to, huh?
Sure.
It would be quickly good to make discovery with the golden generation during mystery.
I think they're going to find one two days during the tours when it's free and where such an injury could be mixed.
We'll say that to Gum (Jirum Szlégrovi) or to Bédhi Scherban (Agency of the Yulov's ship), who would take it to worry...
Aréna would be sold.
But what if you're playing with New Jersey play-off?
So when I'm coming so...
You don't want to play in a representation.
Or have the Southern meeting changed your decision?
Repreparation and exhibition are two different things, and in representation are decision-making performances.
One thing is that people would see me there, but the accomplishments are determining, especially for the mistership of the world.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you actually use this Nagan search?
It was just a great meeting with the player.
The man survived his stories and lived a lot of pleasure.
It was a great result not only for the fans, but also for our hokejiths.
The most important was Ivan Hlink's appetite.
And it's good to put the story of our hokey, and that one generation is going out that really stands.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimir Rhodica and Peter Czechmanek.
You're still gonna save your first representative storage?
It doesn't care about such things.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: I, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we were in one three.
For all this was the first representative start.
But they were dominated in a way, so it can't be said.
In Jihlava, he took Dominik Hashek for a long time.
What did you say about his accomplishment?
Hashan never surprises me on the ice.
I wanted to return to him with that critic, but I can't (Hashek criticized Jagra for d'you, why he decided to end in the representation).He just asked excellently.
He's also been a great man.
Then he was driving with me once in the night, and he was there.
And now he's got to be able.
First of the United States and then from the Netherlands, the Balalistes starts .
To the Michovic NH Hotel, the next morning, the prominent hosts were sitting in the middle of the NH Hotel.
People were able to defeat the needs of Peter Chech from Chelsea, the representative trainer of Paul Vrbu...
And there, this place in the black bottle, that's Tomás Rossic!
The leader of Arsenal and the representative arrived around half the twelveth of the last.
We're waiting for a beautiful fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be pleased?" said when he had already been in the representative construction before the journalist.
Czech Representative Programme
Monday 1 September: beginning of confusion, first train
Wednesday 2 September: Trénink open for fans (18:30, Year) Autogramiada (20:00)
Middle 3 September Czechland - USA (20:15, Year)
Wednesday 9 September - Netherlands (20:45, Year) end of the meeting
The Russian and the family can support fans even before the centership against the United States (20:15).
The reprelucation also opened an outer train that starts at the Years at 18:30.
And he's gonna follow the autography on which Russian or Czech miss.
Otherwise, this conflict of the national team will be more calm.
What praises the trainer Vrba, who just moved to a number of community action on the jail.
Finally, we're going to do what we want to do.
Now we'll focus on Netherlands.
It's good when you have players in the eight days.
We'll have time to deal with things that haven't been so much time," he praised the Vrba, which officially leads from January.
The Czech Baltic Representation will be conducted in the new cycle of the Musketyrian image when it comes into the new cycle.
The repressure has three backs, all ready.
With Norway and Finland, 2, and with Rakousk was born 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's right now.
The attack with the Netherlands is also aborted by the process of the mistership of Europe 2016.
Czech mastership would, of course, help if it had been a general against the United States.
The half-hour was, and they met.
Now there are important results.
We have to think about it, and they were successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player of thirty-five nomination, which has health problems, is the attacker David Lafat.
He's suffering the temperature.
If he wouldn't be able to heal to the center of the United States, the trainer Vrba would call another attacker.
Genetic infections are often malicious
A British woman describes how she thought she would die after a bad diagnose for many years.
After she had been infected with another disease, Karin Rodgers had been able to make up adults in the opinion that she remained just a few years of life.
It was the Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of herds that damage nerves outside the brain and the patrol.
The charitable CMT UK organization noted that the bad diagnosis is a timely problem between people with CMT, because they only know very little about illness.
It is because CMT suffers about 23,000 people in the United Kingdom, which can be shown symptoms in motors such as swallow weakness, inevitable behaviour and rounded fingers on the feet.
In the effects, there may also be an incidence or pain, this condition is untreated and progressive, which means that symptoms are deteriorated during the period of time.
When Rodgers was the thirteenth, she thought she suffered Freedreich's attaxis (FA) - illnesses that had a very bad predict.
She believed that before she celebrated the eighteenth birthday, she would be cut off on the rock's chair, and she was dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children now 51 says: “As a child, I felt that I couldn’t do the same things as the last.
I fell every day, and everything took me longer.
I've never been able to drive with the last kids on the cocktails or on the scateboard, and I've been shocked at school because of how I walked and run."
When Rodgers was the thirty-year, and after some operations, which had to release her Achil's shoes and equipped the walk, she used her doctor to go out of the room and watched her documentation where she learned that she was suffering FA.
"I felt surprised because I followed, and so I didn't tell anyone, but when I returned home, I looked for information about illness in the book and wrote to Association FA," he says.
When they answered me, I was in shock, I was totally paniced.
I thought before my eighth, I'll finish the car, and before it's fifty, I'll be dead, and I'll lose all my ability.
I was completely alone, and I planned my funeral."
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability was not so harmful as she assumed and asked her chirurgical.
He just stood up, took her and said: “Look, I don’t think you have a sickness here, else you would have been on a car.
I think it'll be a lot less dangerous life."
After some genetic tests were performed, it had CMT.
"When he explained what CMT is, I thought I was a happy child," she said.
The charitable CMT UK organization started a month of information on CMT to warn this disease.
Business employees in Washington: with economic turnover taxes
The growth economy means more clients, higher sales and new jobs.
And the higher tax also.
According to the new investigation that was published last week, the state and local transmission of fires in the country with the sanction of economic health last year has grown quitely and the companies in Washington have not been exceptional.
Companies in Maryland and Virginia for the financial year 2013 were transferred to State and local payments 27.6 billion dollars, which is 3.8 % higher than 26.6 billion dollars selected in 2012.
Tax charge - State and local - last year, 4,3 per cent of $671 billion was compared to 3,9 per cent of the last year and was the third year of growth after 2009 and 2010 when taxes were reduced.
According to the study conducted by the professional company Ernst & Young and the political collection of the Centre on State Taxation, the State taxes increased by 4,3 % before local divisions, with 3,9 %.
More than half of the tax income in the circuit, 56 %, is from the animal tax, and 36 % of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows the relatively smallest tax income from the business.
The investigators claim that the amount of tax income increases the value of the inability of enterprises, which increased by the imposability of this year following three years of growth by -1 %.
Although the most profits come from large countries like California, New York and Texas, it seems to be the same in Washington.
Communities in D.C., Maryland and Vrigini last year paid over 10 billion dollars for State and local taxes of invalidity, which represents an annual growth of 4,2 %, compared to 9,6 billion in 2012.
However, the evidence of the ability value is not so exhausting the state and local tax in Maryland, where the tax of freedom represents a non-complete fifth delivery of the company.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., it represents a tax of the failure to be a half of the state and local tradition.
“In Maryland a lot of fire ability, especially the basis for tax in the D.C., a government or an unfair organisation which does not pay tax,” explained Douglas Lindholm, the Executive Director Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is needed much more, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax income from the company cannot be added only to the healthy market with the failure.
According to the data, the income from the business also appears to be increased.
The companies in this region published a tax from the revenue of business companies of 2,3 billion dollars, which increased from 2,1 billion from 2012.
Maryland has chosen one billion dollars in the region on the income of business companies.
Although they are assembled in the same direction, local tax charges of businesses do not grow in these three places equally.
The growth measure in D.C. was at the total average level of 4,3 %, while the growth of Maryland was significantly higher, 4,9 %.
Only in Virginia was an increase in the medium, to 4,1 %.
Virginia has the lowest delivery of enterprises from all three areas (including all the same terms), 6 %.
The measure of trade companies in Maryland is 8.25 %, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975 %.
Similar study that the American trade room has been conducted this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local translation and totally more profitable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study was unexpected.
Despite this advantage, Virginia holds the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed the law that reduces trade tax from 6,9 % to 6 %, as well as Virginia, and the next year the tax is reduced to 5 %.
In the following year, the income objectives would be continued to be fulfilled, and the income rates could be reduced to 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study with the major employees in Washington, it makes it better, and therefore pays higher state and local taxes.
Live-standing tax taken by detailed enterprises as a tax from personal receipts - the compensation structure for increased prices by the increase of prices - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia has increased 20 % in 2,4 billion dollars last year, much more than other taxes.
The researchers claim that the trend and national increase in animal tax will probably continue the next year, the total tax income from the sales for State and local governments shall be increased by 6,2 % in comparison with the same period in the last three first quarter of 2014.
However, Washington can stay for the end because the reduction of State expenditure is to choose its tax on the labour market.

Family Joan Rivers: "We keep our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been inconsciently three days since they brought her to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter today has said that she doesn't work that a 11-year-old comic will be healed.
"We thank you for your welcome and support," Melissa Rivers said in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a phone at a safe service, which was found in her heart-conditioning at the Yorkville Endoscopy in Upper East Side, as he introduced the source.
Medicinal doctors maintain it in the meantime under the effect of sedative and in a close supervision until they make sure that it remains “severe”.
Reactions have not been allowed to wait and it is probably uncomfortable support on the Internet from personality such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is crossed titles
That media cross the reality with their titles, there is no news.
I know the titles "sell" of the newspapers, but, desirable, I also know that many such "readers" are not reading anything else.
And that's the fact that I'm very troubled last time, it's more exciting than the word of the snow.
This is, in particular, the articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in Gaza's story.
The titles "Israel attacked Gaza."
First in the text you read that the Israelian "revolution" was a reaction to the exposed rackets from Gazy's rackets, which are many times in the time of the announced approach.
Then the title "The two sides have distorted the advantage."
Does the newspapers realize that this process is directly shared in antisemit positions that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there?)?
Not even sixty years since the end of World War II.
People who have survived Shaw now.
When I saw videos from the German Federal Republic, where he gave the password "Jewish swine" and similar confidence, I was arrested.
That's what the world wants to end what Hitler didn't say?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews, they were intended to eliminate Slovenians?
Ladies and gentlemen of journalists, please take a little more care of your job.
You are often marked as "seeing dogs of democracy".
So get her.
As long as he's here.
And deal with the right of the only democracy state in the Near East to protect your population.
How would you like to keep our government, if some of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation was deceived and the Czech Republic would remove from the world map?
Maybe you should also know another fact.
There are nearly 20% of the Arabs with Israel's citizens in the territory of Israel.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they don't get between "they" or to Gaza, they'll answer you why they would do it?
In Israel, I have work, social security and health care (I have only seen to my own eyes as in the Spanish private disease of Hadass, financed by the sponsoral gifts of Jews from the world, running away, and the Arabs are clearly treated there).
Hamas will also attack his Arab brothers with his shoes.
The only real help of Gaze, and this insult, is to save Hamas and arm him.
And do not judge Israel, and be unrighteous in the titles.
Inform about Hamas practices, about his disuse of people as human shirts.
Inform that Hamas is intended to defeat Israel's state, for any price.
Even for the price of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Inform that in nine years of self-administration in Gaza, this could be a wonderful thanks to humanitarian assistance from the world.
Even from Israel, which adds water and electricity for which Gaza manager does not pay and even claims that sometimes they are interrupted in this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the exhibition of underground tunnels so that they could overcome self - killing attackers in Israel’s territory, but to build homes, sicknesses and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better.
Amazon buys for $1,04 billion Twi
AMAZON just confirmed the statement Information from Monday: Internet negotiator - video manufacturer and hundreds of other things - buying for $1.04 billion (970 million American dollars) video streaming service Twi.
The announcement was a surprise because no one would expect you to buy someone, but because it was expected to be YouTube buyer.
Three months ago, Twitche Googl seemed to be a billion safe, and this connection looked natural.
Three years ago Justin.tv had to be endeavored to become a generally used video streaming service - a living YouTube version.
Instead, it became a platform for players who sent online transfers from her - words Business Insider “YouTube for Live Transfer Games”.
Interface Twitche.
On YouTube are already an annual video "Let's play", the kind where the artrants (the majority of elders) provide the processing games of Mystery Science Theater.
It is that YouTube comes to a lot of overseer, so the reports that YouTube buys Youwi; no one has rejected, was a discernment example of how the entertainment is paying my competition.
It is a reason why the YouTube agreement did not come out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Everything we have now available is the CEO Twitche Emmet Sheara: "We have chosen Amazona, because he is in our company, he has the same values and a time of view and wants to help us fulfill it."
Another mystery is - sincerely - incredible success of Twitche.
For snows like me, who claims that sports are better doing than watching, it is hard to understand what is so careful about it, games playing place only to watch.
One thing is looking at three friends through the ram, playing Resident Evil, and the other thing is to watch some stranger, how he will get twenty points into the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just look at.
Another problem is that, since today's, most annual hers are from perspective players, so look at their records, without controlling the perspective yourself, it's a good receipt as you can arrange.
I admit that games of speed run in which Rogeri Bannisters our electronic time will finish the game at record time is funny.
But no one is a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitchi probably is very interesting.
But what about the skeptic like me?
You've got 55 million visits monthly and is fourth on the top of the Internet operation.
How does Amazon use exactly that?
It's hard to imagine that you're mixed into Amazon Instant Video as elegant as if it could be able to join YouTube.
But you've got something that she wants to reach every company: the hordes of young men that inserents want.
As director Twitche Shear said, Amazon and Twi’s "believing in the future of her" and media doesn't seem to be thrown up, nor as a half-building - whispers.
Second basic lie of creationism.
Next Czech translation of the American Atheist Vlogger Arona Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Fonts are the word of God."
Added a p-video.
The second basic lies of creationism is the faith that holy texts were written by God and no human authors.
When the speakers discuss one of the many things that are in contrast with their religion, they often ask us: Who will you believe?
To God's word, or to man's word?
As if human tests were absolutely unnecessary in comparison with the authority they imagined that they had their doctor.
Only when they say "man", they're talking about the idea.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about God's written people.
If there is intelligent with a creator with a fashion, then it is the one who created a phosphile record that discovers the evolution story, and it must be the one who invented genetic patterns that they respond, and it must be the one who added a number of more evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutional conclusion in the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People could not create any of these things.
But people will lead to the stories, to fabulate.
And there were people who wrote all the texts that suggest that they were the word of God.
Each of the holy teachings of any religion in the world describes himself as the sepulchred people, nor the gods.
People who were "inspired" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or who might listen to the dictate of angels, but those texts were not signed to any other than only mortal men with a certain measure of imagination, nor angels nor any other gods.
If there was one god, it would be a part of all gods of all religion, over-galactical supergenium, the ultimate entity of the whole world.
If such size was sometimes written to a book, there would be only one such book, the only scripture of the Holy Scriptures.
She would be known everywhere in the world, without preachers, parallels or alternatives in any language, because human authors would not be able to handle such work.
And people would not have to believe it, because it was consistent, subjected to verified and truthful evidence, and would show the deep power and wisdom that exceeded all human limits.
They would continue to inspire every reader to one common faith.
If he had written it, they didn't expect anything less.
Only what we see in the place is exactly.
Instead of one religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without a community, and all are continually distributed on what more separate names are continued, seeking contrary truths, and in every manner the divine leadership, without regard to continuing divorce and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Tora, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Coran, the Baha'u'llah of Kitáb-i-Akdah, Zarathütrovi Avesty, Sichch Adi-Granth, Mahabarat Bhagavad-Gita, the book Mormonov, or the book of Urantia, are all considered as "Absolute truth" and "the word of the one true God" and the corresponding representatives of each of them say that the rest are on the road.
The only logical explanation is probably that they are all in a certain measure.
None of the above books has no benefit to the end.
None of them has a evidence resistance, and no one can be confirmed historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I don’t say that I have proved that the Bible is accurate and historical.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apology, because they contain inequality, absurdity and accepting imaginations sometimes considered as true who have already been convinced.
So they can't say that they're evidence of God's wisdom.
Many of them are deceived by ungodly beasts instead of mockery, and many of them say that they have been confirmed by fulfilling the prophecy - that everyone can include the prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
The former teologs admit that all holy texts of any religion were written by human hands and thus are the subject of interpretation, ideas and views of their primitive and often prejudices of political motivated authors, which explain many of the opposers and inequalities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it an opposite, more than one of the other comments.
We need to show again that we have two different authors here whose work has been mixed in the editing review.
He's true that Genesis has more than one author and is not the statement of a clear witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, such as five books of Moses, and Moses does not sign the authority of any of them, because he certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
The experts will agree that Genesis was charged (possibly by Ezdrah) from some of the unexpected traditions of the mouth before less than 2500 years.
Other documents have been transferred at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not even as old as she thinks.
The bridges from the Dead Sea are the oldest archeological findings of texts known for their imperfect foundation of all western monotheisticks, but they are for many centuries younger than the roots of zoroastrian, buddhism, hinduism, helenism, droidic cultures, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
The Christianity began as a ignotic faith, followed the doctrines and episodes and their completely different views of Jesus, which were finally combined in a compromise called Orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups as luciferians were born and discredited by other Bible reviews.
One of these adjustments relates to King Ugaritu, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers represented fundamental threats for young Music religion, the authors of the New Act decided to smile, and Ba'al Zebul, "Lord on the mountain" changed to Belzebub "Pana much".
Thus, the Bible was intended and subwaterly modified from religious and political aspects.
The remaining part of what happened by the New Law was channeled in the fourth century C.E. in the series of Commission decisions on the snow in Nicai.
Four of the Gospels were accepted and sixteen others were rejected by simplifying their hands, as if the ability of things had been given to accept or refused by voting.
The way canon was developed depending on what was read about Sundays in those Christian centers.
What happened to the second week after the divorce in Jerusalem’s church?
What about the Roman church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that it was close to the same evangelical stories.
So the nuclear canon was so developed from the top of the primary church.
So the concil just accepted as an evangelium of any relevant stories that were burning between the masss in that time.
Yet, they received more than ten books from the Bible, even though they mentioned the books that were approved.
We will find scriptures such as the apostles and prophets among the rejected items.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are only words of people and/or are not available anymore?
Who was the editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved if he was a god - author of this advanced mixture of stories, parables and psalms?
The Bible was absolutely written to people, not too dedicated, rather than too much!
That's why it's so big part of her history and it's totally in the mill that it's about anything from the beginning to the end.
We talk about people who believed that hairs and ashes could speak, believed in the swears, blood victims, ritual bottles, decorated objects, fire electrogens, astrology and five animals of magic.
They thought that when they used a bullet that was cut to someone's blood, healing it out of the leper.
We're talking about people who thought that the Queens were the birds, and the birds are birds and whales are fish and drink that it's a whole number.
These people believed that when they show distressed furniture, they'd be born by a tenate.
How could this be said to someone who knows something about genetics?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible was written by a higher residence, it would not contain such errors as it contains.
If she was buried out of the pera's super-substancy and thought as a literal story, she wouldn't contain anything of what it contains.
As a moral spectacle, it is completely unfair because, a part of the Hebrew scriptures has been sepulted by unusual and bigotical divorces that have observed or supported cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, depression of children's members, disuse of children, violence on children, divorce, killing, killing, canibalism, genocide, and prejudices against race, nation, religion, headship and sexual orientation.
To describe their neilids by saying that they do God's cause.
However, creationists still ignore this.
Some of their websites admit that if there is any contrast with the Bible, it must be ignored!
Why?
Because if creationists hadn't had their loved books, they wouldn't have any god.
In their world there is one and another the same.
It's ironic that they refuse God's "partition" as "creating the creation instead of the Creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man as the word of God and the god of the same, and even the depth of the fact that the release of their "health" books will evacuate God as such.
Unless their version of God, but all the versions of God.
The creationists believe that if the Bible fails, God lies.
They cannot assume that God could exist and that the Bible could be wronged at the same time because they cannot separate the doctrine from God.
So it's a type of prayer, where the speaker worships man's compilation, as if these books were a god alone, because they think they are Jehovah's word.
Only God never wrote nor indicated any of the writings of any religion.
All that people have approved or refused to their specific "unchanged word" of any god was designed, built, split, translated, interpreted, and often also intendedly modified and transformed by only mistakes.

Apple iCloud reported to hackers, the public's photos were completed
Screenshot with Unique Files Express
Since the anonymous holder on the 4chan server publishs the nearest and pornographic photos of the American celebrities, he warned that the US Mashable.com server.
It was evidently obtained by an inappropriate access to the Applu servers, where the posters were recorded by automatic storage of images from iPhons and iPads.
Apple hasn't seen the problem yet.
The part of the celebrity refuses the photos as false, but a number of the rights of the photos has already been admitted.
It belongs between them and Jennifer Lawrence, known from the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games series or Mary Elizabeth Winsteadva, for example, playing in a worthless past 4.0.
Hacker's goal is to use obtained images and videos to be embraced.
The collection has evidently shown interest in the American magazines, according to reports on the 4chan server, but the hacker ra wants money from community.
According to the server The Next Web, it is probably very likely to do the weakness in the security of iCloud.
On the GitHub server, it was two days a tool that enabled the passwords to get to the hard forces, thus automatically repeated the login to different passwords.
This tool worked proofly, but Apple closed the security box after two days.
However, the potential attackers had a lot of time to gain access to various aspects before the publication of this tool.
The iCloud users should thus change their password from preventive duties associated with Apple ID.
It's important for the length of the password, not for its compliance.
Adequate is at least 12 characters.
The outcome of photographs to be considered as a safe use of online services.
Although fire servers such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, safe much better than computers in households or small companies, it is upload of sensitive photos in an unsaved form of unsaved risk.
You want to store online explicit photos or any other sensitive contents, encrypt files before uploading first.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic storage of photographs from the phone so that it can run only on the Wi-Fi and after connecting to the buyer.
So you will have the opportunity to move "to security", and mostly you will have a Space to delete unused photos, so they will be locked in the room in the online storage.
Instruction on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of electronic books from Michala Altaira Valáska in PDF.
Hidden way to protect high school scripts
Since the price for a high school script for many students exceeds $1.000 per year, the second year's student came with a nice way to reduce the costs.
He designed a system of payment of books from members of the higher annuals with a proposal for nominal compensation to maintain their sale from the market.
"The book of the calculation, which runs 180 dollars, has been acquired for ten and for the square nugets," says Schro; 19 students at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would be $430, he says.
He lost 120.
According to University Council, a medium student will lose more than $1,200 per year, but students have different opportunities to control these expenditures.
The preferred election of students remains Internet trades and creative solutions such as Schro日.
The accommodation is payment of students, which allows students to use a book semester and often with an extraordinary word before they buy it.
Neebo Inc operating more than 250 libraries in campus areas says that the payment of the book has been doubled since 2011.
The survey in the sector shows that around the fourth books in university books was in the past awarded seamest, says Vice-President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the student texts are purchased, according to the National Association of University Trade in University Books.
Here's 101 best ways to succeed.
Buying online
The prices of some new books may be lower than in the university booking.
A recommended price of the nineth issue of the book “Calculus” Rona Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler are approximately 290 dollars, but it is possible on the Internet on Chegg.com, in a small business specialised at the school, to buy a new $239,99.
Build Used

Matt Casaday, 25, higher age student at Briigham Young, says that on Amazon.com he paid for the useful expression “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new sold for $48.
Universal Teacher Ingrid Bracey, leader of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, encourages students to check whether older publishers are acceptable.
Sometimes there are no changes to work in seminars.
Yes, the elderly issues can be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, they are a favorite alternative for the purchase of useful books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Payment
It is also worth payment of students, if you do well with them, you don't leave them back and you don't want to have them even after the seminar is finished.
You can save up to 80% of costs for a new book.
For example, the student could pay "Calculus" for about twenty dollars on the whole semester.
Please contact the underminders of the trade in which you pay the book, which is, of course, a position for notes, highlights, or injuries and damages.

E-books
Other options are to be watched instead of the normal e-book.
Sometimes, these books are based on electronic licences for a certain time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg pays "Calculus" for six months in approximately 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, the most convenient offers can find literary curses students, because many classics are now available to free station, while natural and technical texts can be very sweet.
In any case, go to business.
Joe Gault, 29, who soon enters the Pepperdine Law School, recommends to conduct according to ISBN because it guarantees you're buying a right book.
Before you negotiate a book via the Internet, make sure it's a real fund, Gault's advice.
He told himself about it on his own skin.

Bahno, it's the same wallet.
And then they found guns in the footnote from the end of the war.
This source stands a cup from the bone of St. Jira.
We discovered growth around and started splitting a flying ship - a mile of meters and a half of the bathroom and a snow sheet.
When we were close to the yellow day, we hit the head," Radomil Novak counted.
We threw her out, cleaned her, and tried that it was an attacking German weapons used by the SS units.
Find is evidently unusual.
According to my information, such weapons were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," added Novak.
All wooden things were exposed to time, so it is unusable.
But her body is keeping her face.
How's the fucking feeling?
One explanation exists.
Maybe there were people who needed to save the weapons used by the SS units, probably from fear that they would not be moved away.
The fascists wouldn't have done it.
They left the guns in the boss," they think they're finding.
The gun was the only thing that the guardians of the Mount of the Spirit of Jessenka found in the fountain.
"They could have also been hand-grounds, these were sometimes around, so we have lost the work, we have carefully lost the bathroom so that there might be an accident, but there was nothing else down there," New York approached.
The find will end in the depository of the Museum on the lock in the nearby Sleez Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I haven't yet released the Czech Employment
Excluse: Chat Currently.cz with the general colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the prison of Perusian separatists.
Kyiv/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... call me from Donec," he may have been excused eight times in the exclusive conversation with Currently.cz Ukrainian General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise director of the Dark Centre of Liberation of Warrior prisoners.
General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in television debat.
When any such interruption was not possible to hear the name of people, their numbers or places where they were - or where Ruban should be - which Ruban's advertising with his proximity at the second end of the phone.
"It's going to be that - go there," sent one of the black discussions with Donek and again we've been.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the ship, some of the tissue pilots and an active anti-government protester.
Yesterday, when we were talking about, he was in Donek.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the prison of Perusian separatists is forty-four hours a day.
Current.ch: You may know that at the side of Peru's separatists are fighting also the Czech.
Our contrascient considers their position to thirty.
But they may be much more.
Have you met with a Czech prisoner at your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I've released the Serbians, the Dublince, the Czech, the Sweden, the Georgian... but the Czech is not yet.
But I know who to turn back in Prague if they attacked your occupied country and could deliver him.
Ukrainian soldier occupied separatists
A.cz: What do you advise to the Czech who adds to the Perusian Separators and Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, as the Czech fights in the Ukrainian poor of volunteers and separatists are occupied, they will be shot without mercy, as any other foreigner.
The separatists view these men as a pleasant soldier, and they think they don't deserve anything else than death.
However, for example, the Ukrainian soldiers take a group of Donecian separatists - and there is a need for the Czech, so they put him in a network and act with him as with a warrior prisoner.
That guy's gonna survive soon.
The Ukrainian party also acts as a state in the war.
A.Ch: And how many have you been able to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand it well, they'll change.
Some sources say that this has been over hundreds of men a long time.
We've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we saved them... We didn't save them before war if they decided to continue in wars.
Salvators are doctors in war, chirurgs, but we're absolutely not.
That's it.
And every day there's another and another.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, four or five.
And they don't have to go about the exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to leave prisoners and just a human request.
A.cz: It is heard that you have received a large authority and even confidence in the Ucrainian company within a few months.
How have you been able to build respect for both war partys?
A hard question.
One of the decades in Kiew gave me a surrounding "what's the crazy general with the ocean bullets."
It won't hurt me.
And maybe it gets the basis of our work.
As the leader of the Ukrainian Housing Congregation, I got the authority before.
I never understand, I don't take and keep the word.
Whatever it happens, so I do honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it's the Ukrainian government, or the Danish or the Luhanian very inappropriate.
They're suffering and killing people?
So I just tell them they're torturing and killing.
And that it's crimes.
I often risk life, even in the exchange of prisoners, and they took... this job for me can mean the end... I don't have to come back.
A.Ch: How many reforms and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long milk) ... to torture prisoners, the Ukrainians and the separatists are at the highest hearing.
Unfortunately.
What about the corrections?
You're playing on the bottom side.
I don't have information about the Ukrainian army too.
Even the signs that the Ukrainian army is commanded to do something similar.
We have a idea of how many rectifications, but the numbers can't be indicated, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Sign me the characters and the motives of Peru separatists.
They're among them, but also veterinarians from Afghanistan.
It's trying to be self-satisfactory and may also democracy in Donek or Luhansk - that's at least what they say.
They don't want any more to play games with Ukrainian oligarchy.
The separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their imperfect resistants - to life and death.
As we're saying, they'd eat them to the horse.
The same dreams and complaints were given to people, in addition, to the end of the day.
And now I'm looking for a little: Russia's supporting separatists and the West, in contrast, the Ukrainian state.
One speculation thinks to be a big, and this one is a little bit.
This is my cup, but it's hiding an immortal opposite in itself.
A.cz: For example, how is one of the strongest leaders of Igor Bezler's separatists?
Always when I'm over the line of war fronts, I'm without weapons and I'm showing to soldiers or weapons with a lower hand.
And I have both sides of these two hundred or three hundred meters on a man or in a optical spectator.
The faces of people who move on me, I'm always looking well... and they can ever get their weapons off.
Leader, experimented Colonel with German and Ukrainian preachers.
It seems to be a Russian deputy, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes Ukraine shouldn't exist.
And if so, just as a small government in a big Russian empire.
In any case, it continues to talk about it and Ukraine considers an outstanding misunderstanding.
Such a state should not exist, according to it.
In fact, he is an immortal enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we are talking about characters - in the Ukrainian TV show, you've marked your Prime Minister Arsenie Jaceňuka as a weak, unconscious and unconscious "leader", which would do the best if he had gone.
I'll get at least five times fear for these three hundred meters.
Why, then, should I secret myself with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak primary and that he hurts our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
Maybe you know the Ukrainians of Jaceňuka will survive with the "country".
And the Queen is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians the animal, from which it would be afraid or in the final respect and authority.
His behavior directly copys the behaviour of the chairman.
Maybe he's a good economy, but as a Prime Minister, he doesn't have the right to weep in the war in the parliament, to play with him his intrigue, to threaten that he puts it... he has to lead the country, control it and protect it in the time of war.
When the country is threatened, there is no premium for family, friends, rest on paying emotions.
He's the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Jaceňuk?
It's like a pubertally girl.
Yeah, he's incredible, but he's also weak because he's never strong... he's worried about Ukraine, but he's still going to everything.
That's why he should go.
Whatever before, better for Ukraine.

Film festival otherwise survive the crisis
After a huge surprise over the starting movie Birdman, whose register Alejandro González Iňárrit was organized between the serious candidates on the Golden Leone, the next day made evidence that the interest of the 71th anniversary festival in Benátkah had sometimes fallen.
Although the number of places in the largest salon increased to fourteen hundred, or because they followed criticisms recognised after Birdman, but for wheels less attractive photos as a document on genocide in Indonesia 60 years of age Seeing silence and other films were socially and from the 99 American houses after Iranian Power, the cinema was quickly residing in the cinema.
Hards of comics
Even the red cobert before the festival palace had not yet covered taxes such as in the past and evidently stopped to get the problem at the last moment in the hotel.
The crisis in Italy is speaking more than anywhere and it is not wonderful that she has reached such a serious institution as Bennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Congratulations, the crisis does not prove the lack of personalities, but the presents exclusively in relation to films.
While younger fans used by the autograms of the comic superhirds of Michael Shannon and Andrewa Garfield, who were successful in the 99 houses of the dramatic roles, for all generations became the main visit of the Legendary Herce Ala Pacina.
Moreover, he's getting in two movies.
In the history of the Perspicuation, outside the concurrence, which touched Barry Levison’s guardian, according to the Roman Philip Roth, a 40-year-old role is close to him: a herce on the top of the glory that suffers depressions from the end of the career and personal life.
But seeing him immediately the second day as a stranger of railways from a foreign town in Manglehorn film, which David Gordon Green attacked, was really unforgettable.
Volpi's cover for the best heroic performance wouldn't have to pass it-- but the artist of Pacino's format needs prices?
Perhaps for the greatest satisfaction of the public is the love of the public, especially the Italian, because even though he was born in New York, Al Papa's fiercely reports to the country from which his parents are buried.
Corps for Italy
Lastly, the Italian movie has been very well in Benática for years.
The black soul registered by Francesco Munzi became after Birdman's first photo refunded by a long distress.
Calabrian footnote mafia is observed in it by viewing family relationships between clans that fight mutually for power and money, and the register has able to put all the provisions for a good movie: quality scenario, camera, music and herce.
He also kept the comer psychothriller Hlad heart, who touched Saverio Costanzo with Albou Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost his own child.
In contrast, from French competitive movies were not expected to be accepted increasingly, nor to purchased for glory, nor to 3 hearts, both works affecting the traditional model of consuming films, which are based on the popularity of herdic representatives.
But at the end, two real excellent films, so Birdman and Black soul, they're not so small at the first half of the festival.
And maybe the festival photos have all the depressions of the subjects, the new picture of Peter Bogdanoviche with the name She's Funny That Way, an amazing commodity mentioned in Benáticas outside the competition and attracted in the American welfare over the 40s, has been able to bring up an advantage for more than one day.

With the transport of medicines from Poland or the sale of drugs, a 15-year-old woman has not yet remained.
That's what it was done by the recompense organiser in the form of a third drug produced," added Rössler.
The criminals have also performed a number of household observations, where drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, payments, injection boxes, hairs and other supports, and items that, according to expertise, can be considered as a complete equipment for the production of metamphetamine.
Dealer was sentenced seven times since 1995
"From the available evidence, then, the police have proved that the main organization has been seven times in the case of the executive crime, the woman has not been judged since 1995," added the police speaker.
The last arrested in 2006 was subsequently deceived for a criminal offence and a seventy-year-old self-mechanism, which was dismissed on freedom, has been judged nine times since 2009.
And in the case of this, it was extremely because of the powerful crime.
The investigator has committed three men and women from the destruction of a criminal act unapproved production and other addictions with mild and psychotropical substances and foods that threaten them to the decades.
In three persons, the investigator finally gave the State Representative and encouraged us to deal with the commitment where the judge finally placed it," said the speaker.
The fourteen-year-old recidivist ended on freedom.
His position and role in this case was not as essential as for the final accused ones.

References on the flat prohibition of hazard are held on the day of the communal elections of Praha 1 and Praha 8.
At the present time, for example, the prohibition of hazard is applied in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
A report from the same debts will change either in the case of a street art called busking.
It takes it, in particular Praha 1, which has already sent to the magistrate to places that the current list of prohibited places would like to expand.
The musicians don't even want Praha 5 in the Angel's area.
The statement of regulating forests is a few months in the city, yet it is not completed.
The location of heroes and the busking problem solves citizens.
Only the representative of the capital city may be issued or managed.
The Council has only a advisory voice, and it doesn't be necessary to issue the votes.
Last week he placed victories to the proponents of Scotch independence in hands
The Scotch independence campaign was in danger that this error would make use when she almost placed on billboards at the whole Scotch question whether they wanted to be rich.
But you do not get to the hearts of Scotch electors by calling on their money, nor getting their respect when you continue to threaten them.
The moral of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although only a few Scotches are still walking into the bones today.
They almost have a longer trend to remove changers from the temple than to allow them to dictate how to vote.
The chief of Scotch nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore, in television discussion, again questioned his companion, the Union of Darling, whether it is willing to respect "suvered by the Scotch people" if Scotch electors vote for independence and start supporting a single currency for Scotland and England.
This gave Darlinga to choose between the Scotch civil society and the London financials, and with a grim falling into this past.
Of course, Darling doesn't support the mandate of Scotch elections.
However, the debate on how Scotland's currency would be neutralized has already been more than one.
What is rightly motivated by Scotland electors is the fairness, the work of opportunities and the defense of State health, which have free citizens.
Darling supported the London banker in monetary matters and also called the idea of protesting against health privatization.
As Salmond said, "He entered the bed with the conservator."
This is a very dangerous position for each Scotch policy.
Each Scotch elector knows that Scotch businessmen are in bed with conservators.
This confirmed David Cameron, who spoke not to the electors in Scotland, but to the "boss" association, to the British Industrial Confederation.
It begins to be that Cameron’s refusal to discuss independence with the Scotch Prime Minister Salmondem was a serious challenge for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a white absent home.
They'd almost respect him if he had come to debate with the Scotch Prime Minister.
Cameron at least said that Scotland could be a successful independent country.
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's just physically painful to him.
What he's doing is: The shots don't shoot up, and they have to accept what is.

Pessimistic beginning of school by Milosche Urban
Illustration to the story of the Latest Year
Miloš Urban Latest year
The end was the best of the last week, which wasn't going anywhere, and we've just pulled up with the grandmother's flight, quiet before the storm, quiet before stress.
New clothes when you got to get out of Tuzex, bottles from East Germany.
Reading the Quick Shops, already covered, switching around the mountain around the Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tenis curtains, it was no longer driving, the sun was cold behind and the rams, covered papers on the wound.
I'm still going to sleep at the middle of the 11th week, I'll be worse, a minute before I'm going to sleep from a few minutes to two hours, and then get up to half the seventh.
He's coming on Monday.
Most of them don't worry, however, the year's deceased in the school.
Using in a mirror light on a plague and looking like a plastic place in a glassed weight, there is the school, U.S.A.
Snapshot with a deeply raw worm, and before her old known faces, and a couple news, guys more exhausted, girls more finger.
There's funny, they're avoiding, it's just interesting in how unfortunately they're holding up and how quickly they're here.
And these growing girls who came to cry, are now laughing at something histerical, like something changed in their lives throughout the empty days, while I'm old.
And again the new firstborn, some nervous, and other pleasure, why are they all over here?
'Cause it must, the educational military obligation.
So inside, the cold wheel of the floor and the easy pack of deinfection, the thrown schooler with a mope, despite the same thing that, as it seems, is the key of the cups of the box, where they are allowed to leave the teacher and which are still so small.
For the flash.
There's no one who's born in memory now, it's nicely spread, but it'll be worse in a week.
It's just from that idea, it's getting a throat and starting a head pain.
The head, which is still worse to take the mathematics, the devil game for the chosen, between which I don't hold and never.
Again, the three and four, no five, hide before trying, fall into la and be the best to be there, be there, there only exist as a name in the class, and then dream the stories of the lovers and beautiful buildings, of the antenes in the universe where no one disturbs, doesn't smit anybody and doesn't smite the feet.
The longest year has ten months.
And it's just the first day, now as a year ago.
The born daughter let her die.
It's threatened to the exceptional trial - Novinky.cz
The first birth came in March 2012 in the public toilet cabinet on bus in Jihlava.
Without help, she was born a girl, who was packed into the prepared deck, hided under the bound and brought her to the traveller, where she put her into a carrier with some tens of meters from the street.
Family Road to School
It happened to me sometimes before.
I was on the way to school.
I had to go to the bus, and I was born there.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I've cut the pupped cup that I was wearing to school," she's described and realized she's seeming to be injured for pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, the body of the child entered into the bathroom and took the body out of the bathroom, washed into the black igelite pitch, and hid and left under the travel in her grandma's house in Havlic Broad," she stated in the complaint that it wasn't very clear when it came to the death of the newbornness.
It could be in decades, but even a few hours after birth, breaking when covering the deck or putting it under the bound, shaking or carrying out the unlocked pupil.
On the scenario, the next year on the board was repeated.
A woman nearly unexpected from February to 12 April, when the dead child was found by appropriate witnesses under crowds at the fisherman in Havlicbrodska, she was born secretly.
This time in a bathroom underground apartment in a family house.
Without verifying whether a living boy was born, without breaking and lifting a bubble that was turned around the wheel, she put the child into a few plastic packs, meaningly the igelite cups and left it in the bathroom.
On the next afternoon, he and his partner brought him to the fisherman.
Finally, he gave her a friend.
The father of both kids was just a friend who didn't know of the weaknesses of the partners.
Even so, they are not standing before the court now, it was only charged for a sin against the Memorial Law.
It was also the one who turned back to the police.
I don't like it wasn't deceived as a partner.
With the kid he manipulated against my desire.
I know that my solution was not correct, but it came to me as a human moment," she didn't hide a deceived injury that was evidently obedient to the man's relationship and feared him.
In the course of his responsibility, a young woman spoke relatively balanced.
The swords in the eyes of her until the moment she spoke about the relationship with her parents, from which she left from after the full - time age.
She didn't want to kill.
"They follow me every 14 days to visit, do all for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't call me a kid because I didn't want the kids, I looked young.
Furt, I wanted to give him to the babybox, but I don't know what happened I didn't do so.
I can't explain it to you," she answered the question of the judge.
However, she refused to handle the thought and purpose of killing the newborn.
The second child, according to her statement, was also born dead.
She didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
"I've even limited the smoke," she said.
Although the pregnancy had been seen in both cases, all of the repeated questions claimed that he had a health care that he was injured.
And that's a friend.
The vote of the calculation will continue in the court of the courts' exposures of the judges.
In the middle, the judgment could already be made.
Women are threatened by criminal rate up to 18 years of procedure, where appropriate, with exceptional concern.

Prodemocratic activists in Hong Kong providing Chinese authorities on the day after voting decision
There was a group of people loyal to Peking who had a Chinese flag.
The Standing Commission of the National Human Congress on Sunday approved the elections in 2017 in Hong Kong only two of the three candidates.
All candidates must first receive the support of the nomination committee, which will probably be set out from the members of the Peking.
For the purposes of this Decision, the opposition democracy is unable to reach election letters and accept pro-democratic activists to renew the promise and protect the financial center of the Hong Kong Protection Centre.
The political reform in Hong Kong is the main challenge, the Chinese leaders fear that the democracy request will be extended to other cities.
Following that Peking published in June a detailed report on Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, the democratic activists organized an official reference on elections in the special official circle, and hundreds of thousands of people entered into the town trade quarter, and made it.
The pressure of the Prime Minister of Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese chair office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several prints were also to be discussed by the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislati-Commission of Zhang Ronghsun and the address of the Director of the State Council of the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
Student activists announced that the afternoon sheds before the Hong Kong Government office.
In the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned the democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin requests Kyiv to start the "State Sovereignty" negotiations with the East Ukraine
According to a description of the Russian newspaper, Russian President Vladimir Putin requested that the Ukrainian Government stop the fight against separatists on the east of the country and immediately initiate the negotiations on the "statal sovereignty" deteriorated by the Ucrainian government.
His speaker Dmitry Peskov explained the fact that Putin had not intended to indicate that the Eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would be part of Russia, but that their status in Ukraine should be assured that Russian speakers would have the right to protect their rights and interests.
Putino's call to the Kyoby Government to act with Peru's rebellion as equals to themselves, corresponds to the manifest strategy that is carried out from the emergence of disturbances ago five months ago: Help separatists to occupy the territory and bring Ukrainian government to share the newly announced New York real independence in order to connect the West to Russia.
In the Challenge for the first channel, the State TV Putin judged the Ukrainian military action that had to recover the Eastern Donec and Luhansk, which were controlled by separatists in March and April after Moscow anacted on March 18 March Crimean halfports belonged to Ukraine.
Crems and separatists recently occupied territory were marked as “Novoruska” or “New Russia” as a term referring to the celebrated prerevolutional days of the Russian empire.
The Russian Printing Agency Itar-Tass published the words of Putinova, which means "illusions" everyone who believes that they are peaceful negotiations, because Ukrainian politicians have started the campaign before Parliament's elections on 26 October, while the Governing Units attack civil residence in controlled separatists.
"In the interest of people living in these areas, we must immediately start significant negotiations, not only on legal matters but also on the political organization of the company and on the status of the State Sovereignty of the South East Ukraine," he stated.
Peskov said that Putinov's injury to State suverenity was thought in the context of a wide autonomy, which has been conducted by Kiev for a few months and which is to disturb Russian fears of speaking from threatening cultural and language rights.
Peskov noted that the needed autonomy could only be the Ukrainian government.
No matter how to negotiate between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "for it is not the conflict between Russia and Ukraine but the internal Ukrainian conflict."
The extent of the speaker Kreml, which had to correct the "fair interpretation" of Putin notes, highlighted the access to Russia's leadership to resolve the rise of separatists in the east, which is different from the opened occupation of Krim, where the two-million population is in line with the ethnic Russian.
Moscow should be a lot more intensely anacted as Donýck and Luhansk at East Ukraine, since the 6.5 million people have not been Russian and public changes, which have been undertaken before conflict, showed a large support for sustaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomates on international forums would allow regional governments in Ukraine to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and, in fact, to give Kreml a real control over the territory that would link Russian pén pe·n with Krym.
The Black Sea Sea Halostrate anected five months ago is the seat of the main Russian maritime footnote, the marine trade territory and the historical villages.
The areas between Russian Rostov and Krym are also a central downward, manufactured and covered, which produce important components for Russian Army.
The Ukrainian President Petro Porosenko, during its in-surance manifestation of 7 June, proposed the Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, to consider the changes in the settlement that would increase their financial and language status to the various regions.
This vision of autonomy is significantly different from the creml and separatists' vision. The Moscow is accused of weaponing and inflation of violence.
Putinov's last call to act as a separatist after the next procedure of the rebels last week after the Russian units in the East Ukraine and the balls from previously silent Asian Sea.
The Russian forced separatists have overcome the control of Novoazov's strength that Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a secretion with a view to occupying the strategic southern territory until Krem.
This has enhanced a great civil and military effort to deal with Mariupol, a combination with metalurgical combinations of 500 000 people, which lie between Novoazov and the strong entrance gate on the Crymean Pool.
On Saturday, the rapporteur came to the meeting of the head representatives of the European Union in Brussels and invited the action to prohibit further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which is independent of the last 23 years.
"We draw close to the point from which there is no return," he warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of strangers in Ukraine.
The summit of the EU has not supported any definitive steps - leaders of exemption to accept other sanctions against Russia in the case of unspecified scale of Ukraine crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council on the Sabbath reporters in Kiev said that Ukrainian soldiers had to download from their positions in Italy after the last week two colons of Russian rounded vehicles and 1.000 military units came to Donekia to support oblivious separatists.
From the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were arrested in Iceland at Russian invasion, they were changed on Sunday by 10 Russian leaders arrested a week ago in Ukraine.
In the scandal with discovered clusters, the Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved

Fotbalist Sigmy took Lebra, and without playing
Olomo · - Hroms and blacks, which the compulsor of the Olomouck Sigmy Joseph Lébr set up for his last week, seems to be the past.
It would have finally been brought from Opavy to a point for a free remise.
The club boss' seat and warmness, but they're just a little swimming.
The money for payments could come to the club soon.
"I'm gonna leave another shot like I spoke about this last week, but I'm far more optimistic," Lebr confirmed that, despite that Sigma didn't win, players convinced her with improved performance.
The fighting and saturation with which we played mainly in the second half time was exactly what I want to see from players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that he doesn't win.
When they played so from the beginning of the season, I'm convinced that we haven't lost yet," it thinks Lébr.
Sigma in Opava stopped the introduction pressure of homes, then the game was equipped and in the second half it was already better.
After Kalvod's winning, the companions shot, but their options were not reached, so they couldn't win.
The result is not according to our imagination.
We missed complete satisfaction but only one changed chance," said Lebr, who, though, doesn't think that the change in the access of the Ballists only caused his exhibition.
There's certainly been more aspects.
"Well, from my side, from the trainer, or from the fans," said Lebr.
Sigma has to calculate with pressure
The players did not want to comment on the event in the past week.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to leave it," he crossed the head of the young man Michal Reichl.
Without a comment, he left the question to Lébrova from the last week attacker Václav Vašiček, who did not change the greatest opportunity of Sigmy in the Sabbath.
But he's just talking about the pressure.
We're still under pressure.
Everyone wants to get out on us.
Today, we showed that when we're fighting and running everyone after the fuck, it's going," he said.
Warning takes to heart
Even Leoš Kalvod has not seemed to be the most simple view of the atmosphere that was dominated in Olumucia last week.
It was too hard.
But I think the boys knew that, and today it was to see that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Although it wasn't even before that they wouldn't want to fight and defeat it," the Olomouck trainer mentioned.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It was a long time before we were compared to the firm and realized what the other boy was about.
That it's not just about the battle, but mainly about the warfare," Kalvod said.
There's no hope that Sigma's going to work in the next passports since the beginning.
"I wouldn't believe it," added.
