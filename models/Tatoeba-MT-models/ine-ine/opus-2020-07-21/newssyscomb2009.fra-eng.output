The Triomph of Right Populars in Austria, they have 29 per cent per cent
According to the preliminary results, the previous parliamentary elections in Austria have made a sensitive deficiency of the two parties that form the current large coalition, as well as a significant strengthening of popular parties.
The Austrian Popular Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffers particularly important losses.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepares a triomphal return on the political scene at national level.
According to the preliminary results, the socialists (SPÖ) remained, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the first political force of the country, however, compared to the elections of 2006, lost 5.5 per cent of votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 per cent loses nearly nine per cent of the voices, has ended worse.
It is the worst results of the two large parts of the after-government, in particular for the population party, which has declined the previous elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
On the beginning of July, when the OECD is leaving the coalition, the population party had a significant progress on the SPÖ.
However, the electors punished them in order to have left the Government to extinguish.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations on the possible demission of the chief of the party and the current Wilhelm Molterer Chanceler were proposed.
The observators believe that this could occur on Monday, in the extraordinary Council of the Guideline of the Party.
Such evolution would be easier for the way to the outcome of the highest election result, namely the renewal of the great coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, due to the strengthening of the two peoples of the right - freedoms (FPÖ) would have received 18 per cent and 11 per cent of the votes - the socialists expressed the fear of a repeated period of 1999, when the population party agreed with the peoples (for the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was that the BZÖ was separated in 2005 on a common government, which even produces sanctions from the European Union.
Hader, who has already said that he was ready to acquire with any part and that he predicted the return to Vienna at the national political scene, appearing to be raised on this development.
The last party to have access to the parliament is the Verts, but they have lost and repeated, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in the fifth position.
Of course, no other parties have granted the limit of four per cent and accepted the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are risked to refresh
If we could not resolve the problem with the Czech researchers accused in India, accused of illegal cafards, it would be, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain refreshment of the Czech relations.
The Minister declared it today in New York, after having met his Indian Ombudsman Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then, a certain refrigeration would occur," he noticed after the meeting, performed after a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, by speaking out, that the exhaustive power could hardly intervene in Judic cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Svacha, who was distorted from the accusation and punished of an amendment, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, where the case was placed under the jurisdiction of this.
"The problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kuchera, condemned to three years of prison, would be to call for a higher instance.
He could therefore ask for freedom and wait for the judgment in freedom, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner also expressed himself in the same sense during the talkers.
"The advice to call to a high court, after which it could be grateful," said the Chairman of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "a competent legal support", mentioned the Indian Minister.
He also said that such aid was already brought to them from India.
"We want to keep the best relationships with India, which have a tradition that continues for many years.
The Indians also have it," indicate Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to the CTK, he highlighted before his partner that the Czech Republic had a great importance to the issue of the Czech Entomology.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great deception," he said.
The Minister questiones whether he has received the promise to take care of the matter from India.
"I have already received a lot of promises," he only said.
A Czech Republic arbitrates the fight for the Sea Fund
It approaches a wall e-card, representing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
But he doesn't interest in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent sea fund.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said the Italian jury Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His head, the director of the Division, the Czech jury Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and full time to another.
The deal of work and enthusiasm characterizes the realistic atmosphere.
The marine fund hides a little known world until now, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms for inconstant instinct, which can contain the key for the development of a drug against cancer.
A larger background than the closed earth
The literal states have beginning from our day to breathe in the new submarine territory.
According to a United Nations Convention, they serve their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially the area of which the continental shelf is called, which often has occurred to several hundred miles from the coast of the country.
This can, at the end of the Convention, determine all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, it is considered as continental shelf the part of the marine fund and its subsol, which is a natural prolongation of the continent under the sea.
It was beyond the limits of the Literal Sea, often also over two hundred miles of marine, representing that economic," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned provides to the Commission for the establishment of the foreign borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation based on costing prospections and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparation.
"On of our roles is to give the Commission legal and scientific and technical assistance.
until now, the committee took place five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the three recently mentioned countries have been successful for the time," Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which is the first to consider, extended its submarine properties, has recently known a global retainment.
The New Zealand, too, won the territory - the extent of the marine fund, which has been assigned to her last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square miles, which represents the extension of the country multiplied by six.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in the prospects.
The benefit they will take in the future of the marine fund's exploiting will be, as they are designed, unappreciable.
Progressively, other countries will present their request at their turn.
They can do it within a 10-year-old period after they have committed the "Monto Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, starts the area of the Ocean Fund, proclaimed by the "Common Patrimoin of Humanity".
There is no State anymore plays a position.
The right to extract in this area is attributed by an international institution established by the Convention.
"Nevertheless, we don't miss it, the Marine Fund is not a Klondike," he said by exagering director Mikulka, indicating that "their areas are just defined and their scheme is enclosed in a contract."
Czech Republic in the Fisheries
A part of the Marine Fund belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former block of the East countries in the framework of the "Interoceanmetal" common organization.
This was obtained in 1991, according to the Convention, as well as by investors from some other States, the status of which it is called "a penalty investor".
It has the right to extract in the areaClipperton in the Ocean, which is between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor exceeds the surface of the ex-Checoslovakia.
The background is moved there, it is a kind of submarine replique of Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it on an extension with a total surface of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a rich gear in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, cowry, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian worker in the division, provides an example of such a concretion.
She recalls a small pomme of earth, or, with a little imagination, the mythic shoem, who, the end, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the place for the release of ottes
The Egyptian Government had requested Germany's aid for the resolution of the crisis of otages - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, special units had been ready but never passed to action.
More details about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists removed in Egypt are reflected.
According to the indications of the Ministry of Interior and the Defence Minister, German special forces also participated in the safeguard operation indirectly.
Thus, both Federal Army specialists and officers of the GSG 9 of the federal police and federal police office, as well as logistic experts of the Technischen Hilfwerk was found at the place of release.
As the portfolio of the Ministers on Monday evening, the German forces were finally not required, the hosts who freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of freedom by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the basis of support force.
"This hasn't succeeded until there," a portfolio of the Federal Ministry of the Interior stated.
The attackers had removed the group of tourists from five Germans, five Italians, a Roman and eight Egyptian companions.
After their release in the wilderness south of Egypt, the otages were changed into the border area between Egypt, Libia, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of payment holders has remained too vague, as the details of the release or possible remuneration payments.
Those who were saved have come healthy and unless to Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the released ottes were under the protection of the German ambassade.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the moment no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the "image" magazine, the five holidays and special forces should have discovered at the border of a Airbus of the air armies and arrived in Germany March.
The room of representatives of the United States is the safeguard plan
The first room of the United States Congress failed to save the financial markets lower than $700 billion.
Dow Jones was broken in the album.
At 227 votes against 206, the United States representative room rejected the backup plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls of the President of the United States George W. Bush and the political men at the head of the two parties, the programme that had to join the chaos of the financial markets did not obtain the majority.
In a dramatic manner, the parties tried deeply to convince the opposers of the well-based plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, had called the Members to a favourable vote, even though the plan was unfair.
"It is difficult to have political responsibility for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he agreed.
Once again the vote, Dow Jones was lower than six per cent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the static salvation plan could capoter.
He returned a little while before the end of the vote, for then, after the failure announcement, to fall again.
Experts are now designed for new serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to enable the programme to enter into force, the approval and the room of Members and the secretary are necessary.
Organizators report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
As regards reservations for the next months, the business number has just increased in comparison with the year-Winter season, even more than 30 per cent.
Despite low-tournal perspectives, the German travel seat remains insatiable to this study.
With regard to the reservations for winter season, the travel agencies have recorded a number of businesses more than 31 per cent compared to the same period in the year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) provided in Berlin on Monday.
According to the application of the GfK Markets Research Institute, increased booking numbers already dominate the months of automne.
Thus, the number of wins would have gripped around 11 per cent compared to 2007, confidenced by the DRV.
The sources of these results are the numbers of the GfK, which each month analyze 1200 travel agencies and make estimates for the global market.
Reserves of travel from end to 2008 and will be recorded.
As a result of the low course of the dollar, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, the DRV stated.
There, the reservations would happen about an animal.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our country would be special destinations seeked by the Germans.
The specially organized travels are very requested, explained by the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of increased energy and food prices, the costs would be "easier for the customer than for a individually organized travel".
Consumers can economise money among others with the reductions of anticipated reservations or all Inclusivie offers, explained Laepple.
The elderly months have also been so preserved that an increase in the winner numbers will be recorded again in comparison with the last year - even though another study, the number of Germans who entered a travel has been decreased in comparison with the year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continually, the beer in litre pickets and the collectivity in Tyrolian costumes to design.
A event at the festival of the beer.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we actually don't have a common thing.
It is blonde, television animator and brings a tirolian costume on measurement.
I've got my hair broken, I'm a student, and my robe is a chance.
But one thing relates to us: at least three minutes at the beer festival, and the photographs already go on us and fill their memory card - very flat, and this at my first visit at the beer festival.
That's how we're doing friends.
The tirolien good market cost reaches its goal.
As tourists of the beer festival and normally residents north of the Whitewurst equator, my feeling of goodness in the traditional costume was until now limited.
But once on the Teresa place, everything is half worse.
Each or almost takes a tyrolian costume or cocktails; no one seems black or harmful - it's totally normal.
Only the tabler of my tyrolian costume collects a few bizarres cuts of them at the station of the chocolate bananas.
A bavarois notes that I would have mistaked my table: "Left means free, in the middle of the widow, right to the back of the widow."
Discretely, I triped my bowl back to the left.
"It's better," she said to me, "you're quiet.
Others don't get so bad for these flirt subtils and have simple flats on which it is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their back-train without being invited there.
The young man at the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, comes from England and comes for the first at the festival of the beer.
He finds this "gorgeous", with a "oooo" along.
He's doing all of this after he's been deceived from the shop he had been drinking before.
Besides this incendie mouth that everyone thinks to be a powder.
Thus, Bob is one of these "saved pessers" tristly famous.
Others do not have the chance of getting away from alcohol in this way.
Nearly eight hours of evening, scarlets cover on the place of the festival and need to take care of poor drinkers.
Instead of getting in myth - always by four, they travel their covering of tents in tents.
This works in this way for most visitors of the beer festival: we're going to be empty, we're returning full of it.
Those who rest in the circle of the boiled under the bathroom are not low.
"These are those who can't do anything anymore," one of the teachers cries to me in response to my question and then disappears in the middle.
Victima d'a·aʹ identified by the police
A petroleum of 63 years, died in the hospital after heating by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in Friday after midnight, in town, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romeford, but she died there later.
Following the age, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspicious of dangerous conduct.
He was released since, in caution.
Turkey extended its diplomatic horizons.
While before Turkey thought to join the European Union, the European powers had quickly been attached to its backland.
On the side of Bosfore, at 20 steps, it may be, in Asia, one of the most finest rikes of his emperial ambition devastated.
The garage of Hydarpasha was designed in a neo-renaissance, by two German texts, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
This is at least what the guides make.
The monument is available for horses at the bottom of the platforms, observation tours to each of its angles, as some German provincies.
The stones are salted.
All the building is in ruin.
But once inside the voted billet, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The garage was invoked in 1908 by a German, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retardator of imperialism, wanted to carry out its medial domination ambitions through this iron path that comes to Bagdad, and has the most known earth under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions were exhausted during the First World War.
His ways of making were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs' irregularities.
The isolation of its region around, born by the ice frontiers of the Froide War, has been completed.
. The British and empire forces progressed beyond Egypt and moved the Turks and their German alliations outside Palestinian and Eagle.
But there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha garage.
In 1917, a loaded train of munitions exploded by destroying its subtil toit.
The Turkish sources say that it's a sabotage.
Since then, she fell slowly in ruin, involved in the midst of the history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all east points, at least symbolically, is to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The Party of Justice and Development to the Authority, the ACP, has developed a new foreign policy for the country.
The isolation of its region around, born by the ice frontiers of the Froide War
Now it's time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has noteworthy relationships with Israel and the §, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I shiped on a wagon-lith in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish AKP Suât Kiniklioglu, a foreign policy expert.
On the next morning, after a traveling of 10 hours and half, on bruising rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I would finally, in the Turkish capital presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to its past German.
But the AKP with its well-known islamist racines represents an example of change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP's general quarter, an ultra modern structure, expressly built in stones and acids, in a development quarter, in the middle-building commercial centres and in many fisheries in which middle costum-cravate-human and female managers meet for maternal businesses.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right center politician from any other part in Europe.
Costume, cravate, and he has even a Black Berry.
The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now in its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an error," he said.
Turkey has been cut off its back country.
Now she has to look towards the east and the west at the same time.
That wasn't the case of one and another.
She had to do both of them.
"but here, at a moment, I asked if" Turkey should not choose?"
"Turkey" said "not want to choose between both."
He then highlighted an aspect that almost all of those with whom I could speak, rejected me with heart: The Turkish railway is not only going to the Middle East but also to the Caucase, and around the Black Sea, so it is a benefit for Europe and the United States and for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message of a Europe that is metaphorically traveling on railways to Asia and the Middle East.
From return to the Hydarpasha garage, after another night without sleep, I repeated to these two Germans, Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu, who followed the building of this building there are 100 people.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in great part, be found in the hands of Turkey.
While I was at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosfore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was called "the disease of Europe".
At least, there is no doubt on the continent that could provide this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: The musical officer at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceived on 11 September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
By being part of his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic chief of young people, Proteus.
The chariot had to include the less than 21 men, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years of age left the chariot.
The name "Proteus" (which changed mythology) represented the will and ability of the chariot to manage any kind of music that he had been presented to him, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical veratility produced by such a young chariot was often impressive, always exciting, and that is through the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod repeated to "leave music to speak for herself".
He would have said, "The coach knows what he wants."
Everything's here, in music.
So you're songing!"
His bathroom technology was absolutely, precisely, even if never dictatory or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he was higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver had to be called a horseman, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during 1962 to 1982, when he was conducting the Philharmonic Guildford.
In the last 40 years, I have seen more than a hundred cent of his concerts, and I can honestly say that no one of them has ever disappointed me and sometimes they have even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated the leaders who, he, "concentrate only on certain people".
He'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (deceived on 25 September) stated that "In 1946, he had recovered his economic studies in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma Research, while he did a BSc, a MA and a PhD."
This is what was issued by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953, he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time ended a PhD tess on the British plastic industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then held in 1958 under the title The British Ruber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and the age of 1952, at the universities of Itànois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Notingham for I.Nois.
The reason for which Woodruff chose to dissimule this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Filosoe
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary, are fantastic.
They attached me to the fact of their simplicity and strength they sent and because they always treat the protagonists with a lot of respect.
A exposure that transmits many feelings.
Resino knows to catch magical moments."
Second assault for the super wins of Honda
In November, Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of Jazz model.
If his pre-decessor had already a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even larger internal space.
This is a few raffined mechanisms that increase the comfort of conduct and allow more importance to economy.
A evolution against a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line to the model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are many.
Among them there is a innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before reviewing the new model, this new Honda Jazz will come six years after the marketing of the first generation.
On the other hand, Honduras renewed this model in a shorter time than the other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a fenoway of wines on other markets.
This is the case of Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Exactly in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less than one million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
Today, Honda predicts that this new Jazz will allow him to embrace its wines in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese mark marketed in 2007 83.000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 she thought to sell 100,000, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8.000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda's wines in Spain.
The responsibility of the Spanish branch hopes to sell 2.000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the outcome of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to pall in large part the weight of wines in Spain.
In fact, the responsibility of the mark hopes to end the year with a sale of 22.000 cars is 4.000 cars unless in 2007, or a decrease of 16 %.
Thanks to this growth of wins, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1,8%, compared to 1,6% in the past year.
The Japanese mark also hopes for a part of the market of 2 % in 2010.
Honda hopes 日 this marketing part when the new model is going out.
It is Insight, a hybrid at five doors and a compact size - 4,37 meters long - on which Nipone company hopes to market about 200,000 cars per year in the world.
According to markets and estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the insight wins will be made to the United States, while the other half remaining will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled during the first three months of the next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valence.
In relation to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 metres (five meters in addition), its width of 1.69 metres (two meters in addition) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five meters.
On the contrary, the height is not 1,52 metres.
The dimensions increase and the internal space also.
This gain is, on the one hand, due to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to introduce a reservation of essence in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the coffre - which has a double background system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in addition to the coffre of the first generation.
It is necessary to notify that these dimensions are the version of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the ability to cover the Honda Jazz ↓L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as back fires or panoramic toilet - is the improvement of the access to back places.
The doors that give access to the behind seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, along with the back doors of the first Jazz, which would be opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
Engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two extent propulsors of 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
The two engines have a i-VTEC which reduces the extent consumption and CO2 emission that makes the engine stronger and increases the engine system.
The first engine 1,2 litres develops a power of 90 horses of 6.000 t/min and 114 Nm of couple at 4.900 t/min.
This propulsor - on Jazz’en reached 78 horses - presents a extent consumption of 5.3 litres to 100 km and 125 gram CO2 emissions.
In comparison with the propulsor, which on the generation reached 83 horses, now reached 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres to 100 km and 128 gram CO2 emissions.
The 'Wheel Way' that avoids the operations
In order to promote the development of a’s prevention, Nissan inspired himself, this time, of nature, in particular of abeilles.
The Japanese company created a robot that, imitating the flight of abeilles, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps to prevention.
The Engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have constructed this small robot in a comparison with the Centre for Sciences and Advanced Technologies of the Prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of Public Relations on Technology and Research and Development of Marks, BR23C represents the exorbitation of the Nissan security bulk.
This robot will allow vehicles in the mark to predict the admissions.
Property of his flight, each abeil created his own personal space in a oval form that is much to the Nissan security buckle.
But the most important are the eyes of the abel, which can be seen in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows him to steal without interruption within his own personal space.
To regenerate this visual function, the engineers pointed out what it was called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are located on a distance of two meters and in a 180 degrees range, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the micro-emissioner immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"When he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a beach and will immediately change direction by doing 90 degrees or more of his wheels to avoid the discharge.
The largest difference in any other existing system is that evasion management is totally instinct.
If so, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, "explicate Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory of Movement and main engineer of this project.
In contrast to an abeil, the robot can not be turned up or down or in diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions, depending on what its roots allow him and not in infinite directions like the birds.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Each second, this device must only handle information and act these data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of preliminary hands, so it can continue with only a few dozens of KB memory.
It can be surprised, but we don't talk about giga-bytes of memory, nor even megabytes."
This represents the first car for the development of new instantious preventions, which will be introduced into the series cars in a decade of years after Nissan.
The robot walks with lithium-polymer bacteria, which are more efficient and sustain more than lithium-ion bacteria.
The other possible application of this system in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being hypothecized.
It is necessary to recognize that the United States Tresor, in addition to the fact that he has a lot of liquid to make plans, is not genetic.
Face the crisis, and to avoid shiping Americans in hypothics with solvency banks, they created a game to avoid failing: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
It's to say 'Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The luguary aspect of this apartment and especially the Master of Hotel led us to think of several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And especially where to do it.
It is sure that this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's a more reserved game for adolescents.
What if the game ends?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital in MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the income at his table tour of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank of Japan, which will deduce nine billion dollars to take 21% of his capital, a new receipt by a strong decrease of its course of Bourse.
One week after a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at a single price of 25.25 dollars, or a total of three billion dollars.
The detained price is less than 19% to the accounting value of the licences at 31 to 31.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible licences which provide 10% and assess a conversion price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be carried out on a average unit price of 29 dollars, or 28% above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley's action lost 6,79% to $23.07 to $17:00 GMT.
"This strategic covenant is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to holding status," explained John Mack, the Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statue last week, which must allow her to diversify its activities but the fact that it has passed under the Federal Reserve Authority.
Its covenant with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis requires the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a much greater attitude than previously.
Moreover, the procedures presented on Monday show that the agreement was made during the last days: the last Monday, Morgan just announced that he would sell up to 20% of his actions to Japanese for about $8,5 billion.
"And a week ago, Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the MUFG's ex-director, explained that the participation would be completely composed of actions.
But in view of the current situation of economy and market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its titles to Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20% of the benefit by action.
The Agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert to a half of its preferential titles to assets if these recently exchange over 50% above the cost of conversion, or about 47 dollars, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capitals will enable him to enter investment opportunities, strengthen its balance and enhance its liquidity.
However, a portfolio of the group has given specifications on the strategic projects of the two new allied projects.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should show an animal solvency of approximately 15%, one of the best of the sector.
Morgan indicated that he had "rightly" allocated his balance from the end to the end.
The last weeks have been testing for the group, which has seen its course of Bourse under half, while the cost of the insurance against a deficiency risk was involved.
This cost reflushed Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "on" of the large Wall Street investment banks after the faillites of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's racket, announced that there were 15 billion dollars, partly with Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa to Quito this Monday.
Refund the Republic around the socialism of the 20th century.
This is the common project of Venezuela Hugo Chavez, Bolivien Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, as well as his approval and friends, is the third who voted in a new Constitution project.
The mission completed since 64% of the electors voted "yes" to the referendum, official results of 80% of the subsequences.
According to these results, "no" received 28%, 7% of the suffocations were nuls and 0.7% were white votes.
In order to adopt the Constitutional draft, half of the suspects had to be more than one.
Saturday, two reviews made at the outcome of the voting offices and a decount of a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of "yes" which was between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also revendicated on Sunday night on Monday the victory of its Constitutional project.
"The Constitution triomphed in exciting way," he assured the Equatorians at the seat of the Guayaquil Government, 280 km south-west of Quito.
As well, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chávez and Morales, but also his chilian approval Michelle Bachelet.
The Guideline, which was held in the peace, was the observation mission of the United States Organization (OEA) on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The Constitutional draft focuses on the power of the State on Economy, preserving the "planification of development" of a country living mainly on the oil extraction by foreign companies and devises sent by its emigrants.
Corree, chosen in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the head of the State, which will be able to carry out up to two four-year consuasive mandates and will have the opportunity to solve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and would take a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of freedom of health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13,9 million residents, where 50% of the population live under poverty level.
It finally provides the prohibition of the presence of foreign groups, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorian base as a point of department of American antidrogue operations.
The 19 otages were released in Chad
A Egyptian command launched the assault against the ravisors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Caire.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captives for ten days in the wilderness were returned this Monday after midnight in the Egyptian capital.
On the morning, they were released by a Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently, the ships arrived at 15 hours a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military basis, accompanied by the International Airport of Cari.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to talk to the press, at the board of helicopters to Maadi's hospital, a residential campaign of Caire, to go up there.
They are in "good health" and "no ransom has been paid" to the ravisors, said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna, on the Tarmac.
Captured on 19 September at a safari in 4x4 at the foot of the Uanat Mount, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of otages had been cut off from a cache to the other by 35 inconvisors.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the manager of the Egyptian agency, safari organization.
A Egyptian security responsibility pointed out that 30 members of the special forces at board two helicopters had launched the ass in the night just before the wheel.
"A fire break exchange has occurred, and half of the ravisors have been killed, the others flee," said the responsibility required anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit were totally sent to Soudan, where they received support for German and Italian commands.
The leader of the Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and efficiency of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without more details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudan Army had said that he had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle at the border of which the ravisors, killing in six, including the Chef of Tchadjan, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a revolved group of Darfour, the Movement of Liberation of the Sudan Unit, (SLA-U), what this movement had immediately dismissed.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes manchettes and occupies this electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denie the amounts of misfortune that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological fo's or national history sites who are hungry?
What politicians will remind the Federal Government that he disregards his monuments and his patrimonial buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have real laws that actually preserve our inheritance?
Did you know that the French government dedicates three million and half euros to restore the only castle of China in the Valley of Loire?
In our neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the inheritance is part of the culture of the Americans and that this patrimoine must be protected by all citizens, all elections and all government departments, and that, in concertation.
In Quebec, at the Quebec History Society Federation, at least 40 000 volunteers in 211 historical, patrimoine, archives and genealogies are concerned about foeling the story, preserving with three under private archives and preserving archaeological clothes.
They are often the dogs of guard of our heritage, who protest with the energy of desperateness when promotors and decisions lay their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cimeters.
When, a court for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments nationalize a part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states come in aid to the Belgian-Holand bank, as the first European institution in the situation of distress after the snow-effect of the credit crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it, and the three countries support, at a sum of EUR 11,2 billion, this financial and assurance institution also placed in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Netherlands governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, by calling to the European Central Bank and to the responsibility for the competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first large crisis in the framework of the international financial crisis is more than one year for the Fortis bank.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy nearly half (49 per cent) of the bank capital in each country.
The bank will, without doubt, sell a part of its participation, among which, in the first place, activities, mainly insurance, have been acquired in the last year of the Netherlands ABN Amro.
The last week, Fortis's actions began a vertiginous fall. In the second half of the week, serious crisis signs have already been revealed at the bank.
The analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to the faillite.
Nothing on Friday, the actions of the company fell from 12 per cent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, more than two thirds of their value were lost.
Taking into account the current value of actions, the total value of the group's capital turns around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company leaders, is not real.
The direction of the company accuses the incertainty of the outer Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the American salvation plan of $700 billion, to be the origin of the fall of Fortis action.
Monday, papers have already benefited from an increased increase.
Friday, Philip Dierckx was appointed to the bank's head, as a new general director.
The financial liability was also seeking private purchasers, but it has not yet received a proposal on the fund.
Previously, the Belgian Government announced that investors would not be concerned, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the circle of the bank's customer and no agency was taken asylum.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A wheel in the powder
In America, living and health insurance companies often sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information on the purchase of medicines.
Experts in the protection of information fear that the data market becomes uncontrolled.
"The information on the prescription of medicinal products is available in any case in accordance with the agreement of the person concerned.
This type of program must be between independent hands, or it is again to grant its relief to a renard" - reminded Richard Dicket, the Creator of the program used to manage medicine prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance firms depend on the insurance premium and capital guaranteed in case of damage, the health status of the customer present, and if they believe that the risk is too large, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they knew the results.
Since ten years, Dick found a very lower procedure: from a number of identification, it is easily delivered to pharmacists, data on the purchases of personal medicines in the eight months. From that way, the programme determines the disease of the person and its health status.
For example, if this person regularly purchases high doses of cholesterol reductor, it refers to an extremely high blood grass rate, which is subsequently in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this programme are in employment, and some are determining at the same time a number of risks, so there is no greater thing to do to the assuranceer other than the papers. However, small problems can still be opened.
Among the challenges of this programme, it is found that a medicinal product can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against licatine or warm buffles, but may also be effective against depression.
This last is considered by the guarantees as an increasing risk factor, while the other, no.
Some companies developed in research and analysis of data, and they must ask the patient to collect the necessary information to the pharmacist.
They are then restricted by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctified for their missing throughout the past.
Since short, some companies have also treated the results of laboratorial analysis and have linked them to the data related to drug consumption, so they are able to provide a more precise portrait of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use becomes even more difficult.
There is a distinct law on the protection of medical data, but its field of action was only for practices and security.
A legislative proposal on the enlargement of the control circle of authorities in relation to specialized undertakings in the data supply is currently before the Congrès.
Dick Richard recognises that it is not enough and that it has developed more before its programme, which would condition the transmission of data to the agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question to know whether the person concerned is really free to grant or not its agreement, since if it is, the insurance does not sign a insurance contract with her.
Thus, and at the end of the time, the pools deepen the well-being of the breast.
The Global Menu of Marseille
The European Union and India multiplies their trade trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trade partners one to another, this theme also dominated the agenda of this nineth summit, in large part, by the other problems.
Today, there will also be a summary of France-Inde, where it will be particularly a matter of cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognised that India is a great democratic power to which it should give a larger right of speech in international matters, but the Member States have not yet agreed on their support in New Delhi for its candidate as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
In addition, they did not look too much on this issue, yesterday, at this nineth sum organized in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the leader of the diplomacy, Javier Solana, took the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with which they agreed that in five years they would have multiplied two trade trades, which means a good increase of a hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has passed from 25 billion to 55 billion, it does not seem to be too ambitious.
In this regard, they harmonised the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and thus air exchanges will also be able to take their responsibility in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union at the latest end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate negotiations.
The goal is to balance the situation with one side, the India, which is the first trade partner of the EU, and the other, New Delhi, which is only the nineth place of the EU partners.
The summet has dedicated attention to global matters.
The Afghanistan and Pakistanian situation was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency was to keep a United Nations conference on this subject.
The end of the trade cycle of Doha was also requested, although both had a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce at least twenty percent of its toxic rejections until 2020.
India was also agreed on this point, and with the fact that a global market should be passed during the climate conference in the next year, and to reduce the emission of gases on low effects from fifty per cent to 2050.
They would also like to prevent the increase in the prices of food goods, and supported the convocation of an international work meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Chief of India is today in the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, he is prepared to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian Atomic Reactors.
According to the information of the pressing agency, the agreement would take for 15 years.
In France, more than three hundred Italian editors
Fort presence of Italian editors in the International Library of Francfort.
More than three hundred Italian editors presented in the 60th edition of the Bookmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The International Room of the Frankfurt Book waits for this edition, more than 7 miles exponents from 101 different countries who will occupy the 17,790 square metres of the Room with more than 403 miles in exhibition, and Turkey as an invitation of honor.
This will be the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government during the inauguration ceremonie of Papillon Italy: In fact, Italy will be presented in institutional manner, with a Point of Italy-264 metres of exhibition space.
It will follow the meeting with the pressure in the Structur Room, papillon 5.0 of the Bookmesse: a opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the position of the Edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books is gradually decreasing in comparison to the total of Italian production, and in particular for adults and children.
I found Steve Fossett's airplane, the billioner disappeared a year ago.
The airport of Steve Fosset's airport, the billioner disappeared on 3 September 2007 while he fled on the wilderness of Nevada, was found.
The debris were found on a 3000 meters height plate, in the area of Sierra Nevada of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there is no human remaining.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, overcome the doubts that remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is good about the one on which Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he was missing," he said during a press conference.
The sheriff, therefore, stated that no human remaining was found either on the air or around.
In February , the billion of 63 years was considered dead .
The United States Transport Safety Bureau (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the epave repair, a team of candidates sent on the sites, identified the apparatus: it is well of Bellanca 8kcab, who disappeared on 3 September 2007, when Fosset collected from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from Nevada's border, some personal effects from Fosset were found by a couple around their apartment of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents with the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation of I.I.O.A., Spece and a pool.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billioner won a place in the history through a long series of records.
In the sixth temptation, he became the first man to complete the world's tour on an aircraft ballon: two weeks of solitaire flight.
Three years later, he had made the tour of the world flying and without scale.
Among these records, also the one who stole at 15.445 meters height, on the Andes, but with a childhood.
Glk, the publicity you don't have.
A 4x4 outside the commune of an original and well-defined design, on the marked lines, on the ample surfaces and net angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk, the lastborn of the "compacts" of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its outstanding, unexpected and unconventional contents will be the communication which will accompany the starting of 4x4 Glk, available in the showroom Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
Thus, the publicity that will accompany the beginning of the new car will take place to an unusual mode of communication, through a future 3D showing campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of max shows, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the milescope, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and through special lamps distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in real dimension and in tridimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that by looking at the picture, the car is out of the office.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8, the new Glk will be lightened, in all its details, to restore to a single image.
It is obvious that with this publicity, Mercedes is trying to introduce something again in the stereotypical area of car communication.
Will she succeed with this formula to highlight the interest of the future acquisitors? We will see it well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls who have been sorrowed by Italy now? They are part of the Ultras Italian group who followed the Italian national team for years, and who has never grown great problems until now.
He never had been hungry with the side effects.
The extract of the group is right.
Promotors come from Triveneto.
De Verone, Padoue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, there were small groups of Campania and Po·s.
They had three-color flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed to not be identified.
They're inspired of the English tifosery.
In Bulgaria, they found a fiosure of true nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian tifosi, 144 billets for the part: all nominatives, and so easily controlled.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who went to Sofia, no one had a current Daspo, no one had been prohibited to frequency a stage.
Four Italian tifios who had stage crime anticipations, did not have the right to the billet, and could not move.
Now the Viminal expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then will take measures: in this case, the tifios who are arrested or identified in the disords may purify a Daspo for at least five years.
A international Daspo prohibiting the frequency of the Italian stages, but also European stages.
Soon, our hooligans will not be putting up to the stage.
Good luck.
But now it's the time of fear-emulation: it's to say that Others are risked to take place in the first hundred fifty.
"We must straighten this incendie immediately, and do not stop who does so" supports the Viminal.
So, "keep well open eyes, especially for the match of the National Wednesday Team in Lecce"
In the Poês, there is actually a small puzzle of Ultras Italian supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meeting, on Thursday the Casms, who can even count on a section of the Aise, is secret services, which are rightly concerned with stage problems.
"The Duce-Duce cheers, and the arm tired during Mameli's hymne? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
This is the opinion (really uncomfortable) of Domenico Mazzi, director of the Observatory of Viminal (he took Francesco Tagliente post and then Felice Ferlizzi).
MazziProperty was previously preached in Trieste, where a Ultras Italian group's supporters' node was founded in 2002.
It is true, as said Mazzi日, that in Bulgaria Louer Mussolini is not a crime, but it is sure the behavior of these 150-200 tifosis has been honest.
"I am not a sociologist - the No. 1 of the Observatory - crimes must be assigned in the country where the fact occurs.
Until now, this group remained in the rules, we will now see what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the syfflets against Mameli's hymne: those are not crimes, but if you allow me, they're not polite..."
