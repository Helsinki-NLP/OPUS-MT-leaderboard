What do you mean? The CSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the pastlery
The new concepts of the CSSD in the capital will have to exceed, it seems, evident language barriers so that the components of the Board of Prague and the municipal Council understand their newly renewed partners of the ODS.
The currently.ch "examinated" to the members of the new Council of the CSSD to check their knowledge of the slang language that has occurred in the Council in the last years when the current members of the coalition governed Prague.
The encoding dictionary that used Prague's flower and political birth during the previous period, of Master Pavel Bém, includes some of the most known persons, Propertyations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisely, new concepts almost do not understand those known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I don't know."
"Better I am a new in the praguense policy," he dealt with during the "collegeo" termology review of the Lukas Kaucky culture concept.
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Brezina was equal.
Maybe you know the concept of golf.
"It may be the only expression of all you asked me what you used at times."
"If not, usually don't work slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the period Currently.which last June before the ODS voting convention, the editing chose six examples, in particular those who are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "better golf box of Prague", "and to the pastlery", "tower knife", "capital traition" and "blindar".
Three concepts accepted the test and a quarter, Antonin Weinert, which in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, at first accepted, but didn't take the phone again.
The fifth conceal, Peter Dolininek, refused to do that right.
"I don't care about these things and I don't think of how the democratic civilians divorced."
"What I need is how we will understand in the implementation of our programmes," he noted.
As it was seen, the concept of Lukas Kaucky would not have realized that the previous title was an expression on a business influent and a friend of the exalcalde Bém, Roman Janoušek.
A Kaucky the word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything; the only term he confirmed in the examination is "the largest golf board of Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, who immediately adds, "but I know more about the news."
"I'll have to point to a language course," she brome.
Karel Brézina is not the only person who recognises the tonnel Blanka, but also the conceal of Medium Environment Lukas Plachý.
Then, both sociodemocrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachý even know where to find that person; also, it underscores the meaning of "Go to the pastlery".
"I think it's meaning to go to a Prague company; it's soon opened to Plachý that is the company's seat of Janoušek.
Like Brisbane, such knowledge has received them from the news, but it does not use such vocabulary.
Participants in the test are being tested, among sociodemocrats there is no such family glossary of coloquial terms.
"I asked my companions, but it really seems we have nothing like it."
"But, we use apodos, sometimes abreviations or make words games with names," says the Chairman of the CSSD, Petr Hulininský, whose party companions call Hulda.
"In the college, I was called Bizza, but I don't know if my companions also call me like this," he confessed his own Karel Brezina appetite.
The newspaper Currently.ch tested the name and worked.
For your partners of party, Weinert is Dèda (like "yayo") or, less friendly, Dédek ("life"), representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they were associated before the engaging elections during the party's patrocinium, it receives the apodo of "Graček" ("playmobil") by some of its companions.
Apodos are also the only expressions that sociodemocrats tolerate in the talk inside the party.
Hulininsky doesn't like you lamen Hulda, but the newspaper currently.cz discovered even other apodos for this president.
"The doctor of the rights of the porrs" seems to be reminded that Petr Hulininský received his doctorate in the right of the Bratislava police.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "brows", published in a brochure
Women considered as bridges in Burkina Faso are certain characteristics.
They like to have a grown age, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
Women who "return" brushes are sent to a zone here, so that they don't hurt the rest of the people.
"The men rarely suffer that way."
"It is also not anxious to healthy young women, because they help in works and have children," explains a monster that, in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso is occupied in a special residence of more than hundred women exhausted from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this "social measure".
He issued an informative brochure that should contribute to avoiding brush feedback.
However, this has a piece.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso doesn't know read," warns the journal Die Standard on the deficiencies of the written employment.
Bridge accusations are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighborhood of Burkina Faso, the last week Ammy Hemmah died, 72 years old, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors have been debt to a deceased few circumstances.
The woman was taken into the oil used for ritual units.
He was arrested when the group wanted to "excuse the bad spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "brows" supports people at all levels of education.
The journal Der Standard quoted a 42-year businessman in Burkina Faso: "The human mass consumers have always represented a danger," he admired.
While in Burkina Faso, the Government was still involved in her in the past year, the president still participated in her.
"The President Jammeh, after his grandmother's death, lan't a wide jazz of the brushes that, probably, had been related to his death and had killed the president by the black magic."
"To help you, he brought calls from near Guinea that, protected by police, military and personal listening of the President, were brought to the force of men and women chosen at the time among the peoples of the president in Kanilai," reported the International Amnistia Organization in its report.
In the finger, arrested people had to drink a pound of herbs with alucinogeneous effects that also caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested were not on the station in the finch.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detained people.
Bakala's inquiry: he's warm with carbone staff and signs a higher cup
The man, advanced and recent age, cross the doors of the attention centre to the client of the RPG Byty company of Zdeňek Bakala's "magnate of carbon", the largest private owner of stakeholders in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm, there were documents with the new contracts of three steps: his, his daughter, and his son, who is in compliance with the judgment.
The three just pilled the liberalisation of the acquirers.
Instead of 3.500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from the next year 4.100 crowns for a stage of two stages with separate kitchen from second category.
"Besides, there is no warm water and the calamity is based on a calder of solid fuel," shows the man with his finger in the new contract of his son, on which the signature has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains the middle, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which qualified the new conditions of achieving as "incorrect and innocent", recommends the inquiryers who do not sign the new contracts and who wait until 7 December, the date in which a guide will be published to inform how to act in these cases.
But in front of this, the man just makes a damn.
"Everything says something," he says with bad face.
Ostrava is converting into a large range of liberalisation tests.
After the New Year, the majority of the steps that, in the Czech Republic, were until the time under a regulated acquirer.
Therefore, currently.ch was decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG Mineral Wait Room is one of the four of Ostrava and, on Tuesday at the nine, was already filled.
Just next to the doors are the security guards and a machine to collect number.
"Alquiler 2011" can be read on a button of your taktil screen.
When pressing it, get out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost doesn't give time or read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen held at the top of the room.
In a second, you're at school.
Shortly later, a advanced age marriage comes to ask, but the multitude of the room is not here for the new winners.
Most people are going to solve usual problems, such as anciently: applications for arrangements, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with new accommodation contracts will come to Ostrava to the inquiry buzones of most of the 44,000 stages of RPG around the middle of November.
RPG Byty offers them in letters an increase in the winner between 15 and 38%.
On 18 November, a special window is opened in the customer's attention centre for new winners.
"It's working a week, so it's starting," they replied, after a short doubt, the workers who are in it when the client is present as a journalist.
Liberalisation and ancient stages for miners in Bakala are the most delicate issues in the area.
Before the elections, the Parliament's president, originating in Ostrava, Lubomir Zaorálek, of the CSSD, has already treated them highly and clearly, and they are now present in the periods of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new ground."
"They haven't changed me the fucking silver of the bathroom," the man mentioned in the introduction is disappointed.
Workers are disabled, for the moment they come more than anything jubilated to check if they receive a discharge in the acquirer if they sign at time, as the special RPG offer promises.
They will also receive the half of the disregard on the February acquisition of the rest of the inquiry signing the new contract before 15 December.
However, the mineral "free-liberalisation" window will certainly not be able to discipline the avalanch of doubts.
"On 360 clients who were here yesterday, they only asked for the rental in 2011 about 40 or fifty people," recalls the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, the RPG proposes on the web and on its tables to conduct individual meetings on contracts, where necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the acquisition, an independent judge must resolve the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way of conducting possible and completely in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"This is not going to judge anyone," one of RPG Byty employees and a man who is on the street before the customer's attention center gives at least in part the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13.000, and I remain 5.000 for food; I don't have any means to access the courts."
But immediately the employee seems the doubt.
"We'll see it."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the means that they do not sign, so people may expect," he says.
The acquisition regulation will stop to exist in the majority of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, if RPG Byty, its increase is a economic need.
"The current accommodations are not yet covering the quantities necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," replies Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty residential portfolio, which adds that the disturbance of the state of the Community's foundation of the inquiry is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the accommodation.
While during the five years that have passed between 2005 and 2010, the RPG could invest in 4 billion apartments, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014, the number will increase to 5.200 million.
The big screen that covers the tissue, before the seats of the wait room, now repeats some data that highlight in red.
"The increase in the rent in 2011 to 15% and less is applied to 31.200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be as maximum 7.50 cheese corns menes per square meter," it is indicated on the screen.
Only increasing in 38% the 400 degrees of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low quantities, of 19.66 corns per squared meter," indicates RPG.
In 2.600 feet, the winner will remain unable for the next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not affect the acquirers, but it will be scaled between four to eight years.
Furthermore, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rental (see the graph) again in the stages, mainly in warming: new windows and calamity.
They will have priority to those who sign the outcome agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need guardian
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the Arch.Design company.
No one would say that he also hides a small guardy inside of it with all the same installations: walls of colors, creative mobiles and even a miniature park on the outer terrace.
Since October of the past year, the children of the Arch.Design employees can come to her.
The Arch.Design architectural project company, from which many known buildings came from Brno, thought from the first buckets of the Aviopoint building included a space for its mini-guardian.
In the company they work about 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom, and they wanted to allow architects and delineants to return to work quickly after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced time, the guardy is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to its workers in the framework of its social programme.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility of combining a needed professional with children's care.
The Ministry was a idea of the workers of Arch.Designu, and, with the support of the direction, the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs were financed.
The Ministry of the Company is funded by the European Social Fund in the framework of the Operating Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the granted financing (a dotation of more than 2,8 million Czech Crowns) were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, qualified personal contracts and services.
When exhausting financing (two years), Arch.Design has the obligation to maintain the mini-guardian with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project was a year and in the presentation of the financial application contributed to the Economy Rating company.
Children's attention is in the hands of qualified staff, and they are present all day for their care, a teacher and a teacher of the Ministry of Education. The guardian currently accepts children without age, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it's a "miniguardy", it can only be attached to a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with turns they come more during the day.
The work of the guard is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the guardian, independently from the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is a individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guard programme are comparable to the regular pre-school education programme.
In it children play not only, but also receive a quality teaching: from basic education to school preparation, they learn to English.
The class has not only games and table games but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the own company create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of getting children late when they are far from their workplace.
So parents are more productive when they work.
It is not surprising that this generes naturally a relationship of loyalty between the worker and its employer.
Thus, Arch.Design is situated among companies signing that they offer a great benefit for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, finally, this programme reforces the marketing of staff.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Note Gaudí's interiors
The tissue seems to be the loom of a prehistoric ladder, the scales reorder the column of a dinosaur and the balcones seem to be the mouth of a open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catholic architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its similar form to a squelet, the locals put it "the house of the bones".
Their organic forms, their calling colors, the new use of the stone, the fractions of blue and mosaic, a fashion that corresponds to the scales and all representatives quietly curved lines, all of this is typical of the section of Antoni Gaudí.
The carrying of the house plays with onic lines, delicate colors and textures out of nature and fauna.
More attention, a certain geometry, ritm and a carefully thought order is observed.
On the night, the whole fashion of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illustrated in such a way that the colors are improved.
The serpent and the torsion of the forms continue to surprise us also inside it.
The wounded wood copys the window frames, the bars, the gates, the mirrors and the letters.
The Casa Batlló, located in the campaign of EÂmple at the number 43 of the animated trade street of Passeig de Gracia, came from the remodelation of a house in 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction was two years old and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the industrial rica Josep Batllou, urged initially to cut down the previous building and start from zero, but immediately accepted Gaudi's idea of performing a new and faster reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, formated by various apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudi alone.
Josep Mary Jujol worked in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project, the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the façad.
In the fashion also workers of other creators and artists.
Cooperation in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of the successful cooperation of Jujol with Gaudi.
Jujul participated in the building of the House of Milá and the Güell de Gaudí park, where other parts of it are located.
Because of its organic form, the locals lately after their finalization entered it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism for opening windows, began to call it "the house of boasts".
It is also said that, on the top of the building, the spade of San Jorge, the pattern of Catalunya appears.
Other cultural elements of the building hide religious reasons.
Gaudi projected in the house a single system for the central calamity time with ventilation respirators and typical chemicals.
You can be surprised by your inclination of 40 and five degrees.
Construction, Gaudi did not absolutely respect the construction standards of the time and was not allowed to be influenced by them.
However, the construction received the appropriate authorisation from the beginning, although the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, after its conclusion, the adhesion was so affected by the result that it requested to be corrected.
He, for example, hurted him that the building includes columns even until the public ace.
The arrangements have never been made, rather than at the contrary: only fifty days after the request of the assembly, Joseph Batlló requested (and received) permission to reach the two highest stages of the building.
The owner was installed in the lower stages.
In the gallery of the second stage, the room and the private part of the apartment were located in the room and in the third stage.
The low plant reached a game.
The house, from six feet, is completely overtaken by a scale that leads to the terrace of the tissue.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all right angles and lines, covering them from curved walls.
Gaudi also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common party can be connected completely by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can be communicated in this way without rejecting the privacy necessary for more intense conversations.
The house, with Gaudi's reconstruction, was not only obtained a new fashion but also a inu and two additional steps.
It is also impressive how Gaudi plays with the light, white blue and to the covering of the internal patio and tragaluses.
The game with the two colours brings the maximum light in all the stages of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that the white reflects more light than dark colors, which, in contrast, absorb sun rays.
What person can visit the Batlló House, which was added to the World Heritage list of the Unesco Humanity in 2005.
In the first stage of the house, the most space and the most reloaded apartment of the public is located.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the creator's birth.
With visits, they confirmed, or discovered, that it was a very beneficial business and extended visits to the common area and to the buhardilla, including the terrace of the tissue.
The price of the income to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16,50 euros, although students, jubilants and holders of tourist cards have 20% discounts.
The above amount considers the price of the entrance of other Gaudi constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real environment of the bed with your lagart tours, you should make a friend quickly of some resident in the neighborhoods and visit you home.
How choosing the colch and summer: Women and men are looking for different things
No of a pompous frame for the bed; what actually trusts his quality to a good bed is the surface to bubble, namely, the cocktail and the soir.
First of all, they must be supplemented to the perfection in order to adapt themselves to concrete users.
Election is playing many elements, including weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
It also results important for the type of inner in which the colchon and the summer are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a week-end cabine that doesn't seem to have calamity, we should not use latex cups because they "slowly" are used.
Moreover, they are able to consider more than normal polyuretan colchons.
Therefore, it is necessary to give them the more frequent flight.
If the center's channels are not suitablely flying and, above, they are on a firm basis, they keep inside the humidity. It can even appear lower.
At the time of choosing a bed, they also affect the habits.
Whoever has spent a long time in the foreigner, often uses a very high cockpit with a mixed layer and has problems to feel well on a lower and hard surface.
"Almost all hokey players who returned from NHL were deceived that they didn't sleep like well here."
"For their masked worms, tails and chairs, they needed cows with a mixed beach of viscoelistics."
"This type of colchons are also recommended for people with diabetes who are troubled by the nervous system, so they receive the information of articulations and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, which is specialised in the mobility acquired.
Many hokey players, like other clients, have time to predict viskoelistic collars.
"There is no problem now, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech Mark Tropico."
There is no need to be a NHL player anymore to be able to handle viscoeletic.
This "wonderful" works in a very simple way.
Optimize your heat and form depending on the absorbed heat or adapt to its body heat.
Nothing exercises pressure; during the night, he will not turn away as after a hard game.
Simplely, if I sleep better.
Viscoelestatic also works as a protection against flags.
When you choose the size of the cup, add to its height the length of your feet, namely, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a layer between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room of 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, such as solters, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
That a possible visit may also be comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: when you get the mouth up, you should have the hands comfortablely encountered to the codes," advises the Engineer Helena Prokopová, expert of Cechu chalouníku to decorators, which has been occupied for many years from the healthy dream problem and the mobile enemy, which is discussed in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, everyone needs his own summer and colchon, so during the purchase you need to give attention to combine the height of the cocktails.
In contrast, it will be necessary to mount summers at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Spum cools should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with inside of wheels at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that is adapted to forms and weight.
"When you touch it with your hand, or when you get in the cup, you must certainly not be noted by the mullers," he advises Helena Prokopová.
Each colch re-reags a specific type of sound.
The rooms completely covered, where the colchon and the base are like simes, have no sense in the room.
The colds breathe badly and can't lay their back, which today is often done.
And, since we transpired each night between 0.2 and 0.75 l sugar, it is clear that after about five or seven years the colchon will begin to remember a large (and congestioned) tamiz.
For this reason, the specialists are speaking of a life of up to 25 years of life or, even, of a life guarantee.
However, everything has one butt.
Therefore, sellers give a advice: in the rocks with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully carefully about the lavage and the lavage of the background, but better add a cup protector that can easily be removed and laid.
Although currently cremallers are locked in their whole perimeter, then when opening them, they remain in two parts (a very important thing for lavado and lava size!), their manipulation in larger size models (and by one person) when the colchon is raised may seem to be a fight between a mosca and a weight of weight.
In the bed, instead of a sommer, have you a firm table?
Never!
As much for beds thought to pass visits a night.
However, it must be made (if you do not have them) ventilation orries in the table and should be used with a cockpit with female inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with bottles in balls (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a mixed layer.
Polyuretan colchons should not be used on such basis.
For non-arculable laminas and containing between 14 and 18 laminas, latex or sandwich colochons can be used (e.g. a combination of latex and coco fibres), although it is always better a somer with a larger number of laminas, 28 or more, where the lamps of the lumbar area are strengthened and can be regulared.
Smileys of articulable lamines should not be used with a cup of wheels, as it does not react to the reclination.
Besides the adjustment of the rigidity of the lambs, the protection of the stomach can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the lambs that allows pressure or, even, to inclinate the lambs so that "rode" perfectly to the lambs during the dream.
For men who have very wide spots, it's something very important.
They even agreed with the cocktail manufacturers who, in the "masters", began to use a more mixed area right around the bottles.
They also agree with women, for which they put a more mixed area back to the chairs.
For the most required clients, there are sleeps with → in cross or tables with the called multitorsion amortiguation.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the pressure is reduced.
Take also into account that, although it uses the cocktail and sounds suitable, if it uses a bad holiday (green and "mullida"), the majority of the benefits will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the holiday must support the head and it is possible only to reach the hobbys so that the muscles of them can be relaxed.
The appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Escandinavia.
When the hole is thrown on the side, the hole must be at the same level (when it combines with the dream with refrigerator for hobbys or the most mixed area of the colchon) as the height of the hobby.
Modern cocktails have something to see, it seems, with the original pigs filled.
Manufacturers are still using natural materials or at least mixed.
In fact, the biological colchons are moderate.
The primary materials based on petroleum, with which the polyuretan espuma is produced, are filled with natural oil, such as ricin or soja.
In fact, nearly all known manufacturers use soja.
"Biological, in the case of colchons, means that the centre is only produced from natural origin materials," explains Petr Vašíček of the Tropico Plus company.
In addition, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the foundation of the colchons, one of the first true aloe.
But it can also be chosen by microcapsules, which free a fresh aroma to boss or lavand.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetables of brises, so that the foundation of the colchon absorbs the warmness and refreshers the body, women prefer "calent" the foundation.
Red pitch extracte improves the blooding, so women feel more calamity.
The favorites now?
Cools manufactured of cold espum, which are more poor, with a → adapted cells, which makes them more permeable than normal polyuretan and offers more permeasibility.
The combination of various frozen and viskoleastic smokes allows the manufacture of colchons of various areas that are perfectly aware of where the head, the hobbys and the tanks go.
A good-quality cup will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who exercise a therapeutic function are supposed to have a lower IVA, since they are considered as healthy means.
The first benefit in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to wear in the rocks and dreams.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers may be approved, which sometimes offer two cups for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex mark offers Duofre colchons with a spume with memory memory by 11.990 corners.
The second gets free.
The era of the viskoleastic with a open cell cell and a great density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
Initially, it appeared as a material for NASA, because during the dishes, astronautes were seen subject to a huge overload.
The time is covered with heat and endures with cold.
Therefore, the human body, calm, exercises a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid the occurrence of plagues, even though it is also to improve comfort during the dream.
The viscoelistic espuma is not only used in the colchons, but also for health products, for example for holidays that are placed under the feet and alivian, as well as their holding.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar.
More parents use people's monitoring devices to control their children
The fear of children brings more people to think of controling them by GPS.
The system, originally thought for the monitoring of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and contribute, for example, in cases of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device has the relative size of a grid box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people feared the case of the disappeared Anička and began to inform about the media available to protect your children better.
Even the side of invading your privacy.
"We all say that it is not to spy, but another means to reduce the possibilities of a tragedy," Peter Pilin of the Macro Weil Company, one of the providers of monitoring devices on the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, you can abuse such devices, for example, if you put in the bottle of someone without knowledge, but we have not yet touched such cases."
"The majority of customers actually buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know why the "cajita" serves and how it is used in case of emergency.
Infantil psychologist Dana Bočkova warns about the fact that if the child doesn't want to take it, he's just gonna take it.
"Including the smallest children show great creativity at the time of intentionally certain things if they want to avoid controlling them."
"Earlier, parents trusted greatly in the mobile, but these could be removed as easy as the monitoring device," -- Bočkova.
In your opinion, it is debatable if in the case of an attack such device is really useful.
"If it's a prepared square, the author will almost always check if the child has some kind of electronic device that can discover its location."
"This is the phone now."
"The use of monitoring devices will be extended, and it will also search for them, since their sale will certainly be performed with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always take a step before the police," says psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedofil.
It is Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring Company, which provides monitoring services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the monitoring device is destroyed immediately, your presence can serve as aid.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a specified period."
"If it suffers damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most dear devices are integrated with a inclination measurement, so if the person simply is rebuilt and remains inmotive, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position concerned," Ê Czech.
In your opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, where only a special software should be installed.
The problem of current monitoring units is that it is currently being devices with a similar size to a cell box or smaller size mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be.
If Pilin de Macro Weil is, then tests are currently performed with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added benefit that a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
"It identifies it after a certain time, which can make the police win time," adds.
Although the monitoring devices are carried out in the moon or covering, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle monitoring.
This is the test of the position with a GPS system (used in the normal navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mechases as to round all Chequia. But they're only two years old.
The Czech Army bought 445 miles of mecha to take explosives.
Last year, the Defence Minister added to his arsenal 224 miles of mixture.
Therefore, they have existence for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the mecha is two years, four to the sum.
The army bought the mechanism for explosives to the STV Group, etc. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff responded to MF DNES, justifiing the purchase of such a large quantity of mechases, saying that soldiers need for training hands of 60 miles per year.
However, the calculations of the army pirotics, with which the MF DNES has been contacted, are determined that, in such cases, these handbooks should be carried out with frequency use of explosives each year, too, all the generals, high-command officers, and even secretariats and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They didn't want exemptions nor the Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Captain of Vlastimil Picek.
Only this could be justified that the military costs sixty miles of mixture.
That length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient existence for more than ten years.
If, in contrast, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional coming with a maximum of two meters of mixture, the army would have the new purchase (additioning the consumption of engineers or special units) sufficient existence for the 225 above.
The soldiers of the quick intervention brigade have been personally lacked in front of Minister Vondra because they say they have only a munition for various weapons, so they are limited even the trading practices for money.
And we don't talk about the lack of inner clothes.
"I don't even understand that they understand us repeatedly such quantities of mixture."
"But it's your decision, and they'll certainly know why they do so."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom, as a company, we are satisfied," admits the STV Group's commercial director, Jan Decky.
The carrier of the Defense Minister Jan Pejšek determines the hundreds of miles of mecha, also saying that there will be existences of this "munity" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Decky, from STV Group, indicates that the mixing has only a useful life of four years and, in the case of pirotical products for the army or police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can dure up to four," says one of the soldiers who, for the possible critics of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of his useful life, every munition must be checked carefully to see if it is still reliable and will not hurt soldiers.
But these tests are not free and re-reserve an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 miles of mixture, it has been discounted.
"We were covered by 60% less than the request for the last year of 244 miles," indicates the Pejšek portfolio from the Defence Minister's Buy Centre.
Only to compare: the annual mix consumption of police pirotics, which eliminate the municipality of the Second World War or leaved by the Soviet Army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters ago.
Furthermore, the police always asks just the just amount to exhaust the munition before the end of its useful life.
It was decided for security reasons for pirotics and, in addition, as long as more modern and reliable mixture types can be achieved.
The Ministry has already clear difficulties to end decades of thousands of tonnes of munition from the time of Varsovia, when the Checoslovakian army of two hundred thousand people was prepared for a campaign in the Rin.
The pyrotechnics with whom MF DNAS spoke, after a few years the following problem will occur with the present: it will be to remove hundreds of miles of old mixture, which is now buying "barata".
I still live from the contacts I received thanks to the concurrence
The fact of wining the "Empire of the Year" concurrence helped Luka Pytloun to sell the franquises of his hotel.
The last and age, he won the "Empire of the Year" competitor of 28 years, Lukas Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story seems to know about a movie.
And Luke Pytloun just enjoyed traveling.
In the foreigner, it was noted that Liberec had lack of quality accommodation to good price.
With the holidays he meet with stational work in the foreign and a credit of the chair bought a house that was a half-fem stage composition.
Having taken into account that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really courageous.
"Now, the quality-prise relationship of the apartment in our area has encouraged me to do something about it," says Luka Pytloun.
Before achieving the first stage rebuilt for foreign workers.
All the income that had received the investment again in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he was able to open four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of approximately 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of everyone was, even a few years ago, the four-star design hotel of Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we sold our concept of franquisy, and others show interest in a Pytloun franquisy," said the businessman number one of the last year.
"To this sale of licences for the opening of hotels, the fact of winning the concurrence of the Year Empire," adds thankful Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surroundings.
"The people recognized me in the street, still felt me often, and I must say that it was very pleasant," recalls.
Of course, he recommends all the world that he wants to hold any company to participate in the concurrence.
But it believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
Ask that it still lives from contacts and knowns that, without the concurrence, may not have been obtained.
"To some people I knew thanks to the concurrence, I began to cooperate usually."
The fame associated with success, in its opinion, included also employees,
totally about seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and they are proud to participate in something that obtained the general recognition."
"It's not my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of all the team."
"Only that is my name which appears in the first place," says Luka Pytloun modestyly today.
My successor wants a more quiet year than we had in Farmet
Euphoria for the victory was soon divorced by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is likely that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Ždárský, received the first premium in the last and § of the Concurrence of Vodafone "Annual Company", last year in the "Slave House" of Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he could convert a small technical taller to Cheska Skalice to a signature with a volume of hundreds of million businesses.
"I can say that the premium has not only encouraged me, but to all my partners and improved our confidence to fight competition," says the winner of the last year.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Ždárský's father to win a small taller as compensation for the immigration of properties during the communism, he did not doubt too much; he rejected his job in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of companions, found the company with his father of plastic pills.
Shortly later, they began to specialize in vegetal oil pressures.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic pressure in the centre of Europe.
They also received a greater presence between the non-specialized public after the success of the concurrence in the media.
"Not only our customers began to consider the Farmet mark as well as that foreign partners also began to appreciate the cooperation with a company that had a greater success in their country," says Karel Žzhárský.
Last year may not have been in Farmet just a sample of the euphoria of the victory.
He also received recognition for commercial results until 2008 and, partly, of 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the hardest year for the sale of my ownria.
The enhancement of the crisis, which has not yet reached such citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, obviously, don't even deliver us from such a situation."
"The incomes were reduced to 40%, we had to limit production and even had some exhibitions," explains Karel Žjárský.
A sustainable undertaking should sometimes even take shortly popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the benefits of the company, although it was at lower level than before the crisis.
However, where Farmet did not cover expenditure was in research and development.
"We have built a research and training center with subventions, strengthening the presence in the international market and obtaining great values in national feritages," says Žjárský.
Everything indicates that they've already left the crisis behind.
The income again increases and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to have a sense of victory, but in a more quiet atmosphere," says Karel Ždárský.
A question that shows ridicule standards
The survey of Absurdez of the year is part of the business tournament for four times.
You've already been able to remove some ridiculous standards.
The unknown winner of the new and investigation Absurdez of the year was the obligation of bringing documents to the administration to which officers could be online.
The decision adopted more than one third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extraction from the market register, although its officers can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer request an extract of the market register when it performs a control of the taxes of the insurance," stated the Porter of ChSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the year Absurdez question is to consult the rules and regulations to be respected by companies and businesses in Czechland and to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year forms a fourth part of the business tourneo of the Hospodářský noviny publication and begins to create an affection between the general public.
While the e° of the past year has been involved in the participation of three thousand voters, this year is practically reached by the four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have various legal obligations of surface that must be respected simply to trade.
"It may be in the number of papers necessary for the statement of taxes we are first in the world," comments Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Media Enterprises and Employers of the Czech Republic.
Since years ago, simplification of business standards is a declared goal of all governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement particularly in the Czech Republic.
The World Bank, from the view of the conditions for a company, is located in the 74th position, which is eight lower places than last year.
The concurrence of Absurdez of the year was first celebrated in 2006 and each year repeated in the same way.
What may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and September, when the concurrence is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the complainant chooses seven candidates for the "antipremium" and, in October, allows the public to vote on the Internet to www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity he receives more votes.
For the investigation of this year, more than hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that have no meaning.
The examples were sent to both business and professional and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the concurrence, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and carriers pay the peaje or that twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms pink the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals of this year is published on the pages of the concurrence.
The announcement of the concurrence, which is always performed at the beginning of November at the Place of Wenceslao de Praga, is part of an event in which they are intended to participate in the political and social world.
This year, for example, they attended this Act of the Competition of Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Median Companys of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Company Chamber of the Republic.
"The economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continues to work for businessmen, therefore my goal is to eliminate a minimum of 30 paragraphs that are currently unnecessaryly complicating trade," announced the Ministry of Industrie and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
The efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in water of borrowing.
In 2007, the most inquired for people was the commitment of the employee to communicate with an antelation of three days to the business office of the permanent functioning area, the purpose of reaching with a place to a ferry or exposure.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that I completed secondly in the number of votes in 2007, meaning that the communication to the work office by its foreign workers from working journeys of up to 30 days was deleted in the Law of the Green Card.
And the third is going to win her.
Absurdez in 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapeutes to have a great speed, a neck and two ground bases in their consultation.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to provide a nearby.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The newness in this fifth and fourth concurrence of Hospodářský noviny is the category called Empresa responsible for 2010.
The commitment of this concurrence consists of supporting responsible and justified companies.
"In this way, we want to support companies who are involved in the impact of their environmental activity and who support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organizer and patrocinator of the concurrence, as in the case of the concurrence of the Rebeld of the year.
For this new special subcategorie of the year and this year of Vodafone Enterprise's main concurrence in 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities were completely different between one and another, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is, for example, related to non-supported persons, in other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of the whole Republic, for example, it was a pleasant company of Et Netera software, which supports the training of informal sport equipment between their workers, which then participate in tours of various sports.
Another example of company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has already been seven years old as the main fund supplier to patrocinate children incapacity.
In Podebrad, there is a paper that is particularly concerned about the health problems of their workers, since they are more than 70 per cent of the model; therefore, it received the title of the Company responsible from the central area of Chequia and the Vodafone Empresa concurrence of the year ended third place in the region.
In Olomo-- wins the MiRyz Soft accountability company, which reduced the working hour, even under the average of 35 weekly hours, without reducing the salaries.
The title was also authorised because it purchased the Czech manufacturers priorityly, supported Community activities in the area and respected the environment.
"We are trying to restore the maximum possible in order that our production and administration activities produce the less possible impact on the environment," explains Milushe Ryznarová.
The responsible TI Enlogit company of the Usti region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each computer, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboard; also supports the job from home and in its business events using the catering services of a local protected company.
"We also support the Beca Persona in appeals, which is particularly helping the local Roman community," comments the representative of the company Ondréj Suchý.
The company of Prani's Prani's purchasing from Karlovy Vary's region, whose employees receive bonifications in a special way that affect their pension funds.
"We give advantages in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and ocio," says Joseph Straècz, from the building company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the region of Moravia-Silesia.
In the year responsible enterprise category, it was automatically designed to all regional finalists of the Vodafone Business concurrence of the year that responded to the issues of the registration formula and sent it to the organisations before 15 August.
Organizators removed from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of the competitive companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the complaint of the business responsible for the year, but they were not disqualified from the "principal" Vodafone Empresa of the year."
"Independent candidatures for this concurrence are not allowed, since it is a subcategorie of the main complaint for the Year," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose adviser.
The police made arrests during a public substance in the building of the Agricultural Fund in Pilsen
The police against corruption has made several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in the last days.
The detectives married a local company in the media sector and the immobiliary company Luboš G.
It seems that this is trying to manipulate a current public substance for the refund of the rights so that the substained area would receive a precise interested person.
I'd have to pay for that to Luboš G. half million crowns.
"For this moment, I can only say that the police look for a person for a suborn during a public undertaking and public invitation," said Pravo the head of the general fiscal of Pilsen Antonie Zelena, adding that at the moment he can't make more details about the current research.
After twenty-four hours, the police sold 46-year business officer.
About how it could influence the public substance, given the few official information, it can only be speculated.
The Porter of the Agricultural Fund Lubomira Churna answered Pravo's questions saying that the police had actually been arrested in Pilsen's seat and went during a public substance.
"This is a customer, not one of our workers," he needed.
See Blackna, the public subasta is called "Convocatory for the presentation of proposals for land transfer in accordance with the Law on Earth" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the offered land.
"These people, during the convocation, offer a higher value than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the offers, the order of the purchasers is determined and, then, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the greatest offer" explained the Fund's carrier.
Luboš G. had information about who was to be presented to the convocation and, as he at the same time was interested because he bought several refund rights, proposed the interested in the area that would not participate in the subasta.
Please, it was covering a committee.
This would explain that at the time of arrest, it had so much money over.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund since ago.
He figured in the cause of the former leader of the PF Václav Sankot, which was accused of dismissing the substitution of lands for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. just received from the Fund some lands for the construction of public infrastructure, especially in the place where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borska pole.
Then he changed them in a very beneficial way with the judge by a house in the historical centre of the city with a very higher value.
In this case, the meeting had to intervene because, in contrast, the blocked areas would avoid construction.
The families shall pay additional expenditure of several hundred coroners per month
Homes will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and electricity, extensions by calamity and, in some cases, greater accommodations.
Therefore, the families will have to get out of the portfolio from January, several hundreds of crowns per month more than now.
The electricity price increases by 4.6%, the gas around 2%, in some cities, must be paid up to 10% more for water supply, and many also increase the price of central calamity.
The upspring of electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns more a year than now.
However, the main electricity providers reduced prices because it has increased support for renewable source production, particularly photography.
However, gas is moderately concerned, especially when heat is more used and therefore is more consumption.
In this case, they should also have a few hundred more coroners per year.
While electricity and gas are undertaken throughout the country, the price change of central calamity varied from one to another.
The price upspring is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the households of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January for the central calamity about 50 crowns more per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1.000 additional crowns per year.
The residents in Prague should also support a increase of 9% of the water price and calamity, especially if the city increases the infrastructure acquisition.
If the winner doesn't vary, the prices will pay 6.8% extra.
However, prices in Prague will continue to be among the lowest in the country.
In the north of Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest, both rates will be charged by 7.4%.
The prices of the acquirer of 450,000 stages in Prague can be increased, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which is located in Usti nad Labem, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company shall bring the courts to those who are not in accordance with the new acquisition.
Regular acquirers, which benefit the residents of about 300,000 feet, could increase the year coming to 10%.
Young Czechs are drunk with Fernet and Ron. The beer is no longer, because it makes slow effect
Fernet, rock, wodka and even good whiskys stolen to their parents.
These are the drinks that cause them to end in young drinking care with a less than fifty years of age.
Children who are thrown in the hospital permanently to overcome the race are no more.
This results from the experience of doctors who are in such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Be drinking or wine is no longer mode, because they're late to drink them."
"Now the mode is the strong alcoholic drinks," indicates Pravo the Chief of the Hospital Hořo in the centre of Bohemia, Ludék Pelikán.
"When you get to take a bottle to your father from the alacena, you can be whisky, but usually it's about Fernet and wodka."
"The wodka has the advantage of becoming awesome and that he doesn't hurt so much," explains.
It also confirms the Porter of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's about Fernet or Ron."
"These are modern alcoholic drinks, especially among schools."
"In some cases, they use waiting to get home," adds Jurinová.
It is the Chief Pelikán, who are drinkers of thirty-fourteen years who swim in hospitals.
Annes de Hořo; where he worked since this year, he worked for a decade in the pediatry in Motol, where ambulances led young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter four times."
"Empe to the twelve years, when they brought it with 3,5 alcohol in blood, as well as a mixture with extasis," indicates the doctor of the Department on this case.
"He was located at Holecho's ferry at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that your mother didn't surprise that her daughter would disappear 48 hours," the boss surprises.
It is exactly the lack of parents' interest or even their clear tolerance to drink by their children, which is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts indicate that, in the case of children, it cannot be said of dependence.
"It is understood by alcohol to a person who has a chronic alcohol dependence since several years ago, with all the phenomena associated with the same, which is not produced in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it must be of a systematic social or family environment failure," explains Chief Pelikán.
Jurinová’s portator, this year in Motol’s pediatric clinic, have been hospitalized until middle November 40 children of beverage.
However, statistics only show those coming with serious toxicity and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after walking medical recognition, go home with parents or police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children are simply gathering after school and drinking carefully, there are three stational highlights that must be mentioned: the day of bridge, the end of the Year and the end of the school course.
"In that case, they drink by bad notes or, in contrast, celebrate the start of vacations."
"In the day of the bridge I came to see admisions up to seven drinking children at the same time," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers who passed the night in desintoxication under the supervision of doctors, in paradoxy, have the benefit that the next day they do not suffer a terrible reassure at home.
The morning head pain, caused by deshidratation and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of glucose and nutrients who miss the body.
"They take it much better, because after the wounding night, they arise well and don't hurt them."
"Only confusions are shown about where they are," said Pelikán, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when they see the expenditure they have generated.
Transfer to ambulance and hospitalization into a room for serious patients comes to cost a decade of thousands of crowns.
"I often used the cost as a means to educate them, when in the visit I tell them exactly to the children how much he has costed their embriague and that they would have to pass all the summer in a job for young people to win enough to pay it this night," adds Pelikán.
The medical insurance, in its opinion, may be as a revenge measure, which seems to make people the expenditure of treatment, does not make it in the case of children drinking.
Two aircraft L-159 are first located in hands of agenes in Spain
Two L-159 aircrafts of a total of five, where the Czech Defence Minister substituted the aircraft Casa C-295M, shared on Thursday for Sevilla, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time a device of this guy is located in the hands of someone who is not the Czech Army.
At this time, they were only in the foreigner to perform practice or demonstration flights.
It is the biplasic version L-159T1, which even used the Czech Army and was still able to fly.
The remaining three aircrafts are the L-159 monoplass.
These are still maintained in Aer Vodochody and the sales mediator, Omnipol, has already been charged last week.
Jan Peischk, from the Defense Press Department, indicates that it is not yet known that the aircrafts will be physically removed from Vodochody.
"The monoplass L-159 aircrafts, however, were separated from the aircraft prepared ago, without investment or additional contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplass was changed in their current state," said Pravo Pejšek.
He added that the army was not left without biplasy aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for a quantity of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 unnecessary devices for biplases.
One of the new aircraft has already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
See Pejšek, EADS committed to adding aircrafts to the equipment of some aliated countries.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that the EADS company is the one who removes the L-159 aircrafts and will serve for NATO pilot practices."
"So it depends on the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework," said Pejšek.
The Hospodářské noviny published ago that, for example, the Spanish Army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a house aircraft and the purchase of three other three nights for 3.500 million crowns was approved in the past year by the Government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Defence Minister has not been invited to purchase and directly negotiated with EADS.
The current defence address that exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreign.
The Czech Army bought Aer 72'naves and only uses 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
Buying aeroplanes Home may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denied the Czech Defence Minister before the European Court because it should choose the aircraft by making a European invitation and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three house aircrafts and the last should come to Kbely's busy gate in fourteen days.
A longer finger than the cancellation indicates a lower risk of suffering cancer
Men who have the longer than the cancellation are subject to a less risk of suffering of prostat cancer.
This is the exciting conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It could be of the level of testosteron, the man hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the debt can be a simple test of the risk of suffering of prostat cancer, especially for men of age to 60," indicated the Rose Eeles study teacher of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help to determine what men should be subject to a prostat cancer test, especially if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other dangerous factors, such as family health problems, is indicated in Eeles.
In 1994-2009, he followed the follow-up with a British homolog of more than 1.500 patients with prostat cancer and, simultaneously, 3.000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indic finger of the hand shorter than the cancellation.
They presented the same probabilities of suffering prostat cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer rate than the cancelling finger, this risk was reduced to 33%; for men with age less than 60% the reduction of 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers specified during the prenatal period reflects the different levels of hormones to which the fat is expressed in the matrix.
A lower level of testosteron corresponds to a longer level.
Previous studies indicated that testosteron affects the development of prostat cancer.
The big Czech and old president of the Agümia of Scientifics, Professor Václav Pačes, said to ČTK that knows the study, but it does not seem that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "demonstrated completely".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czechland, as most of Europe, was soon-sneavened on Thursday.
The roads and stairs are mainly rubbered by snow, and the distant machines have made it all night in many areas.
Tomorrow the D5 road was closed between 89 and 93 miles in direction to Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial and tourism vehicles, as D1 in Brno in direction to Prague.
Las notices las transmitted the operator del Central Automotor Club (UAMK).
In the 91 km, a truck was found, in the 93th shocaron two industrial vehicles that caused hurt.
A number of tourisms also ended in the county.
There are also problems in the D1 motorway at the 185 miles in the direction of Prague.
There they shocked the trucks.
The drivers must slowly be held after Brno at the 190 km or through Brno and be incorporated into the 182 km in Kývalce.
There are several miles of attacks.
A accident has also occurred on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Praga is inherited by a snow layer of several centimeters and the termometers indicate -7 oC.
They are forming attacks, for example, in Prosek, although it is also congestioned Steerboholska.
The safe transport media is the metro.
Tranvies are with a delay, for example, in the line between Karlovo namisti and Miru Namisti.
On eightth morning, another crisis status will be produced in Prague.
Problems also affect railways and ports.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three quickly.
The problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check the current situation.
The Russian port closed from the eleventh night of the midnight to the five of the morning.
Currently, most of the roads of the South Moravia can already be held, but with extreme care.
In Vyskovska, three secondary roads are closed, in Brnenska are sharing snow languages and in Blanenska are needed strings for certain ways of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
By the time the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kuczeov and also Sharatice - Milecho.
They'll need freshers to deal with them.
It can't be said for now that they will be opened to the holding.
In Hodonínska, it is re-served in the area of the Bel Carpaty (White Carpatos).
The roads of the region that, since it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in inert state, are collected up to five centimeters of snow, it is indicated in the CTK.
In Czechland they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches the 18 centimeters.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, they fell about 15 centimeters of snow.
Snows gradually emit in Czechland.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapons"
The American Army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time only by the encoding name XM-25.
The Generals hope that the new rifle affects the local conflict with the Taliban and that "changing the progress of the game" makes its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise pointer.
His balls are shooting with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm calibra munition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contains actually results as a small granate.
The projects can be planned to explode not only when they struggle the goal, but at any point they are found in their balistic traictory.
They can be used against enemies who are hidden after an obstacle, a wall or a trincher.
There is no doubt that a normal protection can be used and, when the murdering rain of metal styles, it may result essentially in the battle.
See Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new fusil is the first weapon for investment that uses a "intelligent technology".
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the goal, point to their laser ray, which determines the distance, then gets a precise viewpoint and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and approves the cat."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the cat is pressed, the gun is loaded and laid the projectile at a distance of 543 metres, more than one, two or three metres," Audette states.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu consortium after his office at Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July of the next year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building in the Marienbader space in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Consortium Fujitsu after his office in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As the specialised sector's gigant reported on computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will be followed in July of their previous office building in Marienbader Place in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large full of offices in the street Lyoner Street in Nederrad, Frankfurt.
A carrier of Fujitsu explained that in a middle-term 100 employees more than the consortium, which were previously designed by the region, will be allocated there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
Moreover, Fujitsu will be the only inquiry in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central place with an excellent infra".
The powerful connection to the port is currently very important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new change in an important company in the region led to joy in the yesterday among those who were in favour and deception among those who were against.
Head of Frankfurt's Economy Section Markus Frank (CDU) suggested that there has been a Global Player.
This is a "magn recognition to the placement".
Fujitsu is sitting in the city, the seat is a great impulse for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruker, Michael Korwisi (Green) is deceived of Fujitsu's decision.
The address was first informed the city about its intention.
"We have naturally offered our help to the company," Corwisi stated.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader space have not been able to change in difficulties.
Finally, the economic reasons produced the fall.
In this way, there is now a big empty place to cover in the position.
"I hope the owner and the building holder will be cooperative."
The immobile used previously by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighborhood "Vertical Kleine" were part of Marienbader's surrounding buildings of space since ten years of a conversion project of the Balnear city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between station and assembly, a new entry to the city is made to be critical about the massive building that previously used the woods as a parking places and the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment consequence and taxation companies, the software manufacturer for reservations systems, Start Amadeus, and then Siemens joined the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was purchased by the inmobiliary group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Grupe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later returned to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, originating in Tokio, is recognised as the third worldwide supplier.
It is available to companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The office at Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largests in Germany, in all ways Fujitsu accounts for more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions branch is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Nederrad, the following branches in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That is why 7000 squared meters have been acquired in the Astro Park office building.
The earlier completion of the twenty years, its name is glorious to its plan in the form of stars, is among others at the central electrotic association and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Amenages against Assange
Anxiety is always more than Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the discovery platform from your server.
Political pressure may be found behind after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the Wikileaks founder, appears to be arrested in England.
Wikileaks' discovery platform is always the white of critics, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for a Internet country in Europe.
The known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boicot.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is located in the list of people looking for Interpol, must remain arrested in Great Britain, is a article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the revelation activists communicated by Twitter message service on Wednesday (local time).
Never before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from your server.
Internet activists had reacted in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon Services Web to be able to face high numbers of access to documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we'll assign our dollars to contract people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of his server through Wikileaks, after a Senator Joe Lieberman's employee had requested investigations, the CNN string informed if a call was called to the office of Lieberman.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with boicot, informed the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take these measures before, before the previous information publications classified by Wikileaks," the Senator stated.
Lieberman also requested the platform to also use the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and unconscious process of Wikileaks plays our national security and threatens life in the world," a communication of the independent senator.
"No company responsible, already American or foreign, must help Wikileaks with his service to expand robbed material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, which is searched in Switzerland for suspect of violation, is located in the list of people searched for Interpol.
It is a article of the London "The Indestect", the Australien of 39 years is arrested in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has continuously qualified the research in Sweden as a tram of his enemy.
The Wikileaks portator, Christinn Hrafnsson, came to London that had threats.
"There were even called on a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's security, Hrafnsson's crazy.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains unexpected.
Hrafnsson reacted clearly before the statements of North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, suggested that the responsible for Wikileaks' revelations should be judged by tradition and must be executed.
In Canada, a Governing Boss Stephen Harper's adviser, clearly with ironicity, in television, Assange should "be murdered" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange grows a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the carrier of the American President Barack Obama, qualified of "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has requested the release of the state secretariat, if she is responsible for ordering recently to diplomatics involved in spying tasks.
"I'm not sure why you should import a guy's opinion with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our external policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website."
The American Government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Travers, an added director of the National Centre for Distribution against Terrorism, was appointed as responsible, announced the White House.
Thus Travers is responsible for developing "the important reforms of the Âles", which are necessary for the light of Wikileaks filtering.
The White House also wants to inspecte the paths, as well as to change the total information about the government and protect it.
Furthermore, the American Government announced that for the security of dissidents and activists, the publication of Wikileaks should be in danger.
"We have done everything we can to contact them," he said the Porter of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to help protect them if necessary."
The Iron University
In "Ilato" in Bolivia, there are noise in the best times of the year.
The basic course of three days for cold futures has the most affliction and visitors of the world.
Actually, where's all the ice?
The gelatine and the ice.
The gelatine produces crema is all the rules of the Italian art of the processing of helados.
The yellow goes out with a rubber of the ice cream of the shower, spreads it over the ship and sells it.
To know this, it doesn't need to go to Anzola del'Emilia in the province of Bolonia.
But whoever wants to know more about helados should not visit the "Jelato" of the Italian Carpigiani company.
The manufacturer has equipped the iron university with the congelator in 2003 so that the ice cream of its machines comply with the high Italian ideals in all parts.
The basic course of three days for cold futures has the most affliction and visitors of the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate yellow and practices in the fertility of the house.
In these critical times, some dream with a new professional career, others risk the yellow beauty of their desires.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passed by Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art of California, likes the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a European quality product in the land of industrial iron.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business adviser and wants to create something own in some years in a great work.
Two young Egyptians dream with opening a jail in the Cairo.
A man in Malta and another in Brazil wants to improve the quality of the hedges of their bars, and a Canadian house-love, Julia, comes because his children love the Italian.
The Yellow Teacher Luciano Ferrari explains later to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect yellow.
It is not only decisive for his good pleasure, but also for his honesty and good consistency.
Luciano doesn't give his training or birtherta of the country's higher house and mainly the south of the country: "The Italian yellow is just the best, and therefore every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the design seems easy.
Luciano ejects the basic ingredients: milk, born, milk in powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large bathroom, which calms everything with a electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment heat it up to four degrees.
Then opens the griff of the machine and comes out a pasteurized white cream, the base for all types of milk helados.
Immediately, the teacher asks: Can iron creme be designed only with natural or without stallation?
How can you give a retreat to some kinds of experiment?
Luciano advises you to avoid the trends of the time.
He who speaks of iron "not only of natural ingredients" has best used stabilisers, mainly a natural product, probably pure goat, of fridge healthy.
Of course, it can be designed iron without stabilising, it is only necessary to buy it one day, put it in a box and the client will shoot a yellow brain sound.
Some variables in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As regards the yellow pleasure, the teacher Luciano distinguishes the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or the sweet of the supermarket.
Moreover, there are powder and powder.
"All suppliers will collect aromatized ingredients in their goods."
"And they must ever experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will be returned a yellow cream and with cocao in powder as a base for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Current participants can now use helators.
Luciano allows them to prepare every time four different types of wallet yellow, chocolate, brush and avellane, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanille or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with fruit iron types.
Better knowing does not necessarily depend on having more toff or more pure fruit aroma.
It is not necessary that the iron of avellans know to dry fruits, if it contains more avellans.
The working group designs the yellow kiwi worship, which uses more fruit, less water and something less stabilising.
First, a balanced mixer highlights the iron sabor, Luciano.
The design of helates is a problem of arthmetic: The pure melocoton with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar proportion of the basic receipt must be exceeded.
For limon yellow, there is a additional part of sugar.
Luciano takes a tool to fix the quantity of sugar of fruit types (me of the viniculator for Oechsle in the uva most).
Happy, tables facilitate the account.
Building iron is not more than physical application as before.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic design of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the iron mixture is baptized simultaneously and is frozen to the temperature below zero.
Nevertheless, all automatication remains out of the small folder.
The Brazilian Gustavo is missing himself and his companions from above down with pure fruit, as if it were an uncontrolled gigant minipress.
"In all courses," the teacher Luciano, "is just a question of time that happens like this."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority of Efsa has been infiltrated in the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
Currently this issue is formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institution for the independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems to be a conspiration theory but we have not documented it well," Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa Group experts on genetically modified plants, and another expert of Efsa has also been contracted for years in the Ili association.
Consorts like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly cooperated in the geneticly modified Ephesus checking standards, which is in a clear conflict of interests, then criticises.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ili's situation and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It's the second time Testbiotech criticizes a collection of interests.
So a high rango manager of Efsa was so shortly without support or transition time to the Swiss Agricarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed its band with that.
Recently, the Medideutsche ́d' (MDR) has also shown personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and the industry, which have performed the Environment General Office as well as a clear parliamentary of the EU.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interests.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are repealed in a report if they are high and technical.
Experts who work in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called himself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policies, including for the risk assessment of biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
In this regard, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants is not checked in the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, does the genetically modified maze in agriculture," -- Then.
Current practice consists of checking only proteins here, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't seek the risks, how will you find?", question, accusator, then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
Scientific research on genetic engineering field since 1994 and currently works in the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, the industry is more, in the United States and in Europe, to influence or decrease the critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists that are not influenced by consorcians.
For companies, critical studies are not published by general rule.
"The industry controls the safety research," keeps Hilbeck.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, totally about 400 kilos.
The Monday was at Stuttgart's station, with the Tuba on the streets.
There were manifestations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September, the excavaions arrived and began to cut a big piece of the north ala.
The land of Stuttgart has never been the same again: Thousands and thousands have manifested against s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As he was prepared, most of the halls are stumbled.
Road on 6.000, 7.000 pieces.
\ilsheimer Muschelkalk, a mixed mixed stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he's 43 years old.
You've got a couple of pieces.
"These stones are residues."
"You don't have to disappear."
It's entusiasmed: "A poor and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he said once, the fum of the cigarettes has gone.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the shoes yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trace of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous depth of municipalities of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen raised his Stein-Reich stone.
44-year-old man treats with old stones.
He bought everything that resulted from democracy in Stuttgart.
"I would be deceived, mourning the gravity or send it to the bathroom," in his office, a wood box that once was a guard box.
He was insulted and threatened, explained, when in September he appeared in the magazines, which had bought the rest of the northern ail to the deficiency company.
He spoke to the 21s hosts for several days.
And he explained that he couldn't do anything absolutely for the back.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Approximately 200 hosts of the S21 took the short of 80 kg, with a price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also with the hope that it might be in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes, a charge of 25 trucks.
Almost half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold ago.
Gardens debt, Paisage garden, debt of projects.
They came from everywhere, and they took what they could take into the malter and above.
Stuttgart's rock of the impulse ago has become "the wall" or the delimitation of Krä¤beten.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," Ê Rongen.
"If I wasn't by the political component."
He goes down to his whole earth, makes a tour for his big kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied the right, interrupted his studies, and later bioology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's loved with the stones.
Along to 4.000 tonnes of stone.
Transport your treasures throughout Germany.
It says he is the largest treader of ancient stones in the country.
Frena.
In the snow, there are stones of stones of snow.
"They belonged to Dresden Marienbrücke," explains.
Blue calice, yellow, calamity, being entusiasmed.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Sign a stone: Red Arenisca, a previous piece of Karlsruhe station.
And keep it.
"Good shit."
Earlier, the little ones belonged to the tribe of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, the yellow crowd of the police head of Stuttgart, the red greenite of the church of Sankt Blasien, from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sudore.
When Rongen thinks about how he split the stones before and moved them with a simple appearance and a road, he feels very devoted.
"I'd be a scandal if something would be destroyed."
It hasn't been rich, in absolutely rich.
But today 14 people have made the treater of stones, as well as songs, a sculper, a hero, a vineyard and a garden have been installed up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," the man who's debt to use the rest.
He's got to go to Colonia in a little while.
There are also stones to save.
Talent light around large potential
Reignes an active disturbance in the buffet.
16 Students are thrown around the pancyls, the tomat soap, and the sweet.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited a trainer to mechanical and design engineering students.
In a kind of concurrence of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future to VW workers and also to do everything about Volkswagen.
Revaliding and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, are gathered together in a body fight around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Its mission: To contract students with more talent from universities before they enter the work market and are contracted by others.
And as universities do not facilitate publications on the ability of their students, it is implied to take the talents in practical projects and to catch them.
The second day of project at the Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins talents.
A lady of the Department of Personal distributes boligraphs, gomits and directories with VW logos.
Explain the young talents of practice and work for students and show them their ways in consortium.
Nico Selle of the Braunschweig Technical University leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both parts: "The students come in contact with the industry and experience."
"In its time, VW can meet students, watch more close to interesting candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some cooperation, says Selle, are not very common.
The newness is that students are so wanted to be so directly.
"The main point was previously located in the technical projects," -- Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is become harder.
In many cases, companies cannot choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If they do not have to be announced and, in particular, to get a highly qualified work hand.
All students of engineering disciplines are located in a excellent negotiation situation.
The German Engineering Association (VDI for its centuries in Germany) was held in October 40,000 vacant engineers.
And, if VDI's prognoses, this empty engineers will grow more.
In the auditorial and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dy responsibility for the talent feast.
Organizes costly contracting events, such as KPMG carrera, a modern yinkana, where participants need to find their path through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promised students to the United States next year.
Participants can also observe KPMG branches and observe the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice in the output.
Only the cream of the cream of many participants is going to the United States.
Universities strive more to choose and clean the high potential of the universities, see Dy.
"We want to subtract the mass with the career."
"The simple trail for himself only if we stayed short."
For the Dy's cazatalent's notes give results.
"We today have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
" Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us,"
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, they are also in the cave, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their fairs of work.
"We're trying to get students in specialized feritions."
"It's about Intersolar," -- Sitha Stübe, responsible for the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner's company has approximately 1.500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently on the company's website are 35 vacant places.
"It's very complicated to fill the vacant posts."
"Keep a lot of time and money,"
A shorter way is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld works with several high schools, for example the Freeberg University.
"Teachers advise that we can practice or perform their teases.
No public campaigns are performed for solar specialists.
Therefore, the company needs to promote with other benefits: personal environment, lana irrigation and comfortable communication.
"A big consortial normally can't offer it," says Stübe, the employee.
In the search of a job, money is not the most important.
Decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good opportunities for accommodation.
It is a study of the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld shows the 55th place between the 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
In order to ask the employee, I am satisfied with the work and the environment in itself and observe the previous conditions of employees.
Stübe, the employee also expects extra points in its classification for its aspirators to work.
"I think the applicant is particularly fixed in the external classifications of an employer's potential."
Wolf Re日 Warler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy that wins a good fame as employees.
He advises your clients to be more sensitive.
And that means, if you're Warler, especially, internal measures.
"The best way to make it attractive as the employer passes by their own employees," he assured.
In the sector's yarn is called Internal Branding Employer, also promotion of corporate identity within its own model.
"Comfortable employees are the best ambassadors."
When it is good for people and identifying it with the company, then the employer can be promoted directly by friends and friends.
"It's like a game with a pandilla," said Warler.
Obama holds new oil perforations
From the coast of the state and of Florida to Mexico Golf, there has been no new oil perforation in these years.
The Government of Washington issued a constant holding and thus canceled its previous plans inappropriately.
The Atlantic coast also remains new perforations watched for the time.
This announced the internal minister, Ken Salazar, Wednesday.
What has caused this strict, at least the following five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" oil platform in April.
Before the unfortunateness that costed life to eleven workers and caused the largest environmental disaster of the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western part of Mexico golf under pressure of opposition and industry.
Participants so wanted to reduce the United States' dependence on new oil supplys from the foreign.
Not even today has been declared about who is the responsibility of the irreparable black sea in the golf.
In the center of criticism, the British Energy Consortium BP is found, which is made with millions of requests.
A research committee responsible for Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the internal minister, raised the perforation moratory after explosion.
Later, different petroleum consortiums submitted requests for new perforation attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to dismiss a new disaster by using harder controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, who has been accused of corruption charges, has fallen in discreditation, is reformed by root.
Obama announced in parallel that the profitable tax laguns for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry publicly declares that the total extraction in the golf will be less thanks to a closer regulation until the date.
"The government's plans are the most fresh for the growth of petroleum and gas industry," states the result of the current investigation carried out by the BDO advisor undertaking - before extraction of midnight.
American Energey Alliance is disappointed by the insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what changes exactly with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are prolonged soon, in the loss of growth.
Ogoniland is destroyed
The water of the rivers is petroleum marron, weighs as a gasoliner: Millions of wheat litres have destroyed the nature in the Ogoniland Nigerian Nigeria.
People live from robe, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari seems good.
"Don't be silent," the environmental activist calls the journalists, "that's going to pass enough oil in your eyes."
The nigerian of 37 years has been able to photograph chicos going into the water to the cup with the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the coloured water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not seen that on the surface flood petroleum marrons.
In front of this, you've cooked up, explains Esther Badom on the coast of the River Bodo-Jetty.
Meanwhile, fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, a impressive quantity of petroleum has become a rotated tuberculosis.
Fisheries in the surroundings of the small city of Bodo had to nave six hours to reach waters full of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and in Ogoniland, it was considered one of the most approved regions of the world.
In the way of the river's river's river running through manglares, the destruction results obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine moves a warm marron, who puts his hand in the water, will take out some full of oil.
The roots of the woods of the manglars are up from the ground as dark grapes of grass, tristly islanding the palms that shock and cut their palms.
In vain are searching flags of birds, as if they were in the humidal as always: As the outer barrier is quiet, there is a species of fantastic calm of an earlier Paradise with a gasolinear hole.
"What's happening here is a biological fight," --currently, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger for health."
Examining the belical comparison.
The area of the standing of the Ogoni is a renewed battle field since years ago: here the first European explorators were broken over 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the employees of the oil.
Today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is still in the day: While they bombed every day more than two million Black Gold Barriles from the whole delta region, three times greater than Switzerland, with more than 5.000 extraction sources and 7.000 miles of tuberies, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too instabil for the consorce.
Each two hundred meters oversalted steel platforms as the structural water sculptures: "Native Arbolites" called lovely to the heads of the perforators.
They are up to 50, most of them have a total corruption.
Each instinct fails a head, Akpobari thinks, then leads a constant oil weeping in the water.
The evaluations of experts have become more than two billion litres in 50 years in the delta ecoa: Years a year, the amount of oil oil, such as in the "Exxon Valdez" ship 21 years ago in the Alaska sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes of the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region, it will lead to it.
While Shell's consorption and organised oil robes are responsible for more than 90 per cent of contamination, the Languageologists see the heads to break up and the tuberculosis with refugees like the main caused ones.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally the conventional world, reprocessed the scientist Richard Ste > to the consortium in 2008: Only the defects of the tuberculosis are "on a greater multiplum than in other places".
In one place, which seems farly seems to be seen, appears a full of petroleum under the free sky, figures of the manglers: They are cut off and oiled.
Among one of the many barriels, which are sometimes united to perforations, sometimes arbitraryly spread on the ground, flame a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barryl, the oil is warming in the most hours of fire, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the tuberculosis in the recipient, later the oil tuberculosis goes and finally comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce every day up to four 300 litres diseal barriers: "We offer 34,000 nairas", about 22 dollars.
Delta populations benefit from the lack of fuel in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria only accounts for a single refinery.
With the absurd and nice price of the diesel of only 40 euro-cent per litre, illegal calenters can offer even less: thus reduce the value of their primary material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which called the network of tuberies that crossed Ogoniland: Experts, at this stage, are lost at least 16 million litres of petroleum daily in the whole delta of the Niger.
Only one insignificant part of the provisional maintened primary material is clearly refused: organized criminal networks, to which also belongs political and high military charges, keep the best part in the Algibs and sell it in the world market.
The Akpobari activist considers clearly academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is better demanded for the management of the population or for the flow of production.
"If oils weren't behaved as invasives and wouldn't have completely destroyed the natural habit of fish, there would not have sabotage, robes, or illegal repeateds."
While the conditions of agoni are mostly disrupted by Shell until the point that only appears a deduction of the consortium: "It may be better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael's nervous.
"It's the time you're going to disappear," says the muscle Olmann.
"The soldiers can come every minute."
If the special military unit takes illegal refiners, it does not threaten them to arrest them, unless they are painful.
The north soldiers also want, like all the Nigerians, to benefit from the primary material.
"This condemned invent has completely made pieces to our country," → Akpobari.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in the A380 engines
It seems that A380 has a great security problem.
In a survey of a machine that made a strong territory, researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce "a catastrophic error in the engine".
The Qantas line wants to ask the engine manufacturer.
The Airbus de Qantas passengers who performed an emergency territory at the beginning of November had much more happier than what could be imagined: Australian air security authorities have experienced a great security problem in some A380, and warning about a possible factory deficiency.
The defect potential has complicated effects: In a combination of manguits, the ATSB authorities may cause fat or grid fictions, announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic error in the engine".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircrafts of the A380 series.
Among those who are located in Qantas-Airbus who had to make a strong landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian line starts legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He presented a request in the Sidney Federal Court for more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his line will recall a refund for the incident of the beginning of November.
The engine mark has lost pieces and its axis is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines around the world must be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they would perform more security tests to the superjumps with the engines concerned.
The Security Recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, Martin Dolan, ATSB transporter.
The security problem has become sufficiently important to inform all the affected.
After the emergency landscape of the Qantas equipment, the line holded its float A380 on earth for a lot of weeks.
Singapore Airlines held approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on earth.
Airhansa rejected the A380 engine as a precautionary measure.
This aeroplane with doublerta is the biggest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada throughout the country causes chaos in traffic
Dutch totally white: From one day to another he has snowed in almost all the country.
In many streets, the chaos is running, the trains and the aircraft fall.
At least three people have lost life in accidents of traffic.
The winter hell Germany: Almost all the country has reached iron temperatures during Thursday night, which has decadened the chaos in traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15-centimeter snow layer.
Traffic is very limited in most autoways and in many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the kitanieves are still working, removeing the new snow once and again, but it is not prepared.
Furthermore, strong wind races bark the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Agency of Germany (BSH) expects living marines with water level 1,2 metres above its habitual level at the side of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Sajonia, snow acumulation caused significant problems in the roads and national roads.
The Meteomedia service is called the red warning in Sächsischen Switzerland, actually the highest warning.
There are partly 30 centimeters of recently falling snow and cold and strong winds are worth to arremoline it.
There were a lot of trucks and cars in the night.
In Sajonia Anhalt, the police authorities also reported important destructions in the streets.
In A2, the snow and the wind paralyzed traffic and created attacks.
Needs affected the A4 and the A9 in Turing.
See Deutscher Bahn, large travels are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turing and North of Baviera.
The snow on the road, the trees fallen on the carriers or the destroyed catenary and the snows are the main problems.
In Sajonia the interurban service is suspended from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Turingia, a ICE train had to stop his travel to Munich.
The bombers and the salvation service were accompanied by the 165 passengers on the train with lana, food and drink.
The winds with snow bars the streets.
In the largest German port, winds with snow caused many flight suspensions.
A carrier of the flight information center has already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am, there is 40 flights cancelled in Fraport.
Quitanives are still working.
However, there are few passengers in the port, despite that there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, midnight afternoon, there were many accidents.
Last night, a carrier failed in a collision with a train in a road cross in Ostholstein.
The machine has suffered lack of hurt.
In the neighborhoods of Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred because of the snow streets: A truck was also reached in a road cross because the vehicle was drawn.
The driver lost life.
In the train, four passengers were hurt, Bayreuth's refuge to Nuremberg was locked for this reason for the morning.
Moreover, a 30-year-old woman failed, after giving a bullshit with his car near Aschaffenburg on a balanced road.
The organs have a good news: the snow will be always more snow and type of powder, so it will be arremolinated in mild rays.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to do much cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Godche Bank looks for a buyer for his tours
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from his symbol: If a article, the financial institution seeks buyer for his office tours at Frankfurt's seat.
The property could offer up to EUR 500 million.
Recently, Deutschen Bank arranged her seat: The towers were modernized in Frankfurt's campaign; while the bankers returned to their former workplace.
But now the financial consortium is likely to benefit from the costs of the reonvation, and seek a buyer for the two races, as "Financial Times Deutschland" is based on a portfolio.
The carrier does not designate the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check if you should have the properties or sell them and then get them back," he advised.
Therefore, the largest credit institution in Germany rejects its company's seat after a short time period.
The acquisition of the tours in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros of the investor of a household fund and then made its relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached a number of approximately 200 million euros.
One sale would offer a lot of money for the sale.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the towers of the period renamed as "Greentowers" in about 500 million euros.
If the renewable buildings are sold in a fund of the fund or to an independent investor has not been currently revealed, the carrier was denied.
Thousands of people of battle for mistress
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried mines, which were given for misled after many explosions in a mine.
The cases have not yet been found, because security measures are still preliminary in the place of unfortunateness.
About two weeks a intense explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth city.
29 miners of age between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A survey was introduced in the place of ungrate, but no signal of superequity was discovered.
Because of the high concentration of toxic and successive explosions, no salvation equipment could be reduced for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts claimed that there were no possibilities for minerals to be overcome.
The body could not be recovered until the date.
The family and friends currently react to the defects with a memorandum act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the sun’s reflection in Greymouth in the Neozeland Island of the south.
They save silence for two minutes.
In the homenage of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the cakes, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also personal photographs and objects, under clothes and surf tables.
The flags were even devastated before the government buildings of the country.
New Zealand hoped that miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," John Key, President of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the Memorial Act.
"But they never came home."
He can't assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the President of the Government and the victims' family, many foreign diplomatics participated in the Memorial Act.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African Miners were also buried.
Saving workers started extinguishing a fire inside the carbon mine in the southern island of New Zealand.
As explosive gases have been extracted, abrasive temperatures from the mine's interior will begin to descend, Gary Knowles, the superior of the police, told the journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the kitchen go in the art movie?
The director Nicolas Winding Relf is again to explore gender borders with his "Walhalla Rising" battle epopeia.
In what public would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Relf have thought when running "Walhalla Rising"?
A Vikingo warrior captured with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost overhuman fights, sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, exactly because our heroe likes to use brutal methods to kill and throw his enemies the trips of their body with life when he's in a bad humor.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, does not say almost any word during the whole movie and the other characters are allowed to carry out as much one or two phrases or a couple of painful death cries.
In contrast, they are silent and enjoying beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes, which the bastidors offer to the world viking about thousand years ago.
More ideal for grown and interested cinemas in existencialism and very quiet camera movements.
When a movie has several groups of players, it is a pen that can't be rejected mutually.
The director Winding Relf considers his sales and trilogia on the "Pusher" drug trafficker as a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but it is extremely refused to make their works for all publics with something more humor in the main or something less brutality of the artist house.
A brain mass and some brotan trips cannot disobey most of the artistic cinema followers.
The majority of the fans of the action dies in disturbance, if Onejo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a multitude of violent Christian missionaries for interpretative reasons, and there is an eternity in the calm and cloud before his team comes to America and rests there.
It's a worry that "Walhalla Rising" hasn't found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and just be on DVD.
It's a calamity against the wonderful images, but also because, after the presuntuous and bloody fascinated, a movie piece of sometimes exciting, which deserves something of attention.
This film doesn't handle dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febril dream transformed into films.
And that's why there is no escape for the spectators.
Relf is just a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and the luminous sound band of trance makes him a node in his garage, especially the incredible hate, which from the hearts of the persons goes to him.
Only a little young rubiet, who supports Unio faithfully, keeps something like innocentness, all others are inherited by anger.
In particular, the heroe of a single eye, whose reasons are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of the village for the enemies and provisional aliens, perhaps in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents it by-- but maybe only for those who are lost in all ways.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and amazed, to hurt, change and surprise.
A experience.
Mysterious land moves
The OIEA nuclear energy organisation has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country will think of this subject until controls are allowed.
About the midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli fighting aircraft F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located in the coast of Eufrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 km is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (OIEA), talking about a reaction that the Syrians appeared to have built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley out of the river.
Information about the U.S. International Intelligence Service at the end of April 2008 is designed by a current reaction under the name of the very closely close to the plutonium production of the Kibar, with which nuclear weapons are built.
Instead, the technology serves only for other purposes than for the fifty years.
The → showed a video presentation with worm satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the components of the reaction were before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, they learned graphs that showed the building from nearby or from within.
It was a short time ago that the reacter was working, he says, but he was still not equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later from the bombardement, it is just more known than that, then, the enigmas were made greater with time.
The former President of the United States, George W. Bush recently showed in his memories that before the attack, the Syrian was fully sure that they had built a reaction in the Kibar, but that only saw indications that there would be "a nuclear weapons programme in the country".
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more decent and only speak of a "super reaction", although they consider "plausable" the presentation of the §.
They miss solid tests, as well as the OIEA.
When he was asked about the security that he had before a reacter, a high diplomatic of the VN answered in summer that the OIEA had "suficient material to have questions".
The Syrians were very quickly disheshed from the shops of the presumed "unused military building" and spread the ground to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, a team of the OIEA under the command of the former inspector was found uranio races in the Kibar, which had been produced by people.
Furthermore, the OIEA received satellite images on a Member State, of commercial sellers at the moments of the attack, which should have a higher information value than the presentation.
However, these graphs did not come to the market because a unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them in a way.
Therefore, the OIEA cannot check its property independently.
Syria always understood that he had never had a secret nuclear programme or built no reaction.
The urian was from the Israelite weapons, explained.
The OIEA is like an invermosimil after the analysis of the particulates.
Since then, it has refused to discuss the matter, as regards satellite images.
Furthermore, controllers are prohibited of a second inspection in the Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the bombarded building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"Nothing we will say," Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister of Functions at the time of the attack, confirmed recently the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not resulted since June 2008 and "progressly transformed into a serious problem of credibility for authorities", as a western high-country diplomatic corresponds to a place in the OIEA in Vienna, finally a serious infraction against the treaty of non-proliferation of atomic weapons, which the OIEA looks at.
The OIEA considers three more teams as the key for progress in the clarification, which must be "functional" with the assumed reaction, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not given public knowledge until the time when the teams are treated, or what functions they have, or if they seem to be suspicious.
The Southdeutschen Zeitung period is designed by the OIEA as internal to Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again from the neighborhoods of the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and locations a completion of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is very probably one of the suspicious objects.
Perhaps it is located in or immediately by a military basis, Syria prohibited the entrance to the three places to the OIEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the United States have requested the OIEA to spy military plants.
Nuclear detectives were warned about equipment thanks to the warnings of the Secret Service of the United States.
Through satellite graphics, the OIEA has indications that it is materially between the three places and the cube at the edge of the Eufrates.
A west diplomatic with a high charge in Vienna warned that at least one of the teams could be "related with fuel production".
However, there is no "conscious activity" indication of uranio or reconditioning; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reacter is ≤ with uranio that is not rich.
Where the uranio should come from and where the plutonium should be separated later for bombs, for these central questions, there are, in the best of the cases, pleasable suggestions.
There are no doubts about whether ruins, valuable tracks that can be recovered, are located in the three places.
As the hundreds of loading trucks of the ground disappeared, no one has information about where the shoes remain.
The OIAE considers unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, which was able in the few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Eufrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for their capacity as a zone for radioactive residues.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous inspector of the OIEA, related her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, the graphics from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the OIEA requested the entry.
It can be like ability, but it only contributes to discipline of suspect.
Moreover, in the diplomatic sector, the OIEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians will allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only show the size of the interest of the inspectors.
However, this proposal also criticizes.
Western diplomatics in Vienna a year ago have satisfied that the reacter was already destroyed, so the matter has no much urgence, since a few months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador of the U.S., writes the called inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, Director of the OIEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "a option to which I am open in the future," but still empty.
This path is very dangerous: This is the most need for the OIEA governing consequence, and some of the 35 representative countries there are not exactly anxious for a scale.
On the other hand, as a diplomatic thought, "What's going on if they do not find anything?"
Love in the times of war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie eats in summer with the address of its debut still without name.
She himself wrote the script, a story of love between a bosney and a serb.
You do not know much more about this, but this is enough for agitation.
The sound is very persistent, women, muslims, are intimated by their serb violator during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosney women's associations have quickly protested, with which at the last time they have planned a few days of road in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been rounded in Hungary and the post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the female organization of war victims wrote to the United Nations High Commissioner, ACNUR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actor, informed a bosnie period, Jolie is the ambassador of the United Nations High Commissioner for the Repositories.
It's not diplomatic. Women offered him a meeting in Hungary a week ago.
The meeting occurred in Bosnia, Hasecic.
Love stories are not given in violations fields, and Jolie's position in respect of victims is enough about the script.
Your organization in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for the Resorts has recommended that Jolie be placed as an ambassador, reporting the Guardian.
But what did Jolie just write for the scenes?
The Bosney Cultural Ministry reading the script, traveling after a train and disturbing a license of halt in Sarajevo, it is not clear why Jolie was not at all.
The young author repeat that he does not follow political purposes with its film, put it in a lot of efforts in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of war and vote to all parties involved.
Its content remains unexpected.
In the network there is a second synopsis of the film that sounds very different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and returned to meet when she, a Muslim boss, was deported to a serb field where he works as a guardian.
What it sounds like different is the variant of violation victims loved by torturing.
Jolie's movie really begins before war.
The pressure on her, Jolie, is "injust and based on wrong information".
Currently, you can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues illegally on the network, as many others previously.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon it's going to be good for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry with joy when the high music is buried, they shoot the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vives in the Southern Cork, because players start, and finds, beer bottles from a distance of three meters
The strange spectacle is called "Beerpong", and the premium for the winner is 500 euros more aircraft billets in Las Vegas for the world campaign of beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type, this extreme drink game and the informatic discrete actually do not make good mixtures.
And the 26-year-old boy enjoys it, distractions from the fulminant question, what will be the future.
The entertainment in Las Vegas is not in its plans, and in January a personal interview will be held in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presentation."
"It's very far from home and I don't have any job there yet."
At least: His girlfriend waits for you in Auckland, "with a shoot, he convinced his dreams to work as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and dreamed.
Because of the bad perspectives in the house, two of the three Tanners brothers have already been looking for happiness in the foreign.
His sister Yvonne, a social work, is in Sidney, his brother Colin works now as TI adviser in London.
Young people go: There are many families like the Tanners in the island.
1000,000 Irish will leave the country in a near future, promote experts in economy and the ESRI social research institution of Dublin.
By 2015, 200,000 immigrants are counted.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Prognoses are confirmed, there is a story comparable to which the island suffered in the eighty years.
After a degree of progress that brought a great welfare to the Irish, the melancolia is currently extended.
The economic crisis confunds mostly young, well-formed Irish, for those who are up to now.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three of each ten men and women less than thirty years are in the park.
In the Irish Times, there are letters to the director in mass of young immigrants, which claim that "In Ireland everything is hungry."
"There should be a rise against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, is going and lost our country and with it to a whole generation."
"The last one who closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a legal student and president of the Irish students' union, appears a shadow future because the government is only dedicated to mounts and no longer offers future perspectives to young people.
"Reduce the minimum salaries, but they have no strategy to achieve new jobs," the 20-year girl.
Note how their companions go from practices that are not renumbered to the following.
His greatest concern, explains, is to emigrate for four years.
"This idea is trist and deprived."
People like Stephen McLarnon see this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a ferry that offers a return service to the issue of work in the foreign.
"For those who start working, doing it in the foreign is a great opportunity, the first steps to guide your career," the manager.
On your website there are photos of a boy practicing surf in Âa and of another practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working in the foreign is not like to do it in the gallers, unless it gets freedom and entertainment.
Since half years ago, Sean O'Donovan knows how it's building something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, now he worked with 15 Irish companions in the construction in Germany.
Now they're up a modal tent in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his patriarch only a few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for his house in Ireland.
"The situation is a little funny," -- because a long time ago the first time he pissed the shadow of his house.
"I get money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
Something's ridiculous, and it's going through cold rooms.
The small house is in a elegant residential area with care of gardens before the houses, in the entrance are stored large and dear cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
"There were crazy times, there were easily money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to miss the credit?
O'Donovan thinks about a mouse, serves more heat and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything comes wrong, I can start from zero."
Civil engineer doesn't like the wounds that often hear now.
"Nobody should be hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, so dramatic as in the past times here on the island,"
"The work of a season in the foreign isn't the worst that can happen, maybe with that we feel first as Irish."
He reigned and counted on his father, that in the last large economic crisis he went to England.
" After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future and just see how life is elsewhere.
He worked for a few years in London, and why wouldn't he go well to him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But in these days there is a thing that concerns you to overcome: celebration of his 27 - anniversary on Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I can degenerate at a breakfast party.
"Only, not too much emotions," he says and gives a bird a bird.
"Despedid, it sounds very embarrassing."
"Better we call her a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Rutine
The support for democracy in Latin America continues to be increased, as well as the support for private companies.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in large part of the region, Brazil is viewed as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last enquiry of Latinobarometer in 18 countries and published by The Economyst.
Since the investigation has been regularly conducted since 1995, it allows the monitoring of the changes in the region.
The results of this year's investigation, carried out in September and the principles of October, are two related issues.
The first is the animated humor in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of democracy and its main institutions.
The support to democracy has increased consideration in various countries of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached a average of 6% of the year since 2002, democracy support has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
He also grows in Mexico, where the economy has been recovered after suffering a large decline of production last year.
However, only half of the Mexico and Brazil enquiries, the two most popular countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (see graph 2).
Approximately 44 per cent of the questionnaires in the region were declared satisfied by the way democracy works in its country, the same number as the last year, but considers more than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (graph 3).
Approximately 34% suggested that they trusted in the Congress of their country and 45% in their Government, the same amount as the last year in both cases, but considers higher than 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Since a deity, the economic turbulences in Latin America have severely affected the support of democracy.
The fact that during the world financial crisis, many Latin American countries have probably been affected by a short receipt and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social security network has contributed to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty conditions only marginally in 2009 and that it has been reduced again this year, up to 32%.)
However, the state of encouragement varied from one country to another (see graph 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outcome president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and has increased violent crimes.
Secondly, since the investigations began, more questioned in Latin America mentioned crime instead of unemployment, as the seriousest problem of their country (see graph 5).
Approximately 31 per cent that, whether they or a nearby parent, the crime has been victim in the last year, a number that has been reduced from 38 per cent of the past year and which is the minimum percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic results are reflected in a higher support for private companies and market economy: about 71% of the inquiries in the region are that private enterprises are essential for development, while in 2007 only was 56% (see graph 6).
Approximately 58% agrees that market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared to 47% of the last year.
It is interesting that 62% of the questionnaires in Venezuela consider the same (and 80% supports private enterprises), although its President Hugo Chavez, is exhausting many private companies.
Brazil is the country who exercises a larger leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of the questionnaires (from 18% in the past year), followed by the United States (9%, the same number as the last year) and Venezuela (9% before 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the most influential country of the questionnaires in Mexico and large part of Central America, while Venezuela shows such title in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Selection to Wastebasket
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they were farer than the fears of foreigners who helped the country to remont after their problems.
The votes were introduced in the urns, some people voted several times, papers taken in the cattle, devastated electoral colleges and intimidation acts.
Electoral colleges opened with hours of interruption.
Numerous haitian, including groups moved by the January territory, went through the area to discover where they had to vote.
Some of them, finally, were given for vengeance.
One decade of candidates to the presidential, including several of the most popular, claimed fraud and requested the cancellation of elections.
Protections, some of them violent, have been extended throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the largest rand officer of the United Nations in Haiti, declared that they were "good elections in many senses."
The observers of the United States Organization and the Caribbean Community have cautioned that "We do not believe that these irregularities, for seriously, are necessary to invalidate the process".
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, which is held by its counterparts, is committed with René Preval, the immovable outcome president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The challenge is provided in January.
Not all hopes have yet been lost in relation to elections.
The two main candidates in the opposite, Michel Martelly, a reporter, and Mirlande Manigat, a former lady, have rejected their initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But there can still be problems if the electoral authority states that Mr Célestin, who only has support, if you have any, has passed on the second round.
Since the cholera epidemic is broken down the country and more than one million of the survivors of the earthquake still live in tents, a great abstention is expected.
At the time, many haitians wanted to vote, but they did not be able to do it because of a lack of organization.
Approximately 250,000 identity documents necessary to vote have not been distributed shortly before elections.
There's a lot in game.
Assistance providers consider that the election of a popular and legal government is a key step in the rebuilding of Haiti.
And if it has remained patent, the Haitians also think about it.
Advanced points towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great simpatia between the public that has increased its popularity in 20 points, up to 50%, the largest level he has registered since his election in 2007.
Nevertheless, that can make it a successful campaign for a second mandate in the elections of the year that comes will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fernández leaves the intransience of her dead husband, its precedent and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not concluding.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to carry out economic policy even after his wife had occurred to him as a president, had the habit of developing budgets that infravalled the tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to cost additional incomes to their discretion.
In theory, the Government of Mrs. Fernández lost its majority in the Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has threatened after Kirchner's failure due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some disrespecting members of the powerful peronist movement have been held to Mrs. Fernández.
However, after some caotics, in which a lawyer put a point to another in the face and other members accused the Government of the sovereignty, the Congress decided to make the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss," said the President.
The budget of 2010 will therefore be applied in the next year, which will offer to the President an even more action margin than the time of exemption.
Economy is improveing consideration: probably grows up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently located at 11,1%, but a number of private calculations, as well as the salary requirements of the syndicates, are situated nearly 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who adopted the power in 2003 when Argentina was at the border of the economic collapses, made the growth and reduction of poverty its priorities instead of the control of inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the FMI, pressed the private sector and made the INDEC, the statistical institution, to adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now modify these policies?
He has convocated meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the universities.
Moreover, their officers want to limit salarial increases in nearly 18 per cent year.
Economy has been emphasized by the high prices of the argentin agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the growth impulse achieved with a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps it's right, Mrs. Fernández's giving signals to want to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government reached an agreement with the debt holders who had rejected a forced repair before the debt that Argentina had not been approved in 2001.
At present, Mrs. Fernández seems to be able to conclude an agreement with the creditors governments aggregated in the Paris Club, which must be about 6.700 million dollars.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve the supervision of the FMI, as it seems to be usual.
However, last month, the Minister for Economics, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund would offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price of national consumption, which seems to be prejudice to INDEC.
It is not clear that President Fernández wants to continue in politics when he completes its mandate, taking into account that she has no husband anymore.
If so, you will need to win the support of the average class, most of which has been disturbed from the chirchnism.
When the argentinians return from their steady vacations in March, the sympathious oil for her will be deceived.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not, with quietness, many of your husband's policies.
Medium hurry by China
The voters of Taiwan are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his great brother on the other side of the street?
More than 7,5 million voters, 70% of the electoral, came on 27 November to elect five citizens and concealers, as it seems to be a broad evaluation of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma has been defensed by the continent, providing innovative business connections, including a free trade agreement, the largest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for a while.
Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) ended by wining three of the five elections at alcalde, he did not get the majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic progressist Partie (PPD), which has been drawn down by a total independence of Taiwan, had approximately 50% of all votes before 45% of the KMT.
If they were presidential, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since two years ago, the proportion of votes in its party has decreased about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD met KMT in the meetings.
In the elections, the typical elements of the Taiwan elections were seen, including rushing campaign trucks and big aglomerations with small dance banders and girls.
The mysterious trial of murder was also not missing.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the honorary president of KMT, was campaigning by one of KMT candidates tonight before elections.
A man of the multitude shot the young man right in his face, kissing him and killing a translator.
Interestingly, it was not able to determine whether the man wanted to hurt Lien or to win the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, has affected the elections, seeming suspects on the PPD and providing the voters to turn away by the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was amazing that the issue of the continent was not concerned in it.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public housing plans and employment creation.
Thaiwan usually enjoys its independence of fact and hates China's military threat.
Hence, the KMT is supposed to avoid publicizing its connections with the Government in Pekin.
But this time the PPD also avoided strengthening the feeling against China.
It answers the new consciousness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic super-economy.
For its part, Mr Ma said that it had been confirmed that its policy in respect of China was acceptable for most Taiwan.
The Pekin Government is expected to continue to be subject to trade, in accordance with its strategy to achieve that Taiwan returns to the road.
China did not lose time by sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summary on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Of course, you would like to get political integration, but the first is the first.
The best will be expected to pass the presidential elections of 2012 for it.
In any case, the PPD has revenged.
Two years ago, he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was accused of corruption.
The President was openly encouraged the explicit independence between 2000 and 2008.
However, under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has occurred and the PPD is trying to attach professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as PPD candidate for the Presidency, as well as its Tseng-chang, who has fulfilled the mandate under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible for demonstrating that it can also have relations with Pekín.
Mrs. Tsai announced the creation plans of a group of experts acting as a point of contact between PPD and China, unless negotiations could be carried out without preliminary conditions.
Mrs. Tsai says to the Taiwan public that its party represents a "true alternative" to Mr. Ma's predicted approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious for the change.
In a statement issued from its cell, he suggested that the PPD candidates would have gone better if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even commanded Mr. Su, a pragmatic, to not present to the presidential.
Even without interviewing Mr Chen, the PPD will have difficulties to choose between its possible candidates.
KMT must also make a conscious examination.
Mr Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT's candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT transporter who will re-re-work his office, as well as local equipment.
The large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan's support to a closer is limited.
At the same time, most Thaiwanians believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
If Antonio Chiang, a known colonist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Names to the Grammy: the jazz's song Esperanza Spalding is the surprised choice in the Category of Artist Revelation.
He acts at the request of a president and probably people will be fixed on you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year jazz bathroom and songing, personally selected by President Obama to act in its ceremonie of the Nobel of the Peace Price in 2009, submitted one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Artist Category.
Taking into account that Spalding has been a claimed figure of the jazz from its 2008 album, "Hope", the nomination of what to think, but he respects the Grammys standards which must be an artist who has not taken more than three albums to the market before it "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitional album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", was uncertainly a great progress and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great happiness with influenzas of pop, → and latin ritmes, can at least be established a distinction between Spalding and the path to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent for the voters of the Grammys, which recently have been focused on the jazz area for this category.
In the remaining categories, the voters of the Grammy made honour due to the "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, an emotional and magnical disk that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer competitors is the saxofonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and John Beasley technology by "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a favorite expert in New Orleans and normally invited in "Treme", of the HBO, was honoured in the modern jazz category, which remains attached to the fussion as in Stanley Clarke albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The salvage punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society obtained a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, counting against the big jazz of the Billy Childs Camera in-- and the always risked Dave Holland, whose live album with its oct, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bathroom at his side.

The Mexican proposal in Temecula is approved by the Order Committee
The Mezquita project for Temecula has obtained a single support from the Local Order Committee after more than five hours of public witnesses, often accommodated.
Critics attacked the project by promoting terrorism and attacks.
However, members of the committee decided on midnight that the new religious center respected the local legislation and would be impressive from the steady point.
"Mury good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or heritage, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of the Temecula Valley, said the Thursday.
"The truth is that, as a American citizen, I'm angry."
"He shows that justice is overwhelmed."
"The opposite is really less," adds.
"Only that they're talking very high."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The empe · at the sixth of the evening and was almost half night; most of the time were dedicated to people who interceded in favour or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, is the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the magazine website.
"United States no longer exist," it is read in one of the comments.
"This is another Simio Planet with Mrs. Libertad died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The islamic centre construction plans have also caused protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero area, the area of New York where attacks were held on 11 September 2011.
In the Temecula Valley, the Mahmoud Harmoush imman has denied violence acts.
His congregation of about 135 families has years with no problems in the Riverside edge, but he wanted a larger and better space than the storage that was acquired in a property with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new mixture of 24.943 squared feet, with a mediterranean architectural style, would include two minerals and would rise up to the 43 feet.
I would take a surface of 4,32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents still can repeat the project before the municipal Council.
A resisting arsenic microbio provides the possibility of new ways of life on Earth... or in other places
The discovery of a strange that can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the possibility of finding new ways of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curiosity here on Earth, they say that it is possible that there are forms of life without the main elements that were considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"You can grow with phosphor or arsenic."
"It turns her into something very poor, even though you need to be a kind of life really "alieingena"," Paul C. W. Davies of la Ar日 State, with the report that appears in the and inside the June of the Science publication.
Since a long time, there are six major elements for life: carbon, the aggregate, nitrogen, oxygen, fosfor and sugar.
However, researchers have discovered that the phosphate, located in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after its establishment of the arsenic phosphor.
"It makes you imagine what more is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Ar日 State, with the report.
Anbar indicated, the finding is important for life search on different planets of the earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know the aspect you have.
The study is focused on a deteriorated microbio on Earth.
However, the convocation of a press road to discuss it, where there were no detailed discovery, generated a huge speculation on the Internet on the possibility of the report to indicate the discovery of alien life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to impulse their biochemical and that the set of elements that we consider as indispensable for life may not be so fixed," remarked Charles Cockell, Cathedral of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open; in Milton Keynes, the United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of an element by another in biochemics and basic biochemics," added Cockell.
The discovery was not performed by challenging.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, which led the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high arsenic levels.
The arsenic and phosphor are similar from the chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbio exposed to both could put one to another.
"Arsenic is mostly toxic because its chemical behavior is similar to the phosphor."
"Consequently, it can be complicated to the different bodies."
"Even though, the arsenic is the pretty different as to not work as well as the phosphor, so it comes in and, in some way, calls my biochemical aircraft," explains Anbar.
Researchers collected the characteristics known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to more concentrations of arsenic, which could be adjusted and used to grow.
The microbio grows better with phosphor, but the fact of demonstrating that it can live with arsenic in its place is the possibility of naturally existing a form of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth, or in another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology in Florida, indicated that the idea that the arsenic can be put up by the phosphor is not new, but it has never been found an example to prove that it works.
The arsenic was most common in the first ears of the Earth, so researchers indicated that the first ways of life could have used it.
"It suggests that there could be other means to generate life, not only the way life was formed on the Earth," Foster indicated that it was not part of Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by the NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The robbed dogs were found missing in Compton.
The two dogs missing the four robbeds before Bellflower motel were found, and the officers of the sheriff of the Los Angeles conduit were held on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Gales Corgis Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they were lasting the night, before Bellflower Motel 6, were notified by the authorities.
Two of the caninos were recovered midnight, and the remaining two were found on Wednesday after night, and Steve Whitmore was informed, a portfolio of the sheriff office of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good state."
"They're flying with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore didn't want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which barry, or the circumstances of discovery.
"It's going to take a research."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some tracks."
Can't find dog owners, Christina Rickard and David Peek, to make some comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a resort of animals in Downey midnight afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the furgonet and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a dog of 10 months) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to show in the competitions of the area this week in the name of the Japanese owners of dogs, followed away until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national campaign in Long Beach this week and were intended to show Trace.
The other dogs would show them in other competitions planned for the days before the AKC/Eukanuba campaign, Peek to The Times was indicated on Wednesday.
The south of California is one of the stops in the nearly two months round that make the couple participating in hair competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard did the check-in in the motel.
They usually remain in motels and park the furnace right in front of the window of their room.
They took three other dogs (a boxer crew, a teth Parson and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the furniture because they have a very gross powder and they would be more fresh.
They left the windows lightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced the furnace's robe on Tuesday at the sixth morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a re-equip to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, microchips to identify them.
Thursday, it wasn't clear if a king would be given or not.
The lion is ready to ride again, while MGM re-reactivation obtains the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally reached green light to start again.
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Affairs of New York officially adopted the "pre-armad" plan by the creditors to remove approximately 5 billion dollars of debt, extending the way to the 86-year entertainment company to focus on its efforts in the production and outside of films and television programmes.
Thursday failure confirms that the plan is complied with the needs of the code of ́arrota and ́, so there are no other legal obstacles that MGM retreat under the founders of Spyglas Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 integrated.
In fact, MGM will not be out of Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a scheduled credit instrument of $500 million to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
Investment facilities are currently synchronising the credit, which is by its account contributing to $75 million, and it is expected to be financed at the middle of December.
The review process of the study eats in May 2009, when the investment of Moelis and Co. was contracted to give advice on the management needed to order its funds, while he was fighting to make interest payments for $300 million per year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex president of Enron and expert in the recovery of warm companies, known by his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial distress and to satisfy more than 140 students needed much more time to expect.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company on sale for the end of 2009.
However, the substance attached a few posters and no dispute to pay over $2 billion who were seeking the creditors.
Before this year's firstborn, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began to work in a repair plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreement, was finally supported by the creditors for October.
When MGM officially gets out of the road in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillionary bonifications for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1,2 million, will be paid to $9.5 million.
Cooper's companys, who have recovered $375.000 per month for their company management services, will receive a 4 million "success honorers".
Barber and Birnbaum were planning to reanim the production in MGM, which was only a movie this year, and gathered a year of seven or eight films that would be out of 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The study needs to concert a separate loan between 265 and 275 million dollars to finance its part of those two films, which will be guided by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, which had approximately 18% of the MGM debt, was trying to arrange a combination of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he was the largest.
However, the recent conversations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of your budget for gifts
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful player of this year, followed by, probably, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant meal in your budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of a iPad, five BMX bicycles can be purchased by 99 dollars each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic hours added with accounts, or approximately 48 sides of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to maintain your budget for equilibrium gifts.
Recently I visited three national players, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic games could buy less than $80.
I was immediately clear that the Law of Moore has worked; the technology game of this year will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to the last year.
Moreover, while there are less new games with associated websites, two of the most familiar of this type, Webkinz and Penguin Club, have more offers.
And games impulsed by button piles are growing, as well as reloadable battery games.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless it is indicated otherwise).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are peak games of the size of a cobaio that sing a note when their barricans are covered.
A appton is equal to a note, and a second appton begins to arm a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Precaution: When it starts to appreciate, it can't stop.
For the end combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking delivery from Elmo Live technology last year, the Animal Munich of 14 pounds plays turning games like Simôm Dice, and can make the moon step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with blocking devices.
Children who tried the player used Mickey as a dancing teacher, although their parents were disturbed for the lack of a volume control.
If you are a kid of the 80s, you can remember Al日, one of the first computerized educational games.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more) with a full of questions cards designed to convert a car passenger into a session with an incoming room of autocorrection exercises.
If you are reassured to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo de VTech (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years) is the most beautiful and easier to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; even though games do not learn so effectively as Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years), is the first point of the Leapster line, with a newer and more powerful screen.
No version is compatible with the old cards.
iXL de Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses a iTunes type system to present games and electronic books, and has a ranura for SD cards that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-screen only larger game than a grid box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to arm words by putting the blocks in row before the time ends; it is amazable for an improvised competition of word weapons.
They are still more players who have some kind of online connection.
Only based on your presence on players, the two largest are Webkinz and Penguin Club.
To buy your son a online mascot in the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack (5 dollars, 6 to 12 years) which includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you change the online code, your son gets enough credits in the Penguin Club Tent for two articles.
These could include paints on wheels or a mask player Puffle.
Lightly larger than the grid of your teeth cheese, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a microboot line impulsed by button pills.
The insect moves quickly over 12 silicon bottles that live in random directions.
It's funny to make a block lab to see if you can find output.
It's also a long time.
Our was able to leave the table of the kitchen and even a mouse in our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance in China is promoted
As a city instructor Sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step on a place of the city, inspecting the nervous people in their charge, sending low orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the police officers of the city order of China, feared and disfellowshipped by their caprichous energy measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a punch of spectators.
"Firmes!"
"Watch!"
Show them, he murmured, "How the beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who only passed the adulescence with white bullets and similar green cups and pieces adjusted to call attention.
Four pairs of black bags perfectly aligned.
Four elegant shadows placed perfectly above the hair attached with ray moons to white and white rays.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," Mr. Tang said, increasingly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to make the picture of the city inspectors in China.
A city ordered that all new recluses had a degree title.
The Guangdong Provincia changed the green green color of the uniforms to a more attractive.
Wuhan, in Central China, substituted the use of force by intimidatory looks: in 2009, it was a report, 50 officers surrounded a snick carry, and observed it constantly injured for a half hour until the ambulance seller collected his things and went.
Xindu, a 680,000 citizen in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, it has added to its city police 13 women, expressly chosen by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police a slightest side, woman.
Sorry, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's increasing respect for these scenarios in the city.
And for a good reason, the critics would argument.
In contrast to the police, these officers are only authorised to carry out the orders of the city, imposing wages and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media are routinely retiring a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Provincia of Hubei killed a transaction after using their cellular to film them while solving a protest against a deficiencies.
Last year, a training manual for Pekín inspectors was hurt and published on the Internet, in which it was described as an efficiency to criminals without making them bloody.
This year, a walking Shanghai sandy seller suffered brain damage after a river with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for online, presents inspectors trained by Chinese who attack travelers.
"Chengguan has left a cicatriz in the government," China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactic conflict.
The newspaper was "a really meticulousness".
The skeptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
After the eye of a warning of eight new female recluses in October, a editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked if women had real debt or were just a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little of both things.
The warning of the female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonised faces".
They should have a height over the average, over 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 pounds.
Return to the age of 26 is mandatory.
The officers said that the work was physically too hot for women over 25 years.
"Your image is the important thing," said a anonymous officer in Rednet.com, a web site of government.
"For the first time, the external quality of the candidates will determine whether they comply with the requirements, such as the height, weight, the faces, etc.
Then the temperature "and the internal qualities".
Women's arrival are like flowers, he said, and he aggregated, "being flowers, they'll have other responsibility."
Zheng Lihua, sub-director of the town administration office, is not anxious to support that description.
But he noted that high-time requirements were standards in many Chinese work warnings for both sex.
Then comes the need for harmonious face rags.
If this means to be appealed, it is a matter of debate between Chinese.
The negative or disfigured should certainly not be presented.
"We can't let a kid or a jobman come to work here," Mr. Zheng said.
"Your picture wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, has 22 years of age, with its colored wheels and a subtilly curve mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her aspect is sexy, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year working partner, Xu Yang, said, "Our work must present the picture of the city."
They also do not oppose their work at a certain time, they said, because they cover greater ambitions than simply acquiring sellers in the roads where they should describe their business.
Each morning, the squadron is more or less than a dozen of walking sellers that lay up or in bicycle, trying to sell both pancills or tofu tazones as possible before it is cast.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We've told you many times!", said Miss Xu while a seller was running away, and temporarily left his car taken by bicycle with video warnings.
The officers describe their duties as more monotons than agoters.
"This is more or less the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20 years old, who studies marketing in his free hours.
"My rutinary."
One reason is that women's officers do not have the power of their men's homologs to confiscate the Sea of the sellers.
They can only threaten the offenders to their men's overseers.
This aims to protect them from the repentant public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were emphasised to divide the voice that some officers arrived had killed a seller.
More than one decade of police or officers chengguan were hurt in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were volcanoted or arrested.
Xindu has now avoided such violence.
But the calm is only guaranteed.
Only two roads of the paciful Plaza Baoguang, where women's officers passed that morning, more than 50 people gathered together in one eas.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the rail instead of in a taller, as the regulation requires.
The owner of the moto cried bitterly.
The situation was extended for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad face, moved to the coads to their vehicles and were quickly with the motorcycle and their owner.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old co-ordinator assigned to the man's squadron, remained behind, with his white insignies returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, 40-year-old men, play a pure support role.
In contrast with them, they are not allowed to keep a elegant image.
Sometimes we fight verbally.
"We sometimes fight physically," Mr. Li totally naturally said.
"The most of the time is the public who starts the fight."
The taxes will not be charged against Senator Ensign
The Senator's lawyers announced the midnight that the taxors of the Department of Justice have excused Senator John Ensign of the criminal imputations that came from his business with a former campaign assistant and their efforts to ensure work through lobby for the husband of the woman.
The decision ends with the more severe legal threat that Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered as a possible presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal on its matter had national holders last year and hurt his career.
The Ensign office said he felt "securely happy" for the decision, which came after a whole year investigation.
The Senator could still make a disciplinary measure of the Senate Ethics Committee.
The Ensign lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a goal of his research and that he has no plan to lift charges against him for this issue".
The Department of Justice did not want to make comments on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, which said that it seemed to have significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have confusioned to violate a federal criminality on lobby.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first distributed in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of its assistants, to gain profitable work through lobby, to achieve Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the matter of the Senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasure of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign was contacted with several political patrocinators to find work to Mr Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had contracted Mr. Hampton to make lobby for them, the documents and interviews are held.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, it was excluded if the law to make lobby for his former employer or Senado for a year.
Ethical experts said that the inu arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were intimate friends before the business, appeared in a disagreement with the name "revolving by lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict that ex national employees use their connections to make personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "he seemed to be a first case face of a conspiration to violate substantially the revolving state of door," Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington, specialised in defense of customers investigated by the government.
While the officers of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasons behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the department seemed careful at the time of accepting political processing after several important reviews for its public integrity section, including the decision of the last year to abandon the processing against the former Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of charges for the bad conduct of procedure.
"The federal taxes are clearly cobardes," said Melanie Sloan, the Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought a number of defences against Ensign in the case.
"This is basically meaning that high rango government officers now can assume that laws are not applicable to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that received a telephone call from a fiscal from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call on the next day, saying that the department would not want to lift charges against his customer.
The Ensign Defense Team was cooperating with the taxors in trying to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in a statement on midnight, "is acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain detailedly the legal arguments he gave to the tax officers.
"I don't feel comfortable to enter into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, but I can only say that we think they have taken the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Committee of Elections decided to change an investigation in a chain separated by the ethnic group, which claims that a payment of 96.000 dollars from the Hampton parents violated the electoral federal law.
The electoral committee said he had no enough evidence to demonstrate that money was only a gift.
NV Energy is an important company of Nevada who has long supported the senator, which has been able to work through lobby thanks to the help that Ensign gave Hampton.
A email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, the Ensign office head, John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and told him that he was "making" the Interior Ministry on a matter in discussion.
Ensign also attended a holiday with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a Â on the name of the airline after he had contracted Hampton to make lobby.
When the news of the matter appeared first last year, Ensign asked forgiveness to his electors and rejected his position as a quarter of the Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for months ago, Ensign said to the journalists who planned to postulate a third mandate in the Senate.
When the Ensign voter, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer subject to a criminal investigation, the Senator said that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
"The Senator Ensign wants to continue with his hard work in the name of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's calling will point to Twitter
There were a half-dozen of them in the rows of the court room.
A minute a minute, they sent reports of the wonderful witness through Twitter.
Finally, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages on the process of violation and children attached to their beds in a house that was taken fire.
On Thursday, the broadly followed process of Steven J. Hayes, who was condemned by the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have presented writings in the court that describe the arguments of the appointments that probably will occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reports about the process, including the wide use of Twitter by massive media journalists, created "a cycle atmosphere", and such a generalized and immediate saturation with higher details made public patients exercise an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force the appointment judges to address the question of whether the new technology repeat new rules in the court room.
"It's what I experienced during this process, I think there's a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the court room affects the rights of the individual to have a righteous process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main defence lawyer of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of the first instance Jon C. Blue, of the State Superior Court, lacronically requests in a mistake last week, saying that the news media were "awarely controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been brought by the passion.
But it's probably not the last word on the subject.
The Courts of Appeal have recognized that the covering of celebrity cases may generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historical error of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States revoked the condemnation of a Osteopat of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, by his wife's murder, saying in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnaval atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime was inspired by the television programme and the "Feeiling" film.
Some lawyers said that the Courts of Appeals who examined the sentence of Mr Hayes in the middle century later could feel interested in the argument that new rules could be necessary to control the form of communication from the court rooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern on the impact of the new media" in high profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of the Stanford Law School, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report on which it was said that this was made arbitraryly.
Professor Donohue said that some appointment judges could feel interested in the idea that limiting the immediate communication from the court rooms could make the judges more righteous.
The question of Twitter is only one of the many themes delineed by the Avocates of Hayes, which probably will be discussed for years, repeating an execution.
Defense lawyers also, for example, that Hayes could have been threatened when the Court of Blue refused to test the reactions of the potential jury, showing the famous records of the crime scene during the selection of the jury.
Some jurymen have said that they were terrified by victims' graphics, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their daughters, Hayley, of 17 and Michaela of 11.
Defense lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, and they will stress that the judge was wrongly removed from a jury that had criticized the tax officers, and that he had wrongly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to decide for a weekly end.
The jury weren't cut off.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense covering of the process can affect most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for Governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media continued to throw the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily aglomeration of the media, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "it was never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in all the state."
Its attention on the cover of Tweeter is controverse.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the wound on the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports submitted more slowly, were a lumped vision that would make the court's policy on the control of covering was weak in future processes.
However, some lawyers said that the appointment courts often felt attracted by the arguments on the adjustment required in the courts due to social and technical changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that claim.
In his writing, they refused to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which rejected the sentence of Dr. Sheppard due to the covering of the process, and clearly claimed that the new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 20th century."
Can civilians have a pool to join the divisions?
After a notable campaign for invectivity and negativity, this week a little civic has been deceived in Washington.
Is it a prejudice of a real future bipartid cooperation or an illusionary moment before a quick road to the partial fight in the capital?
The Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not produce any progress in the major issues to be treated during the outcome session.
However, all of them say, it was at least a short discussion on the differences of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their responsibility to govern, rather than another empty episode to win partidistic points.
The public holding of the president's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences between members.
It seems clear that the interaction has generated a mutual respect during a period of months that is still separated from the members.
That is just enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Now both parties are in a testing period, it is mutually considered to identify signs of cooperation and commitment, while they are trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
The reason for which the Tuesday and the later evaluations of the participants were made with a minimum needs or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republican are too large and are very deeply attached as to suggest any quick climate change that was in the last two years.
If there are taxes, expenditures, health assistance or social assistance, both parties are in the opposite positions.
In all ways, the election of November has sustained the humor in Washington, at least short-term.
"It is no doubt that things have changed about the way to say things," said Pete Wehner, a officer of Bush's administration now in the Ethical and Public Policy Centre.
"They are inevitable after elections.
Elections discover partial patents, which then extinguish.
That's good."
In some issues, particularly those in the agenda of the outcome session, the Republicans and Democrats have no other option to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions are won at the end of the year, and no one is for this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is a commitment to enlarge unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of the reductions of tax for riches, refusing unemployment subsidies for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday in the White House, there is more optimism for a possible treaty on these issues during the outcome session, together with ratification of the new nuclear disarmament agreement START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institute, warns that the cooperation successful in the issues of the outcome session will not necessarily lead to a continuous bipartidism when the new 112th Congress is meeting in January.
On the contrary, he acknowledged that it is very easily and even inevitable, which begins a disagreement period.
"When the things to be done should be carried out, psychology will shortly return the situation to a comparison," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is broadly implied) on the fact that civic can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the 2012 main development," he said.
The reasons have much to see with the constitution of the new majority of the Republican in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, which were decisively contributed to its creation.
More conscience that the Republican leaders have on the dangers of excessing their position, they know that they must try to comply with their promises to cover the costs of the state and cancel the new health law.
These partial lines are already clearly observed in the initial reactions against the recommendations of the Deficit Committee, including the reform of the tax code and the increase of certain taxes and age of jubilation, and expenditure.
The co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been acquired of one of the most difficult works in Washington and, if their own assessment, have introduced the issue of deficit in the order of the public day in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Committee of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been fighting to reach that number.
The greatest resistance is among the staff chosen on the panel, suggesting that in fiscal matters there are at least few bases or desires for the commitment.
Galston preaches two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and the Congress.
The first year will occur in the form of partial shocks, when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a larger period of bipartid cooperation.
What would cause change?
The public opinion.
There are significant evidence that, despite the recent election partyism, most Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If comparison leads to a dead point, as happened in 1995, both parties will take care of the reaction of people.
Whoever thinks you're losing will probably change the course and seek commitment.
However, this may be a optimistic vision.
Partidism and pollarization are currently greater than the middle of 1990s, and it seems that there is a larger ideological place between Obama and the Republicans of the Congress of the Congress that was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at its time.
At the same time, both parties' activists see 2010 as the prejudice to a more transient election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism that is shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find common points in the issues that still divide them.
A document and filtered document returns to Moscow as the Paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy" and leaves a part of the sovereignty and protection money that comes directly to Kremlin, it was reported in February to Embajada and in Russia.
It was informed that both the police and the Federal Security Service managed a huge changing system, which helps to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They recover money not only from legal business but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stretch of bureaucracy, which the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "Verticalness", takes its part as the money is up to the scale.
The note, sent to Washington under the name of Embajador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censured.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still head of Moscow, and it was a great part of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed him in October, but there has been a little evidence of an ease since that time.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a major building company, have systematicly refused corruption accusations for the years, and he has won several library requests on such accusations.
In September, when in a Russian television channel they asked him about a documentary that would suggest it was corrupt, he said, "It's a crazy, a patrol, a fatigue."
Inquiries are identified, the Russian believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is inevitable to find the details explained detailedly, since they were in the ambassador report, and it is unhearted that they are the diplomatics of a foreign country who do so.
"The direct slaves of the Government of the city of Moscow with criminality have brought some to call him "disfunctional" and to act more like a claptocracy than a government," the note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a crisha (a term of the criminal world and mafia that literally means "tech" or protection) that cross the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the fiscal office, as well as all sectors of the Government of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-level level in the criminal world in Moscow."
"Luzhkov is in the highest."
"The SFS, MVD and Milicia are at the second level."
Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill an empty in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report is that the SFS recovers the money of the largest companies and that the police refers to small trades.
One source, was the report, "explained that Moscow's trade owners understand that it is best to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of the organized crime groups) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal pandillas is no more a priority."
The note notes that while money recovery is complete, protection may be irregular; even those paying are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay rapidly find their business closed by a pretext or other.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but he has admitted that it has achieved a little progress.
The note of the ambassador reports about men taking males, probably full of money in effective, within the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust in the bureaucrates," George Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscu, said in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"He doesn't belong to a political class, because there is no more a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separating powers, the corruption is inevitable.
At national level, Indem estimates that the corruption costs Russia more than 300 billion dollars per year.
In a recent investigation on global corruption perceptions carried out by the non-governmental Transparency International organization, the country was classified in post 154 (the countries are classified at least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the note of the Embajada and, which has not happened until the evening of Moscow, will certainly cause disgrace within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be guilty of Moscou's weaknesses, it may be a chance that Kremlin's argument that is resolving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lying and repeatedly repeated by a revelation that the diplomatics and the diplomatics called Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we don't doubt that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
The Veterinary of the Red Years obligated to take place the past
In a lowly iluminated school, with walls broken and discharged, the director of the Secondary School Anlong Veng remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"All of us love Ta Mok here."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the Government of the Red Jemers, the commander remains popular in this remote ex force of the Red Jemeres in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, pounds and other infra-economys, and where there are still thousands of ex-solders of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers were ridden before the government, the long-term loyalty is finally disappointed in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed the victims that would be publicly responsible for those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the Government distributed here a secondary text book that for the first time the history of the Red Jemeres tells the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemers, sentenced to the former head of the known Torture Centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, best known as Duch, at 35 years of prison.
With each of these attitudes, anxiety has grown between the Veteriners of the Red Jemers of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts to reconciliate and their efforts to reintegrate the Cambodian society.
"There is sensation and fear between the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, a independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within the family."
The Government of the Red Jemers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, was executed or died of famine, disease or work, approximately 1,7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and destroyed the Government led by Pol Pot, the rest of the regime and their military soldiers fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that was during until the last movement that was rejected in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of warriors from their bases on the mountains and west Cambodia's wildness, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, after a United Nations peace agreement led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of the Red Jemery fighters began to devastate to the government, covering Ieng Sary's revenues in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died for natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby mountains Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without support of their benefits, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemers fell into the absolute weakness that is common in the rural Cambodge, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite officers of the Red Jemers have kept their local administrative posts instead of deposing their weapons, racial soldiers are still poor and unqualified farmers.
"This people have received a few benefits after the ren," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums for all Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopic agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept to make business."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Jemers when he was a teenager in 1974, rejoiced in the forest near Anlong Veng before he dedicated himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemers was good," he deceived.
"Ta Mok gave him to eat everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to be self-sustained."
The current court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, the court is expected to start processing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red Jemeres.
The mandate of the Court is to process the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but he has not said if there will be cases other than those four.
This doesn't serve much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the media has been focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who was a leader in the Province of Banteay Meanchey during the Government of the Red Jemers at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Cambodia Documentation Centre that had monitored the construction of Trapeang Thma prison, a project in which it was thought that thousands of forced workers had died.
A recent bochornose afternoon, Im Chaem again worked in the fields to his house on wood pilots in a land road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun stretched long shadows on the rash past, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She warned that if the court would not be invited, she would not be presented.
"Camboya is in peace and stability," he said.
"If there are more processings, there will be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was destroyed from the Red Jemers in 1978, has also warned repeatedly that there will be instability if the court follows more suspicious, even though experts and historians ask him.
"Camboya must cover a bullet and bury the past." He said.
But the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to progress, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation, if Khmer, is back to join the road pieces."
"It's our obligation to gather these roads so that we can understand."
The center produced the first text book approved by the Government on the Red Jemers, called "The History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the textbook of the secondary school of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemers.
Like in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know a few details about the Red Jemers, despite the town's connection with the regime.
Toque Valeak, a 19-year-old student at the Secondary School of Anlong Veng, said that the new text book helped students understand a significant part of his history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he brought the book home to study.
"My family has many parts of the text book and the court," he said.
"They have doubts because they are not sure of the number of people who will process the court."
Such resistence has made the reconciliation process complete and difficult, soak Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, it was deceived.
In all ways, here the Red Jemers keep a powerful pleasure.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a way with too bad herbs and ≥erto of lost plastic balls leads to a rectangle of the black holiday by a oxided box of hojalate.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of neumatians after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell soldier at the border of the road, said that he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place are there to rescue him," he said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where he would leave a manage of mature places with the hope of having good happiness.
Belarus accepts repealing its uranio reserve for weapons
In a surprising victory for the campaign of President Obama to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Government of Belarus announced the mid-day that will reject its highly rich uranio reservation, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treaty was revealed in a joint statement published after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton had meet with the Belarusian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Martynov, at the margin of a security summary.
For years, the Government and Government were trying to convince Belarus that he rejected his highly rich uranio and seemed to have reached a point without return to the past first.
But the officers and officers told Washington Post that a couple of operations classified with Belarus were carried out in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of uranio qualified for arming a white-russian investigation installation.
This prepared the territory for the midnight agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, is a officer, who spoke from the anonimated due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Country of 47 nations presided by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And therefore it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summary in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated because they wanted a place in the Nuclear Security College of 2012."
"This shows that this process is working," Ken Luongo, President of the Society for Global Security, said a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement was "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all the vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the Government has helped six countries to disable all its highly rich uranio.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A decade of countries did it under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security College, the Belarus President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never reject his urian.
"We have kept the highly rich uranio ( hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified for weapons) and the low enrichment uranium," Luchenko said at that moment.
"This is our primary material... we're not going to make sucking bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, it's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in achieving an agreement.
The officers claimed that the first task to remove the Uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated, since the material had been lightly irradiated.
The officers said that it was loaded in a special train that traveled over 2.000 km to a Russian installation for storage and elimination.
The officers are held, the second operation ends on Monday and was carried out in a plane.
The Government and Property costed $13 million for the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus the installation of low-riching investigations, which is not adequate for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a officer of the Department of Energy working in the Global Amenaza Reduction, said that "This was coordinated and orchestrated with much care to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
James Martin Center for Nonproliferation assessed this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranio calified for weapons, as well as hundreds of highly rich uranio uranio.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation to 2012, if the joint declaration is presented.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tensed for years, mainly due to the awake repression of Lukehenko of human rights.
But Wednesday statement suggested a potential distance.
It was stated that "when the progress in these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and the Belarus recognized that a higher respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue to improve bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not fix flights
The Spanish Government did not fix the flights of the → with the Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda with direction to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, and the US embassy was expressed in a telegram in Madrid.
This reflects the documents filtered by Wikileaks in the journal El País, where it is added that the first president of the Government, Mary Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested the Spanish Executive to be informed "to demonstrate that they were able to exercise a close supervision of foreign aircrafts through Spain".
In June 2006, after a report of the European Council in which he accused of complication in practices contrary to human rights to a decade of countries, including Spain, there was a range between the former North American Embassy Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The President recognized that the Council's report " had taken the Government of Zapatero out of game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega highlighted that Spain has no repairs for the intelligence flights to the Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" to avoid being "deceived pills", reports Aguirre in a cab.
In addition, Miguel Angel Moratinos, who was holder of foreigners, indicated to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "will give this matter the lower profile, though, while being in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited influence capacity."
By its part, in January 2007, the fiscal Vicente González transmitted the Embajada that would not lock the initiative of the judge to request the disclasification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Defence Minister for Flights.
"These reports do not contain any in-actor or sensitive information," explained the Embajada after talking to the tax.
However, the U.S. reflected its concern for the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German fiscals", more than for the disclasified information of the CNI or the Defence Minister.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre denied.
In March 2007, in a village between the US ambassador and the Ministry of Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he recommended that "although the Spanish judges are rabbiously zealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of retorical inflammate, in an attempt to decrease the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the PP in this matter.
"For its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not doubt to capitalize any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or decisively ignored EU actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative impacts to the Government of the United States."

Then talk about a message to the mobile that just received, "I want you to return this month or give me a direction to send you to the child."
"If you don't like me to leave the cry with my mother, I'll get it when she comes back," she says.
In May, he talks about the return to his people, "This week I'm going to go, but I'm only going to be until 19th, for the 20th I have to present a job to not do it."
He explains that if everything's fine, he's going to his firstborn.
"I'll be with whom to be, or, with me, and never in my life will happen to me to leave it again with no one who is not my mother," doubtedly given his bad relationships.

Populars would win 4 songs at the Congress and PSC 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona municipalities
After the significant increase of votes and Members experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalogue PP has already the view of the generals, therefore, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this training receives in these committees is likely doubled to those receiving in the catalogues.
Thus, the popular catalogues received 610.473 votes in the Generals of 2008, while in 2006, the number was 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this tend to be held up, which has been nutrited from a transfer of votes from the PSC and the faithfulness of the PP electorated, analyses of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 members in the Congress, while the CTU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would have nothing less than 9 members (intained 25).
These estimates would find that the catalyst place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
It is the analysis of the populars, ERC was a Member - now he has three - while ICV would stay with a lawyer or win one.
However, to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate meeting will be held in May 2011 with the municipal committees, where the populars may also be determined at the end of the socialist hegemonia in the four provincy capitals and in their reference to the Deputation of Barcelona, one of the more budgetary administrations - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
So many nationalists and populars coincide with the possibility that the PSC loses Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not gain most of them, nor will they recover their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
According to the Republican debat, this training would not be deceived to lose its representation in the Barcelonian Council - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can protagonize the poultry in the Tarraconense capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist alcalde, Josep Félix Ballesters.
In Lérida, the PP has held only 500 votes from the PSC, whose colleague, Angel Ros, maintains very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, have been found several times.
Populars have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalogue and encourages to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passengers to Al Qaida
Besides the seven arrested in Barcelona, there were three
The seven Pakistanians and Nigerian agents arrested by the General Police Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a Yihadist cell that, guided from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of the Land Tamil" and "Lakar and Taiba" (Let), the last of Bombay's attackers who caused death in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior has granted great importance to these investigations, until the point to ensure that the "Kampai Operation" has been "deactivated" the Al Qaida Implementation equipment at international level and, therefore, "they operational capacity".
Researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years he has been active in Catalogue, has been able to send thousands of passengers to Thailand, where they were distributed and then distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxie Al Qaida so that their "combatants" can cross the European borders and other western countries with total impunity.
The exciting cell is not the only one that the yihadist network was operating in Europe, which have participated in investigations, as well as the Thailand services, other European police units, so it is not rejected that in the EU's territory they are carried out in the next days similar to the development of the last March in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand, another developed with the capture of the Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Tailandian Syrialaya Kijbum.
These were the leaders of Bangkok's cell in Spain and other European countries.
The catalan network - part of it was struck in 2009 - was mainly stolen to passport tourists who comply with the requirements marked by the World Islamic Frente.
The documents should be on behalf of 25 to 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without printed views.
In the middle of the research, no data has been found at the present to the catalogue arrested with Bombay's attention, despite the author of this attack, "Lakar and Taiba", had been one of the groups of receptioners of the passengers stolen in Spain and then disabled in Thailand.
However, it is necessary to remember that days before this attention was made, from Catalogue were sent to Â of a transfer agency of some thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that later were used by the "command" integrants that ended with the life of 106 people.
Police has been covered by documentation.
The PP requests but to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to express it personally to Artur But its conditions to support its investment as the President of the Generality, identical to the already placed campaign and that they are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and predicting filo-suberanist aventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to put in the equator of his mandate.
The Chairman of the popular Catalogues came to Artur Mas with the security of 18 members in the elections of the last Sunday, numbering more than enough to wish, since the CTU candidate needs at least one of the trainings that will exercise the opposite to the vote of investment.
A possible understanding of the PP of the future covenants that nationalists want to keep on the Congress when general elections are celebrated, but now the conversations that they hold on this day But with the rest of political leaders are made in Catalogue key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support a investment, "will have to park all sovereignists and independentist talks", as well as the economic concert - similar to the Vasco country - that the convergence leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have a common position to enhance the political equipment of a very efficient autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax of subsequences and donations.
The details of the negotiation on the investment of Mas will be occupied by the PPC, Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But it has already been gathered with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a strong opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geneatricity that the deaths were not by "fault of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not dismiss that his cellar kills more than 11 elderly
The responsibility of the geneatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press road yesterday to deal with the damage caused by the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the employer who, while he was there, killed at least 11 elderly who had his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared together with the letter of the center, advocate Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of the Charity would be able to execute the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibility force us to take the processal situation of civil responsibilities".
And it is that, besides the social disturbance that can suffer by no time detecting the criminal activities of the celitor, the great threat to the Carity covers now the form of sustainable compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' families are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilme has admitted that the first crime is remonted to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhaustation of eight body - old patients in the geneatric - which doubted that in many cases no doctor was personally exploiting the defects but that, in age and pathology of patients, the phone tram was discovered.
The Charity, to its director, rejected this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures could not have been the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is no only indication that there has been an unrepentant action from any other person who is not the own imposed."
The already baptized as "Angel of the Death" admitted 11 murderers before and detailed that the first crime committed it on 29 August 2009 for, one month and a half later, killing a second grandfather.
In this case, the death of pinch caused him a overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime that committed it, is helped from a mixture of seat pastills.
The Director of La Caritat states that it is complicated to control that the staff in the centre has access to medicines.
Insulin penchases and seats cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimines that the man, in his way, used to deal with the internal suffering, used to kill them.
But they will be the analysis that are done in the § who must declare whether Vila does not lie and seeks a less cruel death for its first victims or, in contrast, he has embraced them inside the district as he has already admitted that he did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In the Charity they don't believe the demonstrations of the cellar, nor even if it is to the number of confessed murderers, who do not dismiss that it is greater, and justifie their Property in the various versions that Vila has given in its visits to the judge and in the short sense that it must change its way of walking after having done successfully eight murderers.
That is why they say that they are available to justice to explain the achievement of this event.
The ECB threats
The investors repeated brushfully yesterday to Trichet's threat that warned "the markets should not subestimate our reaction capacity."
Periferic differences have been closed with strength and European actions have increased more than 5%.
However, we should not also underestimate the ability of the ECB to wrong and the euro just pointed out what is a concernful signal.
What has happened yesterday is the own of an illicit market, as well as it is exploded, but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be late in fear.
A month ago, the ECB has quoted us today to remove liquidity measures, and it will be tomorrow four times in two years and remaining.
The Bundesbank needed to complete the public debt purchase plan for inefficiency and remove all extraordinary liquidity measures at the time and leave only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures "at least to March" will be extended and keep the quarter substance with unlimited access to the end of the trimester to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they continue with their bond buy programme, even that they give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not comply with the generated expectations, they will return the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be obliged to remove liquidity measures, that God helps us!
Like in May, in which they did not have nor considered the purchasing of goods and coopsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be reliable and sustainable.
In May, the bathroom announced on Monday and midnight said he had already bought a lot, providing a new market explosion.
It has been very poor in Portugal that last year.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, against 750 million to 4.81% of the previous substance.
Even so, the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market feeling after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the numbers of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated numbers are about 10,000 million at short term and 15 000 potential and have until February to get private capital or will be nationalized.
While Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the numbers are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, on March next, the Government will have to achieve the parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet enough support, so Ireland is still a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tonne of its speech to relax the face pressure to the next State and Government Chairs meeting on 14 December, where a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will adopt on Friday.
Reform pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial communities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatization, reactivation measures are sounded in the ears of investors like the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Bolsa has reached 4,5%, the double and the rest of European Bolsas.
On the contrary to February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been quickly and constant, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a key to a good to three years that will be benefited by the effect of Trichet, so we hope that it will be solved with strong request and help to discern doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Aid Plan it would be a self-inflation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity than in March, to careful types and close access to the markets without day.
However, the strategy should continue to be the Caesar's woman, "which is to be, it seems to be."
Animo, we can.
The President of Eulen will impose the Vega Sicilia meeting requested for her children
The time is not tomorrow in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, Eulen's owners and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will impugn it, considering "no full right", the Jurisdictional Joint of the next day 16, requested by five of its seven children and at which they will try to make their majority values and to be made with Bodegas Vega Sicilia's management bodies.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary Joseph, are enhancing the legal battery for the new jurisdiction chapter in its litigation for the control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem to be ready to cease in its litigation to be present in the Governing Bodies of El Enebro.
From its administration advice, five of its seven children who were appointed administrators at the employment assembly of 18 January this year and whose impugnation is announced in the Mercantil Register.
The Court of Justice of El Enebro for the next day 16, invited by the judge of Mercantil Number 2 of Madrid, opened the box of the ravens in the sene of the family Alvarez again.
The resource to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the calling of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez as a "unexpected resource of the applicants of his five children to, by processal arguity, clearly fraud of the Law and abus of law, try to convalid and cure the assembly radically from 18 January", is replied on its official portfolio.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly is held, to its impugnation, considering that it is "nule of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discrete silence, have already been without succeeding that the judge would call a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, the patrimonial society and the holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other actives, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the 51% fruit of the capital, is the family protocols.
This is the question of the fund that the judge should decide once the view of the application of impugnation is held, for which there is not yet a date specified.
Red Bull trionfa in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in real time cars.
Since Red Bull irrupted in the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this universal selection of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At the first time, no one took into consideration the options of a recent arrival scadery and, despite the upcoming traictory of the last seises, last November, at the end of the campaign, all had apostated by the Ferrari Triunfo of Fernando Alonso.
Without dismissing the ability as a pilot of the final campaign, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propulses his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapons" which the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to convert it into a winner team.
It is actually a powerful simulation software that Germany placed on the market in 2007 for very far from the highly mobile competition.
Named PLM, this powerful informative tool has been used to design manufacturing chains in the world, energy plants, high precision tools.
The goal is to reproduce, simulate the product or process faithfully before building it in real manner, avoiding failure and avoidable expenditure.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's graphical cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this informal instrument in its factory of Formula 1 has allowed Red Bull to design and take effect "in few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during carriers and tests.
Russwurm explains that Scoderies in 1992 had a average of 10 technicians in their team that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team works today with 180 high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful informal equipment, analyze and project all happiness of changes in the ́aids.
The Director of Siemens explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of Red Bull's elements with the engine, which is of the entire Renault responsibility.
Materials, fuel, dynamic and safety elements are changed.
Changes can be taken from the simulator's reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems through high-technology laser and autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this crazy of the technology perfection is the number of $40 million that each team in Formula 1 may cost as maximum at each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the high-technology factory to design and produce its ↑s in a location about 50 km from London.
It is two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything happens there is considered "height secret".
The model for this committee is 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel campaign and Mark Webber.
The Heroe of Red Bull 1 Formula, without doubt, is the recent Sebastian Vetell campaign.
Among the large technology resources that the brand of energy drinks has placed in the service of their participation in the circuits are hidden by other protagonists whose concurrence is inestimable and their nul notoriality.
The chief of the manufacture technology, Steve Nevey, that five years ago, was able to hold out that I+D progress in road cars offered 50% of the victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and the technologies are 85% of the success, while pilots have 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognises that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the informatics because "they are inevitable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own tents with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) invoked his first tend in Barcelona yesterday are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 trade network between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will compatibilize this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multimarc centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El English Court.
The President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set as an example of the remodeled tent where in the Grand Barcelonese Via, the property of Pont Reyes, with whom co-operated from 30 years ago.
The North American group has prepared a plan to place 200 market sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first in opening were Bucarest (Rumania) and Serbia (Serbia) last week, which was the third of Barcelona.
Herrero didn't want to discover the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also ensured that the filosofia to install the tents will always be the same, supported in a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the mobile design of the tents (with products that can be interactively touched) which will have a similar image in Europe.
Furthermore, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero refused to handle a system of franquisy and stressed that the trade network intends "better the customer service and the pymes in purchase, attention, powder and even the package".
The tent of Barcelona includes a space with a worldwide pilot programme that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP informal equipment in guarantee.
A online service with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Netherlands.
"So, in 10 minutes, we can solve problems that sometimes can be late until two days."
"This system is designed especially for pymes and users, since large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," he noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell set by "ropping" a million clients to their rivals in three years
More optimist than other guidelines, the delegated adviser of Bank Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the Âa, but initially rejects a new liquidity and vaticin crisis at the end of the war of the passive.
Despite this, it provides a deplomation of interest margins, which will be compensed in part with commitments and the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to catch a million particular customers in three years, its nice assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and so power to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
It will take place in 2011 a new director plan which will take a three-year viability.
The goal, in addition to surviving without need to recover the public aid of FROB, is to win a market quota with the capture of a million new customers -700,000 if those who can go out - their great dealing assignment, since he has even been more mixed to pimes and companies than to the minorist client.
This year has been captured by 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market quota is in particular 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity, or that is the same, of austerity, with a reduction of costs as a goal, and the results of which will result when the results of the exercise are present.
Poor people are attracted in these times to set up objectives and to make them public because the financial crisis has distorted all the world's plans.
Sabadell, actually, will close its Optima Director plan this year, fixed four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the situation of the markets has extended it a more exercise.
The customers who let the crash box escape will be their main goal.
In a disaster organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be a "swift and transcendental year".
The executive, actually, believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create employment," something fundamental for the super-equipment of the business, it insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of the passiv - which penalties the margins - is decreasing, the price of the risk premiums that are paying for their liquidity are already transferring to the price of the credit to compensate the fall of the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is Âl, and it will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We haven't closed the griff, but the differences are higher," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already given its network orders to limit the long-term credit and the price of the differences - see Fivedays of 22 and 27 November-.
He also recognized that the tendance of the stage now "is to upcome commitments", but " there is a framework".
The director plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not dismiss corporate operations.
Not in vain, make sure in Spain "will require greater sizes."
"The year that comes will move everything," he assured.
It describes that capital needs are "so much" and does not deny some Spanish financial asset between red numbers.
And it points that FROB can supplie the market in capture of funds before new recapapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive to the temporary close of the markets, it remained important to what some banks have been vaticinating as a new liquidity crisis.
It indicates that it cannot be issued, but in contrast to what happened in June, a short-term financing can be obtained to the rest of the crisis.
The CECA rejects a second fuzzy oil in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday that there would be an oil of box fusions and insisted again on the speed with which the resistance of the sector is being implemented.
When it started the concentration process of Spanish crash boxes, there were several responsibility that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Cajas d'Ahorros (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday that this new oil of operations would be made.
"I think the largest part of the fusions has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Civical Bank group cannot be said that it is a second round, which is adjustments."
"The majority is completely done; we may be going to 13 or 14 instead, but all the major processes have already been made and has been ticketed by the Bank of Spain, which has also cooperated very much in it," said the Director.
In statements during an extent of the Association of Equipment and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta has expressed that the concentration process is combined "with the greatest speed possible, and we must be very satisfied with how it will be done in the periods that they have not now been marked in business plans with the Bank of Spain," emphasized.
"The rate of 45 boxes with a average of 28.500 million activity volume of 17 with 75.500 million is a process that does not have a parangon in the history, reducing the number of halts to a 62% to be much larger to comply with Basilea," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta recognized that " there are a number of very little happy opinions on the lack of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what does the Spanish Bank is to remember that we have to be within the term before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of all Europe and the "proof" of the world, and assigned to those who put it on a "known error".
The Director pointed out that, within the current economic coy, "We can be very quiet" with the situation of the financial and emergency boxes, a system that has initiated a "important" concentration process and that "speeds to the most possible speed".
She also recalled that Spain was very well stopped from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established the conditions for the whole Union.
The pressure on the market has caused a double government response.
On the other hand, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures from tax reductions to pymes, regulation of private agencies for the 426 euros of aid to stops without delivery, until the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat ports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, President Elena Salgado, with the support of the President Felipe González, has joined critics to the cancer Angela Merkel for its responsibility to disappoint the current crisis.
How should we interpret those moves?
Before that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of torture in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of what the future should be, which is choosing to maintain the former traditions of good part of its partners.
With regard to European resistance, Germany begins to speculate about the three possible outcomes to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now the science seems fitting, with a very favourable view, nearly 50% of the population.
Third, a replacement of the euro, online with the major macroeconomic control sisters' proposals, budgetary rate, taxes for transit countries, possible suspension of payments from some of them and private costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and is defining from a long time, so they are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the FMI and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government took out a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed that it should be done ( fiscal and stability plans in public funds) and what they used to practice their European partners, including France.
The second in front of the Central European Country, when Merkel was penitently extended to Greece the salvation decision.
It was already critical, but the truth is that the political consciousness in Germany and public opinion and published were very contrary to Greece's redemption.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again comes with a clear position, making the reform of the Treaty of the Union, to enable the salvation of a country and, at the same time, to commit private benefits to run with the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, since it has predicted the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal has been adopted, even though it has been adopted and, in the next months, we should assist the reform process of the Union that allows those measures from 2013.
Germany has brought a red line that doesn't think of crossing.
And it tells us everyone that, although now there are measures that may not be much agreed, since that date the former function of the euro will be completed.
In 2013, the birth of a new monetary area, where infrastructure countries will be severely sanctified, may be required to be declared in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with the cost.
Germany points to us that we should follow a severe growth path with high rate of emergency and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and Property and positive external salts.
Another alternative based on the debt and construction, with a huge wallet in payment balance, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, they will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd hurt not understanding.
It is not only to rebuild public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we need is much harder.
And the worst we could do in these circumstances is to hurt ourselves.
I hope the current turbulences leave a more peaceful step.
And that we use the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the firstborn of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also understanded this and his double demonstration (the promised reforms after the last week with the large companies and the announcement of yesterday new measures) suggests that, despite the critics to Merkel, the text is opened to be ordered at home.
But the red line that Germany has brought is, and it doesn't seem to be moved.
And, among the possibilities they are considered, the abandonment of a too scarced monetary area from less serious countries cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany can always tell us that he had already warned us.
Deport and law fraude
Treatments like Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate engineering but doesn't want to escape to a sanction.
The exposure presumed by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party discussed on 23 November against Ajax in the Campeons Liga has caused to write rivers of tint about whether such behavior is or not anti-sportive and if both players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As well known, in the lack of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had clearly won), the two players lost deeply time at the time to take missing paths to cause the arbitr to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the King Madrid will end as leader of his group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction of the next part of the lift, against the Auxerre, and they will be able to pass cards to the next phase.
Finally, the EUFA disciplinary committee has sanctionsed with two parties to the team trainer, José Mourinho, and with different economic quantities for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but more frequently in the world of football.
It's so extended that it's part of the ethics, of the unscriptible, but followed rules, of this sport.
The part of the debate in the reported case should have been protagonized by a team of the Real Madrid (which in his himno assumes nobleness and honor, and sometimes has multiplied its players by analogue acts) and the orquestate dramatization, in view of Mourinho, who adds more an episode to his historic and provocant history.
In any case, the debate turns back to if this type of behaviour not expressly contrarys the principles of the sports, such as if these actions are violated by law; therefore, they are acting in respect of the sports Regulation, but it seems to be dismissed.
The question is to examine the type of damage that causes sports spirit.
One of the goods that understand the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, the aspect that with these actions has not been in danger, it is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which it is pronounced with the game is avoiding that the team of criminal players uses injustly the opposite team, what has not happened too.
However, the paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it has not been identified to what we usually characterize as a trap or fraction of law, because their violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid sanction, but exactly his action tried to be the most evident to receive the punishment of the arbitr.
They waited and accepted the sanction pleasantly.
Another question is what kind of benefit the criminals gain in the intentional deficiencies.
Here it seems to be necessary to find that it is not placed in a disadvantaged situation in the rival or benefit in the same party, because the result of the action is obviously supposed to leave the team with less players.
And it is not also a useful strategy for the next game, because the club can't count with those players.
The benefit is obviously that players will start the next phase of the Campeons Liga without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But it is a long-term benefit, with a certain degree of undetermination, because the team can be removed to the first changes, and with this action, players comply with a sanction party and pass the second card cycle, where the suspension for card acumulation is produced with less than in the first cycle.
So, by going through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not against the sports spirit, which is part of making strategic decisions that will help to take the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
Of course, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (that would be a clear case of law fraud), but they chose better to submit to it.
They took a strategic decision without sorting the punishment or flee from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is difused, in this case I think it was a clear case of engineering.
It seems that the polemic arises by two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way the transmission of the leadership was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused by the sports principles by these actions is not both ethical and estical.
Official offers to catch ships of groups in NCB
The dictature of the calendar has focused on a reserve rate for the days 16 and 17.
They proliferate the self-suffered celebrations by employees, which want to cost between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turron and the lottery, with the arrival of December, they also return the groups before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen ballon for the restoration and the oxy of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis, they have been deployed in an adjusted price offence to capture the larger customer: almost everyone wants to cost between 20 and 30 euros in prices or food, the enterprises and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete the compliance of the accountability, the calendar of this year (at the fall of Nochevie in Friday) has concentrated the requests on the week of 13 December, with the result of the date of a rate of rate reserves for days pointed (16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As it has already occurred since 2008, when they eat the stage of flakes, many companies have removed the collective stages on budgetary basis.
To avoid the tradition, many workers keep it paying for their own bottle.
Anything the coy, one and another require battle prices, confirms the President of the Barcelona Restauration Greme, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the patronal, today, does not attract to the prophetication of how the festivals of this month will be.
"The people think so much before they book."
"He wants to go out but he has the outcome warnings in the theme of prices," he states.
The business will be well "to those who give good price and good service quality," adds, and recalls that customers are tending to reduce a scale with the crisis, so the fraction in return to the 25 euros has become greater in the request.
In a survey in several center establishments, the colapse of applications for the night of 17 is found.
In the Sotteras Group, there is a authentic boom of applications for that Friday, with the presence of costs less than 30 euros, which have responded by adapting their menus to the coy, with full forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 places in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, the Fund and other), the calendar's peculiarity has brought more anticipated reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done what is impossible to maintain the same prices of the last year, with menus for all enjoyments from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AND Group, which is the case of El Mussol, Attic, Quu, and even a total of 23 locals, are maintained optimists after detecting a growth of facturation from the second semester and good, even concentrated, business perspectives for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who preserve the festivals.
Their six group menus have added a ship, with 30 euros or more, as a star budget, and the perceiving that there is a prediction to cost a 10% more than the last year in exchange of more details, such as coffee.
They also see green breaks in some companies who again invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is something greater.
By the patronal Fecasarm (including the Bares, Restaurants and Ocio of Barcelona), his President, En Gomà, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and supports that the reservations are "animated" together, although the customers "good to the maximum".
Yes, the illusion for the festivals hasn't come down, pays who pays, indicates.
The Pakistanian nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons to "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the ambassador and Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by Wikileaks Portal confirms the great concerns that cause the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
In the margin of the clarifications and detailed players that offer the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives believed in Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between both countries in the area of atomic security, rather than to go increasing, "decrease" and that the instable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a faster ritme than any other country of the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled but that they remain stored by components to difficulty destroying their attack - is one of the main reasons for discovery in Washington.
This includes the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a preliminary report on the visit of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The nearby of some nuclear installations to the Territory under the Taliban attack, the brushed spread of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and miscellaneous programmes is considered, not only by the United States but also by Russia as proliferant and reasonable to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has needed to contract personnel with strict religious convictions to protect nuclear installations; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in an age with their homologs and age.
The newest documentation filtered by the Portal of Julian Assange is the latest cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the high pakistanic climate of nuclear weapons production.
A departure of the emphasis in May, which qualifys of "fruiting" communication with Pakistan, states: "The transparency is often unexistent; the aid offers remain without response or are rejected."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, officer of the National Intelligence for South Asia, states that "in despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a faster ritme than any other country in the world".
The ambassador Patterson also requests Washington during the visit of the Chef of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, who leaves "very clear" to the responsibility that "Pakistan's Army must end with the damage support for terrorist groups".
The Chief of Wikileaks
Obama appointed a high responsibility for the anti terrorism fight to avoid new filters.
Interpol issues a red warning to follow moves and locate Assange where he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labirint where it is difficult to make sure of facts.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "localize and follow the moves" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, it is not new but that date of 20 November.
And it does not have to be considered with the last filtering of more than a quarter of million US diplomatic documents, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Moreover, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assured that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
It was the 20th day when the international police body with seat in Lyon (France) said the order at the request of Switzerland but did not show it until yesterday after the authorisation of the authorities of that country.
Thus, 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "with view to their temporary and extra arrest".
Although the Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many of the Member States have explained the organization, they consider the called new network freely to proceed to an arrest -- which must accompany the national police body, especially if they have an additional bilateral agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed as Assange.
The movement has encouraged the lawyers of Assange, who published a letter yesterday saying that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has been ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested and received permission to exit from Switzerland from the tax of its case, compared to the Mic Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin security head.
"This seems to be a chase, not a legal persecution," denied the mission.
While the world looks for him - and since his mother's defense the innocentness of his son-- Assange continues in an unknown garden, but not silent.
The Monday has granted an interview from an undetermined place to the director of the Time magazine to Skype, a conversation in which he asked the US State Secretariat, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering diplomatics and responsibility to explain in the United Nations by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should be released."
Her opinion was denied by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, yesterday, who qualified of "ridiculate and absurd" the request for demission.
"I'm not sure why you should import a guy's opinion with a web page," he said to the CNN string.
The own Obama has acquired a high responsibility for the anti-Terrorist fight, Russell Travers, to prevent new document flights.
The aim of President Barack Obama to remain important to Assange is contrary to opinions that these days are published by political and conservative comments.
Peter King, the Congressist who from January will preside the National Security Committee in the low Chamber, has requested the State Department to study the possibility of include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and to provide funds and to any of them of any contribution or assistance".
More far than Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to turn back after saying that Assange should be killed.
"Obama should make it gone and use an untrusted plane or something."
Who was not excused was Mike Huckabee, baptism minister, Arkansas exhibitor and possible candidate to the president.
"Whoever in the Government has filtered information is guilty of delivery and anything that is not the execution would be a too nice punishment," he stated in the Fox string.
Puigcercos seek peace in ERC with guineas to the barriers in Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the receipt to sort the eighth internal revolt in the ERC lines, without north for the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware that its discharge cover is inadequate for the exhibitor of Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today so diluted as its own mentor and that it can absolutely cause the headbreaks that he had with other extinct flowers.
Therefore, the Leader of the Left will win new critics with guineas that allow him to blind up to municipal elections.
For the first time, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers could be pronounced on their continuity in secret.
By papers, not by hands up.
If the carodists want to carry a certain chastisement vote to the President, they can do it without fear.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the division image as well as the subjection to his person.
In several interviews, he suggested that it would not be considered by half one of the votes, but added, without the need of percents, that it would not be a good result of "the bullgar".
The neighbors of Carod require the President something more than to put their charges in the military, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercos controls the maximum body between conventions.
But if you do not have the majority enough to force divisions, they will agree with the executive a road sheet from here to May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the strategic reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the national Council on 18th day.
Its intention is to assess Puigcercos instead of promised to promote the 2011 convention at October, something that it already gives.
The leader of ERC recognized that the "polyphony" threatens stability and that its goal is to make, once for all, the organization is able to lay the sucking of doors inside.
In this line, the article that Josep Huguet conseller in functions signed in his blog.
As regards the Ideologist of Puigcercos, the Title of Innovation said that the leader will be refreshed "the change of various goals".
And he numbered five, of those two.
The first, "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the military, which includes new faces that come from the Afián sector to Carod.
The second can be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidates the assembly once as a functioning mechanism.
It therefore proposes a reform of the statutes that allows the conventions to celebrate the delegates chosen by suffrage.
Finally, the assembly model, an incidence in the Spanish game system, has been an intervention of the Puigcercos team, which has already been battled in this sense at the last two conventions.
In fact, the 2008 convulsed conviction left the responsibility to review the assembly at a specific reform congress.
This appointment remains urgent because the internal sea of the last years was unconscious to address the matter.
Now, without critical sectors at appeal, it may be a good time to recover it and close it forever.

Manage China objectives to reduce inver efficiency gases
The representative of that country in the COP16 assured that its country has made great efforts to reduce the carbon gate and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce for 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its emission of inver-effective gases.
China maintains its offer to reduce between 40 and 45 per cent its emission of inver-effective gases to 2020, assured its Wei, representative of that country in the COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the United Nations March Convention on Climate Change (COP16), its Wei assured that his country has made great efforts to reduce carbon bullet and to restore its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, its country has invested $245 million in the efforts to reduce the gas emission of inver-effect.
However, it clarified that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this matter.
It remarked that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four headings: dialogue; capacity building; institutions and pilot programmes.
In all these rules, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which collects the objectives set for reduction of gases, explained.
On the other hand, it highlighted that the Federal authorities in China have worked coordinatedly with the states and locals to achieve the energy pollution objectives, energy use and reduction.
Moreover, they are running, or have already concluded several multiannual plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, the Energy Efficiency Usage Programme, implemented during the last five years and received investments from the United Nations, the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincy project of climate change, another for the change of incandescent focus by ahorrors and one more mixing and adaptation, detailed.
On the same table, Martin Krol, Scientist of the Government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than generally thoughts.
For example, exposed, the emission by cap cap captain of inver-effect gas in China is six tonnes per person, while in the United States is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of historical contribution to pollution.

Added to legality exposure from Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panic leader has the right to join the Commission of National Order to claim what he agrees to.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exemption of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the ex-panist manager has the right to join the Commission of National Orden to claim what he agrees to.
In a preliminary interview of Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as the Governor of the State, he said that the exposure of Espino in any case is a decision taken in the local area.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Committee on the Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to, in the case of the case, take advice to the Committee on the Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent authority," he noted.
On the other hand, he claimed that it was not time to think in 2012 and that it never had been an alian for the presidential candidature.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, where it will be chosen to its successor.
"This (a covenant in 2012) is a subject that never was in the negotiation table, at least not for now, was a planning for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he refused.
The Panist leader needed to support the PAN 71 years of dialogue, thus "not for us the internal competition; to the counterpart "We enjoy it and strengthen us", he claimed.
He said that the counsel will certainly be able to choose the best or the best leader to the National Action for the following three years, which will deliver the staff "to whom the counsel determines".
"I have that absolute tranquillity and opening, any of the five would be proud to deliver the Office of the President of the party."
He announced that the record recorded by the party in the last elections of 4 July will be reflected in the following contents, although "no time is yet to think in 2012."
"For now it's about to join the Governor Gabino Cue in this task."
In this context, he highlighted that the three alliance governments in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the reason for observation throughout the country, that "much hopes, anhels are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of the expectations".
In question of the Criticals of the PRI to President Felipe Calderon for its talk within the four years of his government, César Nava called the prisoners to reflect on the sex of the former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the Prince thinks that Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than Fox and Calderon; that they began to defend them; that comes out of the closet," he said.
He thought that the holder of the Federal Executive could make expressions such as those that he made in his speech in the National Auditory, because there is no weakness or much less censure in the country.
Promote Obama in Twitter law for undocumentated students
"If you agree that approving the Dream Act Act is the approach, call your senators and install them to approve is a legislation," said the president to be established in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama was summarized today to the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumentated students, with a personal message of the social Twitter network.
"If you agree that approving the Dream Act Act is the next, call your senators and install them is a law," obama Twitter.
His short message keeps open a cybernetical link with a broader document requesting the public to communicate immediately with the Senators, since the vote of legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to happen quickly, now is the time to make your voice listen," he states.
The message was reported after the 42 Republican Senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the exemption of the tax expenditures of Bush's age and the financing of the Government is approved.
Such blocking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the republican blocking to the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs believed that when I resolved the fiscal topic, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be fixed.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the fiscal matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can achieve an agreement at some time in that, and then we can plan the rest's sequence," he said.
The leader of the democrate majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that would request a "vote of debat" for the Dream Act, thus the initiative to legalize undocumentated students could be voted from the next June in the Senate, although it is more and more in the next week.
The Senatoral Version of the Dream Act or the American Sweden Act would legalize about 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the 16 years, remained in the country in the last five years and entered a higher education institution or military.
However, the parties repeat 60 votes to approve the initiative, thus repealing the concurrence of a pump of republicians, while partial organizations of the project protagonize an intense cabilleo to ensure the approval of the law.
Democrates, most of whom the Dream Act supports, have 58 scans.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, said that he would vote against, and only a republican has expressed his support to the law, Richard Logar de Indiana.
Thus, the Participants of the Dream Act repeat the summary of several republicians in the case that other democrats decide to deal with the initiative.
Among the most covered Republicans are the Senators of 日e, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outcome Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicians who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Haʹ, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hu
Another republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the Representative Chamber has a different version, the analysis coincide with the Dream Act's most obstacles in the Senate.
They put their finger on the lake
The second round of The Places of the Language was a passport where the participants made the story galaxy
"What about the sex in the language I understand, but... is the finger in the laga? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of the Places of the language, cycle that feasts the Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of his question (in another ferry the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, explained).
The finger in the laga... "seat us in appreciation," the argentin writer looked sweetly to the public, most of young people, quoted in the International Fear of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderated table by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great account, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "laga" is, is from medical doctor, which does not receive answers, even though it's tracks in the same story.
Of the infectionologist is convinced: "Patience is not my strong, perhaps my laga."
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the traumatolog who stole his alient in half of the pail, but who claims that it is not a scientist term; it is the psychoanalist who reveals mystery: "the laga is the real open, the sympathic is the cicatriz".
The protagonist suspected alivious and concluded "of the laga only I realize that it is the real open and that it doesn't exist" but convinced that the pleasure and the traps of the language should be very interviewed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaranse Sergio Ramírez also expressed a pleasant story that entitled Elogio of the invention, where the finger in the lake is not appointed but at a moment it is discovered.
With magic reality pincels, accounting of a huge hechicera, that was the same that touched clouds, he brought from turn to men who had gone far or repaired the things that had lost a palace, the story that returned to speak later America, the big news to which he didn't miss from the beginning his own cronistes that told her and quoted her to Bernal Díaz of the Castillo who criticised the exposures of the captains of the conquistors.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) made a bully of the finished witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in other ways it would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that he missed until the poor."
However, he highlighted "so the fools and the embusters who best imagine" and it is where it converge reality and lies, where it is no longer known that it belongs to a band or to another, where the fiction of fiction reaches its apogeo.
It's actually called the "tra" ceremonia.
"For her inheritance, we are what it's counting."
In its turn, writer Mayra Montero attracted and applauded the variety of interpretations to which the FIL's invitation was made with its table around The finger in the laga.
The Cuban-Puertorique pointed its attention to the great lack of social violence through its country - and the Latin America-product of traffic and drug sales disputes.
"I believe that goodness, good poesy, good songs will conclude a tactic commitment that, of course, is not premed," she indicated, after quoting that the reality of the Property is the communication and dimension of the commitment between authors and readers, and that in a "chemic reaction" of this last.
The night he closed the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also enfasised "of that finger on the side of the committed writer".
He felt that in a world that lives quickly, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness that reduces in dogmatisms, “they have a little no and behind every negative. ”
"To be owners of our thinking and to be owners of the reality we have to kill: and killing means many times putting the finger in the lake and mourning those who are much more comfortable thinking in the carcature, in white and black, in established and unmatched ideas, and mourning also the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he invited to recover the sense of writing.
Roman is going by his first title
Ruben Omar Romano has been able to find three losses at the end, he has had highlights in his career, but he has learned to reach the decisional series at three times.
With the dust of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are also two different styles marked by their technicals, which are among themselves with a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano accounts with three wounds at the end, he has had highlights in his career, but he has learned to reach the decisive series at three times, even though it has gone in white until now and therefore this occasion is very special for him.
The argentin has completed comfort with the medalla of the subcamp, a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consequent ends.
The sanctuary strategy reached its first end as a trainer in the Torneo Opening 2002, when he was carrying the Morelia's rands with which he fell globally from 4-2 to Toluca; then, in 2003, he also reached the decisionful distress and also lost it with a total of 3-1 and was exactly before Rayados.
Now with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentenario Torneo 2010, again before the Devils, Ruben suffered a reveal again, since his team ended 2-2 in front of the shooters after 210 minutes of game, but in the penaltis tank he was put in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 rotation.
Ruben has already lost two ends with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he doesn't want to run the same happiness, seeking to separate from the malicious and ability to celebrate a title for the first occasion, although it is the most important institution for him.
"I want to get out of the campaign, I don't want to break any statistics, this is by a club, for a affair to which I deserve, and therefore the title will come for me, but the previous is the most important thing," said the Tinel when he asked about the numbers that you have against playing finals.
Very vigent has the previous end, which, safely, has been very much, "the only learning we can have is that until the arbitr is the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the ray, also the players, because at the previous time, with two penalties to carry out we were already ready to run and I think that this is a learning, until the game ends we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal trends, something that doesn't care for you, because he trusts his players: "Even never seeks to reach the penalty tank, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there's no other, and it must be prepared, in the previous tour, we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad playing the destination, sometimes by nerves or anxiety to have the title in our hands, but if we had gone, it left us something for this end that we hoped not come to that instance."
Romano has in his hands noticed to be a subcampoone technology and for the first time trying the glory that gives the titles.
EU changes the rules to obtain visa
Persons must attend the Service Centres for Visa Requests before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be less as well as the time of waiting.
Since 10 January 2011, it will change the procedure for transmission of a visa in the United States and Consular Embajad.
With the new procedure, the majority of the applicants must access to the Visa Inquiries Centres (ASC, for their English Sections) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASCB staff shall take the biometrical information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before interview.
The new procedure will have certain benefits for aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be less, it will no longer be necessary to carry out a payment to concert the citation, another payment to process the request for visa and another more to provide the document.
The aspirant will only carry out a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for cases of views with request (being visa for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for commercial and investors.
Persons who want to renew their visa will not have to come to a interview with the Consular Office, but only to accuse the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their shoes.
Since biometrical information will be taken in the ASC, the applicants who repeat a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain less than in the past.
Similarly, those who request visa in the Consulats in City Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the additional service tariff of $26.

He'll announce NASA foreign life finding
The Space Agency quoted the press to present a finding tomorrow that will cause an impact on the search of living persons in the space.
The National Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will provide to meet tomorrow, Thursday, astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is an alien life.
The finding will be presented in a press road tomorrow at Thursday at the 13th hour of the NASA seat in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In citing the press, the NASA assured that "a finding that will cause an impact on the external life search", which has occurred in experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures for our couple and in enemy environments that were thoughtful, and they would put on the table the possibility of being intelligent as humans if they improve the conditions they live.
It seems to be a microbio found in the Mono Lake Fund in the Josemit National Park, California, where it lives in a environment that was too venerous for any way of life, since the sea is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creation uses arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life might exist on other planets, which have no benevolous atmosphere.
It is astrobiological, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "yes there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will provide the real achievement of findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
At the conference, the Geobiolog Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life in March, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the Scientists students Titan (the greatest moon of Saturno), will participate under the perspective that its chemical is similar to the earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and 'lock' pattern or
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, from the arrival of 'bipartidism', they claim.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when a Block or a Âper at the Congress, headed by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who was declared independently, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the "bipartidism" to the House.
Before starting the 60-year-old Leislature session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and the Mountalvo Patron, "tronava" against the reform of the Organic Law, as he excluded them.
With this reform, they repeatedly started by the "bipartidism" because they will now be two persons, of the same number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinate of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board Directive, headed by the Salvador López Brito Panel and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as their President.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that these reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the next days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to amend the scheme, with a political will, and if they do not have it, they will be repeated by both parties and the coalition or the coalition will be completed.
"This is here (the coalition or the coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from any decision, or if they have the political difference to consider the rest's opinion."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, from Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are complying with a multilateral group.
It was not allowed to allow the Congress after being monopolic, now being "duopolic".
"It is not the spirit of reform to the law that has a eternal bipatidism in the Congress."
For the beginning, this group is starting with five legislators, and they are talking with other companions and companions to be more, the convergence has increased.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that the Congress has now become a "botin" between two, as an allusion to PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're dividing it between two."
Pattern Montalvo, requested respect for the personality of the lawyer, gave him its place in the negotiations tables.
"What is not by cupular agreements, we are left out to 5 that we are probably going to make nine Members, now the five who see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify ourselves to seek a place in the negotiation table, that is the subject that in the reform they made that they agreed, we are outside and we are not agreed with that reform."
$200 billion more for "the test"
Pay Adjunction of Mazatlán another cheque to the questioned ownership of the material company.
A more for a little more than 200 thousand weights for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Ajuntage.
With this, the amount paid in this second semestre to the property of the material undertaking is up to 1 million 200 thousand weights.
According to the Municipal transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last 16 November, by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 weights, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts for payment".
The Tesorer Luis Miguel López Moreno had enhanced more money from the Community for this test, which was observed by the Supreme Revision of the State for sale to a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that has yet been committed to him and, therefore, how many more cheques are missing to be issued for Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased, it is just paying you what it must, as the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The latest checks "represented" in the last trimestre of the year: 24 September, 2 of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October, and this last of 16 November.
Although the evidence has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, such as the Law notes when a company is questioned by the ASEA, in order to avoid other governments using their services, the Treasury assures that they have not been back to use their services.
The previous, following that, on 25 July, Northwest published a review to the cheques issued by the Assembly to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, in the Trinity of the Alcalde Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipio over 10 million weights to 42 Czech.
He also performed transactions with Jumapam, where he covered cheques for more than 3 million weights.
Urgency to find tourist sites
Tourist undertakers lament the accident of the foreign tourist for bad conditions of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a disturbance of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán requested the authorities to take attention to the areas and sites that are in bad state and to project a bad picture of the gate.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Trade Association of the Dorada Zone Commerce, recalled that at times they claimed to take care of the image of the destination and to return the evil that the tourists find with new activities or paths.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the bankets has affected because the tourists are coming to pass and see the destruction and take the turn to nearby business.
"The politicians don't know what it's to close a company on a day and have no idea of the dinar that loses, or, in contrast, they will not do works in such ways in both time and without the debt planning."
Hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Ayunting.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid it again, how to do it because it gives preventive maintenance and not only falls in the corrective," he expressed.
"We are desirable to enjoy a city, because not only because of being tourist area, the maintenance must be given, but as a resident we deserve a place to live and the Assembly must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that also look at disturbances and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito of Mazatlán.
" Today, to come the tourist is not only depending on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has a place in its beaches, in its availties, permanent maintenance in what the tourist attractives are," he said.
"The debt attention has not been given, and this type of facts shows something that is notorial for all, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsekretary of Turism Promotion, expressed that it is urgent to rescue tourist sites in Mazatlán because they are not used correctly and are projected a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be set online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city daily, ordered, and to be attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Freely Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that will have to order first, hold and set us online to make them attractive to be able to summarize them in the inventar that we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results to the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed Members to assume the great responsibility to be an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges he has.
A valuable and free work legislation of agreements between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that has great problems.
Since yesterday, 60 legislation, integrated by seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alianza Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which sums a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations of the new integrants of the State Congress is that they are able to perform a strict and committed management with the society and the various sectors that are responsible for a legislative work and that the same patterns of partidism or parentalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Empresarial Coordinator Council, proposed that the recent 40 members of the State Congress assume the great responsibility to be an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges he has.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right, free agreements between parties because it is usual that they make arrangements to protect their own interests and become carnavals of the Governors and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
It said that they certified the commitment to establish the needed powers that they take forward to the Governing Board.
"We want you to do a dignity work, especially committed with society and sectors because they were the synagogues who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, believed that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to empower and summarize forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because the economic situation today is very complicated.
"The most important is that they emphasize economic growth, which generates incentives for investment and infra-investment, and that will somehow promote the generation of employment."
With regard to tourist activity, he requested the new legislators to give him the weight that it revises within the State budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with less budget and that it is inconsistent as important economic activity and generates dividends and investments and that it directly competes with the industrial agriculture."
In addition to the labelling of resources to detonating tourist projects and co-operating to provide security to the state and update to the Law of Alcohols that have not been able to resolve in previous legislation.
A magic king is searched
Women, cars and bicycles, among other players, are the bridge of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For your parents, the next Day of Reyes will be difficult to please your illusions, because your home is complied with nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a shive.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph John and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Balthazar give them the players and the clothing they want.
The family lives a humble house of the Salvador Allende Colonia and lives on the day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"It's sometimes hard to see her because my husband doesn't have a call, but we'll sell mandarine and dad... I'm going with the "plebes" to sell the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, a 4-year-old, wants a moon or a bicycle, while his sister Isabel, three-year-old, would like a barbie-boat.
For her part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has aspired from a long time to have a "monster" car and for his brother Jesus, who was 8 months old, Cayetana suggests a clothing for a year.
"He said to me (Josee Alfredo), "I want this monster," but I told him, "Come to see the son," because he was very face," he remembered with tristeness Cayetana.
For elderly children, who were at school, clothing and calcium, would be the ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, is tailed 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is 10 years old, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses eight.
Joseph Juan, who was 14 years old, missed tennis, so a pair of five and a half or six would be a lot of help.
If you want to help really do the dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family children, you can participate in the campaign Search for a King Mago, giving a player or effective player in the Northwest receipt.
Forty-four-year-old drug traffickers arrested
Wednesday, in Estria, a decade of persecution in the context of the dismantlement of a production and sale network of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested that will be made to various accusations.
Consequences have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where drug production was performed.
"Cannabis plants have been covered about 750, four kilograms of hachis, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security Porter.
In total, 11 men and three women have been arrested, including the two leaders of the network, two Sherbrooke men.
The prisoners had to appear in the Sherbrooke justice palace in the next hours after their arrest.
Cannabis' production accusations could be addressed, in particular, with the purpose of trading, comploiting and covering services.
These persecutions have been produced after a long research that has dured about a year.
"The information provided by the public has allowed us to carry out arrests," Mr. Ruel needs.
In this police operation, about seventy agents of the Stereo Research Module for the Security of Quebec, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Department of Memprémagog police.
Can be fighted against clandestinity without problems
The draft law of conservators that, as the Government is, should solve the problem of Clandestin fathers loaded, will certainly be a great opposition, since the three parties of the opposite have announced the midnight that they could not support it.
"I'm primarily based on the Card."
"I meet here with a party that has created the grain that you have found," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the lawyers after the weekly celebration of the cacus.
Liberals determine that the draft law in their current form, which would allow any person to stop until one year from a ship identified as transport of Clandestin immigrants, infringes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the law project because he pointed to the wrong white.
"We are against and, it seems, all parties of opposition are against the project, so we will see what the Government does," Mr Duceppe said.
The NPD's criticism in the area of immigration, Olivia Chow, has made the criticisms that indicate that their party is not sufficiently firm with Clandestin immigrants.
"The Neodemocrates agree that measures are adopted against the debtors of clandestin fathers, and that is what we intend with another draft law, C-35," states Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the draft law of the conservators because he attacks the repositories and catches the children for at least one year," explains Ms. Chow.
The Ministry of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and to avoid the will of the Canadians.
"The great majority of the Canadians say to the lawyers that do not tolerate this type of clandestination, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a felpud."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a trust vote on its draft law, which could bring the country to elections as a consequence of its EEC.
However, a conserver has communicated to the QMI Agency that the Government would request the conclusion of a vote so that each Member who will be opposed would be later explained to his electors.
The new unit does not receive uniqueness
Although there was announced the possibility of creating a permanent unit of fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public consultation committee on this issue.
The Ministry of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been established two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Research in New York has been issued since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Thus, the announcement of Tuesday has been shot by surprise to more than one.
It should be said that, during a responsibility of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec held last 29 October, this measure has never been discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
That was enough to deal with the criticians of the party who are concerned about the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, this announcement is qualified as "a bond out of the chister" and as "a chaptery solution for last hour".
The Ministry of Dutil has, by its part, answered to those fearing that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," simply indicates.
"We are conscious of this problem."
For the Chairman of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, there is nothing that can suggest the establishment of a public investigation.
"How much more Mr. Charest prevents the creation of this research committee, more people are our opinion, meaningly, he has something to hide," explains.
"The only way to have a research committee is with Jean Charest's dimission," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National Public Administration School.
To get out of this dead point, it suggests Quebec to provide a special mandate to the general interventor to carry out an investigation on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general interventor," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the interventor the same competences as a Commissioner, allowing the persons to testify.
The creation of a permanent table is not the only project in cereals in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to modify the criminal code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request seems to be from the tax of the Marteau Operation, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigations.
The Federal Ministry of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed by its part that his homolog of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this subject.
The 2001 Primavera Operation related to moter groups, although the criminal code was not adapted, 131 were arrested.
Later, Ottawa impulsed the adoption of the Law on the gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme monitoring
Various water courses are monitored closely because of the strong precautions registered in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
Wednesday afternoon a land running in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, they have been evacuated from houses.
On the night, there was another land running in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
There was a road.
Since Tuesday to Wednesday, several regions have registered strong precautions, between 40 and 70 miles of rain.
Furthermore, between 20 and 40 miles from now until Thursday, depending on the region, are expected.
The sectors northern the River and the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 miles of rain.
Since these prescriptions are taken to the delay of the snow that has already been acumulated in certain sectors, it is afraid that several rivers are broadcast.
On midnight, the civil security unit of Quebec issued warnings for the Ureau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jerón, in the Laurentides, and from Chéne, in Lotbinière, have already caused inundations in the past and are under supervision.
In Lanaudière's region, strong precautions have caused some lakes to be broadcast in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the strong rain has drawn a temporary pool.
As a measure of prevention, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the cross-border of certain lakes has caused the closure of several ways, especially in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality.
The civil security unit continues to be warned and monitors the neighborhood situation, Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Provision Centre of Quebec growth, by its part, issued the midnight announcements by communicating the strong growth of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Culpan Partly in Dupont
The Quebec Stéphane Dupont radio presenter has suffered a certain reveal before the Canadian Council of the Radio Television Standards (CCNR) by controversed statements concerning social assistance and haitian as well as its green language in the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and its CHOI team 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inexacted information on social assistance, an unrequired negative representation of haitian and green languages that should not be used in divisions during the day".
The Council also pointed out that the debates on suicide, including the interpretation of the name of two persons who had been suicided, do not violate the radiodiffusion codes.
The CCNR had received several frauds in relation to the comments made in disseminated comments between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a break from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group was deceived that the quantities mentioned in the emission were not correct.
The presentors must communicate confidential data and not that lead to falsehood.
In relation to suicide, Stéphane Dupont had shown that suicide was a cobarde act.
Most of the members of the Committee have concluded that the transmitted message was that selfishness should not be considered as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of Dupont le midi have treated a delicted issue in a proper and appropriate way."
Consequently, any fault has been rejected in this regard.
The last claim was referring to the declarations made after Haiti's earthquake.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had protagonized a median employment that had raised many reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donation to help the Haitians because he couldn't know safely if the needed would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that its cumulative effect is an unnecessary negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already completed my suspension three days up there."
"My expedition has been held a half years ago," said the representative.
In all decisions, the Committee denied the emission of green language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio string has cooperated "better than required".
The consequences will be minimum for the fabrik, which, among other things, should be announced once in the greatest audience hours within a period of three days.
A king of the Kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian surroundings of Nacereddine Zemmal has had a extremely peculiar resort.
The athlete, which points in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, ascends to the tattoos and rings of the world seeking new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 to progress at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground that involve mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The atleta, who works as a security agent and employer of the UPS firm, has recently given bad news to its rivals, wining two gold medallas in the World Amateur Campeonate of the World Karate and Kickboxing Propertyion (WKA), celebrated from 23 to 30 October in Edimburg.
"I won in the category of kickboxing full contact and thai box," he explained.
"I'm currently prepared to participate in the World Coup of Shooting in China."
"There will invite sports who have ended between the four first posts in the last world campaign in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I ended the turnover in fifth place, but I reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I went progressing in every competition."
"In this pass, I'll be the first time this time or the year that comes!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating from China in which it is allowed to go up with the pounds and feet, as well as to lay the opposers on the ground.
The placements are originally celebrated on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most amazing pugilist in this kind of fight is the American vietnamite Cung Le origin, largely recognised in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only keep a competition in his career, he will certainly accuse the big turnee "King of Sanda", the Super Bo of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the most noble and prestigious of China," explains the famous boy.
"It's like the equivalent to Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"There was an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won its first fight, in the semifinals of its category (80 kg), but has lost at the end.
"He who has won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semifinal winners are at the end of their category."
"The campaigns of each category are then to crown a single campaign, the King of Kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without claims
Hydro-Quebec has granted direct contracts for a value of $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
In the center of this evaluation of more than hundred contracts, there is a consortium for BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has received without a claim before the most important contract, the management of the project, for a total of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy gerance, was created in 2004 by the decision of Hydro-Quebec to trust the private sector its responsibility to manage this important project of 5.000 million dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Gerance consortium obtained the profitable contract without a previous public invitation.
For the Partie, the resource to business consortiums is a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and providing prices.
"This is a new method of colussion and to eliminate competition."
"It means, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said the Deputy of the Partie Quebecse Sylvain Simard yesterday on a press road.
More early, Mr Simard asked the question in the National Assembly because it does not understand how it can benefit public interest in this way.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, answered afternoon, refusing firmly that a confusion had been made with this contract.
"Empire to cansarme," she protested, defending that the PQ had acted "deshonestly" and "with lack of rigor".
He signed that "the minimum" would be that the PQ would be forgiven.
The formula of consorcius is a common practice in the world.
Normally, it is a covenant with a temporary limit that allows two or several companies to group their knowledge to respond to an invitation for a complete project.
The Eastmain project provides a high level of fullness, taking into account the size of works.
The works have already been started and will take up until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been granted without entering competition; it has been negotiated.
Moreover, the formula of consortiums has stopped to be the imprisonment of the standard in Quebec, even for simple projects.
As published last week Le Devoir, the formula of consortiums in the technical advice sector is subject to research in the Government.
A quick view of Quebec's market record allows you to identify more than 200 consorts, of which some seem to be permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau works in association with the majority of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are decades of them, leads to one single legal person, namely, Dessau.
As regards Energy gerance consorption, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Bahía James responses to a specific work dynamic and Hydro-Quebec responses specifically to her since the 1970s".
The large head of the project Eastmain, Real Laporte, the Energy Society of Baie James (SEBJ), has made an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the draft management contract has been directly granted.
"If you answer an invitation and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact the actors of the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"The idea is, however, that what is important is not the price, but the competition of people," Mr Laporte said.
The contract granted to the Energy Gerance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received by the Partie.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After checking, Levoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to enterprises or their branches, in particular geotics.
SNC-Lavalin has received 22 contracts, Genivar consequent 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy Gerance.
All contracts were negotiated.
Totally, $449.783.344, including the Energy Gearance contract of $295.13.564.
Sylvain Simard has understood that the four companies who form consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "good known by the Liberal Party of Quebec".
The Minister Normandeau has allowed that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "financing it" before it needs that it is better than its leaders.
Required consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptic.
The consumer is only trusted in sustainable development operators, as well as on the right trade marks, and on the ecological certificates to guide their elections.
It is the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is still worse. The consumer is summarized in a medium-sized universe where messages are pulling messages that determine a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and believes that it even distorts its commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of products called "socially responsible" in 2010, chebequens seem to give very little credit to those who sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of enterprises or the publicity of them, reveal the tool of me designed by the Observatory of the Consumer of the University of Sherbrooke.
Other conclusion: The half of the consumers doubts the reliability of the official certificates that bring the rightly called products, as well as the credibility of the products and labels that carry labels indicating that they are "equivalent", states the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14,6% of the Quebecans are seriously taken to the political talks on this issue.
In any case, information on the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently sustained by nearly one third of the cheese consumers.
In fact, the laguns and the doubtful character of the information make 46% of the consumers want this option.
It is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, one third of the Chebequens also say to disapproval the proposed performances of the ecological products or services they are sold.
On the other hand, nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the marking of one or several products to respect their convictions.
A 61% has given priority to purchases in the tents of his bar and has preferred buying foods cultivated in its region, states the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum of 100 this year), the Quebec Consumer Homo loves to occupy the position of the king of the recycling that implies to reduce its impact on the environment is the protection of the fauna.
However, the Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be of doors (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of the Chebequens indicated that they used public transport or have had a car to defend their principles.
Furthermore, 39.1% of the participants of this broad behavior investigation, which just completed their first and §, supports the use of the bicycle and stage movements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, whom they have requested to engage financially in the recovery of eXcentris cinema compliance, accepts cooperating, but only through a loan.
The Development Society and the Parallelle, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic completion in the Saint-Laurent bulletin and to give him a real cinema vocation, did not get what they requested.
The Government has accepted to be involved in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would actually be lower than the initial expectations; it could constitute a sustainable solution in advantageful conditions, at least in view of certain public employees.
Quebec had already increased the early past a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then, the applications have been reviewed at the lower.
The President of the Cultural Development Society (SODEC), François Macerola, managing the eXcentris issue, sent a proposal and a action plan to the Ministry of St-Pierre.
He has sent her a last report a decade ago.
However, the SODEC received an opposite proposal from the office on Tuesday.
The Parallele and 日us have a period until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the possibility of a State donation should be completely dismissed.
We recall that the Association of Film Room owners and full films in Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support eXcentris recovery, argumenting that the Ministry of Culture should not finance immobiliar projects, since it did not do it with other cinema rooms.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector claim a significant economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of it, has taken for ten years the charge of the author cine in its places of the full, after finance of its own building, which could justifie a derogation by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films resulted patent in Montreal and eXcentris had known to trust her client.
The company and the Parallèle, addressed by Christian Yaccarini, encourage a private funding campaign, expecting to gather $700,000 to open the way to the acquisition.
Since 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallelle continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next 27 February, projecting the precious movie of Xavier Beauvois "Des men and gods".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not been contacted with Le Devoir and we don't know what he and his group of proposals have received.
It's rising up the flat of Canada completed...
The new diplomatic and diplomatic cables of WikiLeaks show what the United States consider as the completion of the Canadians in relation to the andes, but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of these last ones to Canada.
The diplomatic and diplomatics are surprised that Canadian electors do not think of the United Canadian relations when they will vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative Government to ensure that its budget is approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the ambassador and Ottawa and Washington that have been published yesterday offer more detailed games than actually substantial content.
A cable of 22 September 2008, which is, during the full federal electoral campaign, relates to what point the United States do not enter into the issues discussed by the political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the ambassador and sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations on this situation.
"The political leaders may be conditioned by a total of lowerness practically inherent to Canadians at the time of dealing with daily home issues, rather than to leave such elections to the United States (as during the campaign on the free trade of 1988). "
Therefore, it concludes that the United States are "the proverb elefant of this election: all-president, but potentially too dangerous to talk about him."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "couraging silence" because both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Lógically, I think, the capacity of a candidate, of a party and, even more, of the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which electors should think at the time of voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed by Terry Breese sent on 22 January 2009 in Ottawa to prepare President Barack Obama for its first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will contribute to ensure the super-government during the vote of confidence to the beginning of February on the Federal Budget, through which Canada will first register deficit in the last decade due to a plan of recovery of $30,000 to $40,000," wrote Mr Breese.
Nowhere is mentioned that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition of it or that the parties of the opposite had granted its super-quality to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication from January 2008 signed by the Wilkins ambassador warns to Washington on the more negative image that transmits the dramatic series distributed in the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the emission of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where small subtil references are made to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or even to the square to make the ≥100 inquiry energy.
Another cab notes that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French homolog Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to join some prisoners in Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered that he was, but he depended on "on each case".
At the end of the year, they wrote "the State Secretariat has given a document concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat accepted revising the issue."
Finally, we can mention that the animations have been warm about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a very close adviser to Stephen Harper, declared in the CBC radio that the responsible for this massive flight should be "smorded".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee's echo.
A global plan to renew ilumination
Yesterday, the United Nations has proposed a plan for renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial ilumination in hundred countries to reduce inver-effective gases (GEI) in Cancún in a number that corresponds to a third of the additional reductions that must be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is focused on the summary of large concrete projects that the United Nations expects to be adopted in Cancún to compensate the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
The incandescent bombs, which still monopolise between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by fluocompact bombs or, even better, by electrolunic diodes bombs (DEL or "LED" in English), would be avoided a large part of the 1.800 million GEI tonnes (Gt) issued on the planet for human isolation.
Ilumination is responsible for 8% of the world's employment.
It is the equivalent to 70% of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, the major countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, committed with voluntary reduction plans that should be reduced by the global GEI levels from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that quantity should be reduced to stabilize the increase of temperatures in two degrees to avoid discontrolling.
In the incandescent bombs, 95% of the energy is divided in the form of warmth and the rest, as well as 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bombs, energy expenditure is reduced to 75% and with the new LED bombs, the energy consumption is still decreased two times more.
Fluocompact bombs take an average of 6.000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, such as the Philips manufacturer this week (a company who has also participated in the United Nations study), have a life hope of 25,000 hours and consume a 80% less energy than an incandescent bomb, which allows us to make an idea of the emergency that can be achieved with the substitution plan that would be applied in hundred countries.
These new bombs can also work with resistance and emit very little warm.
On the top, they don't contain anything of mercury.
Various specialists have shown their reservations in relation to fluocompact bombs, since they contain mercury and that they should be removed as dangerous residues, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers set instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of emission of mercury on the planet is not fluocompact bombs, but the temperatures of carbon, which emit a large quantity of mercury to produce electricity that is disrupted with incandescent bombs.
Only in the United States, those centrals issue 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report describes the benefits that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would be acquired of this way of billion dollars per year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, meaning that the equivalent to 3.5 term centres which would cost 2.500 million.
Cost of Marfil expects anxiety to announce electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested the " immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Coast of Marfil, since the fixed terms have expired.
"The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent electoral committee to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," highlights a leader of the United Nations.
"Put all Costa de Marfil partys and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to avoid any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exercised by some foreign governments, the electoral committee has allowed the date of midnight to midnight without publishing the results, three days from Sunday scrutiny.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the period, the President of the EIB had commented on the television that the committee was "continuing working" to announce the results.
Wednesday has been multiplied in the world the requests that the CEI finally proclaimed the name of the winner of the second tour between Laurent Gbagbo output and its or her or her Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo band takes account of the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) from the failure of the State fight in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Costa de Marfil, has said that the intimidation of the electors held by the UN in the north of the country had dismissed the followers of the president out to vote.
All elections could be canceled if the Constitutional Council accepts the consequences presented by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo opposers believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since it is guided by Paul Yao N'Dré, a nearby political alien of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north that dismisss any relationship with the former rebellion, has judged "inacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and requested Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to revenge the victory.
Its aliens claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has made a burden before the Constitutional Council after he had prevented the electoral committee from spreading the results would be illegal.
The second turn of the presidency, on Sunday, had to have put the lead to the process of reconciliation and reconciliation of a divided country in two years ago.
The United Nations have warned on Wednesday to the Political Cost of Marph that could be considered responsible for possible violence acts.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended on 31 October with 38 per cent of votes before 32 per cent of Alassane Ouattara, which was publicly supported by former President Henri Konan Bédié (25 per cent in the first trip).
The unemployment rate remains stabil in France in the third quarter
The International Work Organization (OIT), the rate of unemployment in France has been established at 9.3 per cent in the continental territory (9.7 per cent, taking into account the ultra-sea departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional stational variations (CVE) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of stops remains at 2.63000 in the continental France.
The data of the second trimester have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population in continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase of 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third trimester, but they wanted to work, are or are not available in the two weeks to work and seek or not job.
The situation of young people present on the working market has continued to increase the rate of unemployment up to 24.2% in the continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), including DOMs.
The third trimester, 637.000 youths from 15 to 24 years were stopped in the sense of the OIT.
In its part, an easily increase in the couple has been registered between advanced age people, up to 6.4% in Continent France (+0.2 points both in three months and one year), meaning, 482.000 people over 50 years, a number increased to 6.6% with DOMs.
There was only a stability of age between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in the continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all France.
Insee has led since 2006 without publishing the rate of the par men, after a polemic on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the Statistical Agency of the European Union, continues to do it and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, a 53-year-old director of residual treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is investigated and has been in prison in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of a research on public contracts supposedly fraudulently.
Alexandre Guérini is investigated by abus of social goods, misuse of funds and public goods, coverage, active corruption, traffic of influences and munitional positions, it is indicated to its advocate.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and reply to all the questions the magistrate asks, not to imagine."
"It is easy to make it easy for a multitude of reprehensive acts, another thing is demonstrating them," AFP had declared its lawyer, Florence Rault, before its client's comparison.
Mr Guérini, a brother of the PS leader in the Department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to send to the judge a document to explain.
On midnight, they began to investigate and arrested one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
It is your lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing that your customer has done is to be occupied of the verteders that should be managed.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to its implementation, he does not know anything about it, the letter Simon says.
In the framework of this issue, it is also investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, the ex-General Director of the Services of the Civil Aglomeration of Aubagne, because of the misconversion of funds and complication, but they have left him in conditional freedom and has seen with the protagonists of the case.
"My client was able to explain all the facts that have been reproached to you."
"The magistrate instructor has taken into account the explanations and has left it free," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Wednesday evening, four others were asked and left freedom, under judicial control in the case of two of them, was indicated by the added tax of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, added director of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "traffic of influenza and passive corruption".
Two officials of Aubagne's agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringier, have been asked by "sustration and malversation of public goods by a person dedicated to the public service" and "complication in public funds evil." respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, is investigated by "coverage of the abuse of social goods".
Among those who have been held to Mr Guérini figure Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently in prison in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Croatia.
Researchers suspect that their companies have a service to blanque the capital of the great bandidism.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions launched against X in April 2009 after receiving anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A close source of research indicates that investigations are particularly focused on the conditions of assignment and functioning of a vertebrary in La Ciotat, which collects Aubagne's waste, as well as other cities of the city community of Marsella (MPM).
Subject of Clotilde Ress: Eliseo has exagered Syria's mediation
More than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the destination of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigation arrested in Iran by "spionage", has been in the public in France, has warned the diplomacy and has encouraged the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
All under the attention of the United States diplomatics.
The documents and documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained his strategy to the andes to give them advice to manage their own "rehenes" crisis in Iran (a small group of senders).
They show how the French responsibles convinced Washington that the freedom of the French young man was not made in exchange for the release of ­*id Kakavand, a Iranian detained in France and searched for justice and ­ material trafficking for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the cruel reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, had performed a essential role in the release of Clotilde Kings.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram edited on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage the cases of rehenes."
Eliseo's adviser for strategic matters, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaking with the diplomatic and Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the following to repatriate their own citizens holding force in Iran.
"Haced sound," they say, "continue" in the media, the words "based human rights", "inocence", "subsequent freedom".
Everything to confuse the Iranian regime, careful of your image.
"When Iranians ask you to stop, do it more frequently."
Because, once the negotiation attempts for discrete channels, "the silence will not solve anything," Iranians are "experts in dilatory hands".
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a habitual iranic tactic: the taking of rehenes for political songs".
It announces that Clotilde Reiss' freedom of prison (which will be produced on 16 August, the day in which it will be re-emballed in France) will "require to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of rehab).
Moreover, it states that Elisha is anticipating other rehenes crisis, a phenomenon that "will grow".
The Iranians could "in a future to stop one of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," .
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Kings comes out of prison after twelve days, but it is locked in Iran.
The following information is distributed: the Iraniid Kakavand, whose additional requests the United States for illegal traffic of electronic material delicted to Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The ambassador and, as many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is near the Iranian clandestine networks for the nuclear program, the catching of §id Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted a exchange?
Free Iranian instead of French?
A new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier guaranteed that it wasn't so.
Eliseo, not only "is excited greatly by the judge's decision," but has opposed it to the same.
"There were intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister for Justice" (in the time of Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "The French Government cannot cancel the decision," comments.
Mr. Richier also wants to prove that Kakavand continues under the "est" monitoring of French information services.
Eliseo's counselor marks a number of phones, cuelga and then informs the diplomatic and that the Iranian is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian ambassador.
The detention of Clotilde Ress in Iran, Eliseo does not fail in efforts, uses communications and "fuges" organized in the media to believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediterrane".
The andes observe this activity with certain ironicity and check that manipulation brings its fruits, since several pressing articles transmit the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the average "blitz" of the French officers".
What such "gratulations" must be to Mr Assad, the ambassador in Paris is questioned.
"Despite their declarations full of praise, the French officers recognize in private that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then addresses the reasons that Eliseus has brought to stand to this fact.
The great efforts to communicate "this aims to validate Sarkozy Opening Policy to Syria," he says.
A policy started in 2008, which "in view of many critical voices in France and foreigner, just was cut off of pre-mortal and dismerciated".
When "exhere the Syrian paper," Paris "to show Syria the elogies that can cover if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The goal also consists of "remember the seed of discouragement between Syria and Iran".
The ambassador and it knows of a good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusted him: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But in all ways, if we thank him."
"It should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy gets her in Eliseo.
In a communication, thanks to the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having made a "active paper for the freedom of our companion".
From midnight, young Korean can't play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "of Cenicity" that will impede adolescents to join online games after midnight by blocking their access, which has been indicated by government responsibility.
In December, a draft law will be submitted to the Parliament to request online games to block access to these games after midnight to younger ones less than 16 years of age, and the representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family have been indicated.
"Multiple children play all night, and then it results difficult to study at school and take a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect its health and the right to dream," AFP Jo Rin, ministerial responsible for the draft law.
Online games are available again at the sixth morning.
Companys will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, precisely.
The Government is also planning to request companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when youth parents so request it, the responsible added.
Furthermore, it will be available to anyone who requests free information programs that allow the Internet connection time to limit.
South Korea is one of the most "even" countries and the magazines regularly give news about various facts linked to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the inaccessible campaign of the worldwide competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, where other 58 countries were held.
World 2018-2022: the FIFA is designed to the organizational countries
In the middle of the torment caused by corruption suspects, the Executive Committee of the FIFA designates Thursdays to the World Cops Organizators countries of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political choice where the influence and lobbying fights can come to primary on technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 e of the FIFA competition will be celebrated in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands).
The egt of 2022 will be much more exotic, since the International Federation expects to win new territory (Qatar, Âa), after an extreme in the African continent in 2010, or to proÃ¡pÃ© with its implantation in the United States or in the League East (JapÃ¡, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the issue of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Beckyff) attacks the economic and political interests playing in a World.
The transactions between bastidors, therefore, are possible to take up until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
The FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese candidatures (2018) and (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of voting.
Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Themerie and Amos Adamu), could have destroyed the opportunities of his country, with football, which only accepted the World once in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the hour on Monday by distributing a documentary that has proved to three members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Suficient to disguss the FIFA and shame the English responsibles, which have been launched to an intense lobbying in the last weeks with David Cameron.
The Governing Boss expects to re-educate the fight given successfully by his precedent, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of JJ.O. 2012 in 2005 for London.
Is this intense activity enough to restore England before the EC?
It is not clear, since Spain-Portugal also accounts with many strong points thanks to its stages, ready, its experience (Mundial of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe Copa in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, economic and financial perspectives of both countries could be ambitional.
Possible represalies against English and doubts about the solution of Spain and Portugal are the only way to put points to Russia, converted into a weight outside despite the laguns in their candidature (state, hotels, transport).
However, the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and claimed a "delegal competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct statement to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"They're getting rid of their sucking traps, committing them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which have experience in 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
The first world economic power and the main patrocinators of the FIFA, the country seems to benefit Japan and South Korea, which have developed separately a excellent project.
However, these new candidatures seem to be preliminary for two countries who have organized the campaign together in 2002.
Other risks: the global concession 2026 to China, quite desired by the FIFA, which would cause Asia to remain without possibilities for 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project is based on future stages, and the FIFA would promote its expansion to new hours, but both countries have more risks than certain.
Like Japan and Korea, it could also be threatened by the deficiency of payed TV rights (in accordance with the timely difference) by the European countries, the FIFA war's dust.
Second mandate: test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had made a sense of doubt.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less yet.
A mandate in Eliseo brings one another.
Therefore, the current State head will be candidate again in 2012.
However, tests of this are not well combined with the mystery that seems to be associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always be shown that it is doubtful.
To one side and towards the other.
In 2006, though they did not believe that, Jacques Chirac's friends would not reject a third mandate.
On 15 November, in serious tongue, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would take his decision "in a moment in 2011."
Thus, the fact that it handles UMP members on Thursday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a certain revision.
Is this the official announcement of your candidature?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of mandates of five years.
I simply transmitted the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he talks about the presidents, with a game ton, in the meeting of this type.
"In the worst, or better, in cases, you will still pass seven years and a half with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, "You don't think I don't plan myself what will come after."
Its previous events are not closer to the candidature anymore, nor less.
They subscribe comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the career by the candidature in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Segolène Royal has come up to the palace that leads to Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
In contrast, the fact that its candidate is evident in 2012 is that leads to many PS people to claim that the battle is organized before the planned.
On the other hand, the bad sondeos.
For the first time, the electors prefer the candidature from François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy ( 46% against 44%, BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the issue in the UMP," he immediately repeated the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can do, you will not be candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"You'll always think you can win," Alain Juppé corrects, resigned before the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is binding to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be allowed to identify the outcome of the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should be completed at the end of the year.
Because of the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the emission institution of Frankfurt cannot be allowed to be so persistent if he does not want to risk to increase a situation more than complicated today on European obligations markets.
The political cost would be equal to high.
Last night, during a pressing road, the Minister for Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB for the solution to the crisis of the debt of the European States.
He did not mean if he considered that the central responsibility should do more, for example, increasing its programme for the purchase of State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my European companions.".
The viper, in Brussels, during its audience before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more famous about its intentions, only indicating that the programme of purchase of Letters of the State on the secondary market was "continued" and that "we will see what we have decided" during June.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main type incapable at 1%, the lowest level of his history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of the Treasury obligations by the ECB has been duplicated last week until approximately 1,350 million euros.
Furthermore, if the market operators were increased, Irish and Portuguese titles would have been bought again.
In total, the euro's central assets have bought titles for a amount of EUR 67,000 million since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchase will be followed (see page 29).
Economy's also do not prevent significant changes in rubbish.
Although over three months loan operations have been dismissed from the ECB's arsenal, it is still performing unlimited liquidity allocations to profitable conditions and durations that varie between one and three months.
Economys expect this device to be extended today for a few months.
"I don't imagine I'm gonna change your program."
"If not, it would be the risk of providing new short-term pressures," says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economy.
"The more seems to be a progressive outcome announced during the first trimester of 2011," he preached by his side by Norbert Brüms, the economicist in Sal.
Uppenheim.
As regards interventions on the public duty market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of those obligations to maintain the market stability," adds Norbert Brems.
Taking into account the importance of European exposures to the euro area's summer debts markets, the emission institution has no more option than maintaining its presence on the market.
"It must compensate any price the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that prevents an outstanding marking of the results of the most fragile States," a major commitment manager thought yesterday.
Because, if the types of interest are placed through the clouds, the States will still have more problems to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi leads to the time
After Italy has started the week in a worrying way, the situation has easily improved yesterday with the reflux of the types of obligations at 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
At the outcome of a › with the Ministry of Economics, the regional presidents have heard Giulio Tremonti to qualify the situation of "indigiable" and expected an end of the "impre" week, which later dismissed by the interested.
In any case, the difference with the Dutch long-term types had reached the record number of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of silver (CRQ) had been shot up to the 263 points, providing a certain review in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi recommended that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was over 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was manifested "profundly concerned" by "turbulences in the markets" and for a possible account from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economicist in the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and this delay of incomes associated with it, which causes the State to risk that it cannot face its needs of financing.
The last previsions of Brussels have assumed a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that the Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on a number of 1.3% and 2% respectively.
In these conditions, the European Commission will represent the public deficit of 4,3% of the PIB in the next year (on 3.9% of the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
The opinion that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the festivals, for a amount of EUR 7,000.
"If necessary, new outermost measures should be adopted," said the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, O日 Rehn.
For this time, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The bases of its economy are in order and their accounts in good state, as we have been saying from a while," Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator in the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the FMI.
"There is no immediate or short or long-term problem, since, despite its significant duty (119.2 per cent of the PIB in 2011, NDLR), the efforts requested for stabilising in Italy are less than those required for other countries," comments Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD leader economicist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be held to a censuring motion in the Deputy Chamber, after which elections could be preceded at the end of March.
In such cases, a small period would be opened to make decisions in case of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of mechanisms for combating crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press road in Paris: "I think we have already shown the Sunday, for night and day, that the Europeans are clearly solid, decided, committed with the defense of their currency and their monetary area."
Although it was related, the relaxation registered in the types of European States ' obligations has encouraged governments and the ECB.
However, we can not yet talk about a standardization principle.
The Standard & Poor's Classification Agency announced that Portugal's debt could be decreased, the most frequent white at the moment of speculations.
"Thus as in May, there is really no political clarity and transparency, which is significantly weakening on the systems," the Economy of Exane BNP Paris opinions.
Especially because "the political rytme is much slower than the market rythme".
Conscients of this heat and the dangers they hide, the European countries intensify the debates to strengthen existing crisis output mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance which are more directly affected and, in general, with G-20's homologs are in good way.
This also takes into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the market coliminator (see above).
As regards the European Financial Stability Fund (FEEF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has started on Thursday in Singapore a resort from Asia to inform the Investors of the League East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits is not to recover funds, there is no doubt preparation for the land.
FEEF's first titles are expected to be performed in the next month.
Yesterday, an official representative and has confidenced to the Agency Re·s that the United States would support a potential increase in mobilised funds through an additional direct commitment to the FMI.
As regards the countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain, these are prepared to adopt reforms, particularly in relation to the organization of the work market.
These reforms are added to the outermost measures with a closer effect.
Lisboa and Madrid want to progress in a different way to which Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid any coast to request international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and to decide the reforms that are considerable to increase confidence in a sustainable manner.
The capitalists of the European funds are finally set up the options available to accelerate the normalization process of public obligations markets.
By the time of Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first in launching the idea that if the 750,000 million euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not doubt to take the portfolio again.
Economys of Barclays Capital, a first-line actor on the European public debt market, consider that an amount of about 1000,000 million additional euros would be sufficient, "preferebly" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is an instrument for this: the European financial stability mechanism, currently financed with EUR 60,000 million.
An advice that would certainly be able to determine the European capitals.
In particular, the market conditions will be decreased.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in narrow warning
Snows continue to cause difficulties of employment, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in warning due to the risk of ice and ice training.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been summarized to the twenty departments that were already in a narrang warning, tenth from mid-day and two, Dordogne and Gironde, were joined to the group by night.
See Weather France, the strong snow falls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it is also lightly snow at the island of France.
Snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, pointly between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments and between 1 and 3 cm, or even 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of low Normandia, France and Lemosin.
Snows are sufficiently strong as to cause difficulties of employment and affect some economic activities, France warning.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departmental roads have been accessed to weight vehicles of more than 7,5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brie-Ludeac.
Gendarms are described, the employment in the secondary network of British is complicated, so they recommend that it be not conducted except in case of need and that certain TER vehicles have been held during the day.
Thursday, school transport in Picardia has been held.
No specific measures were intended on midnight to limit the heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to lead with greater ability on the roads and to adapt their conduct to the situation".
The Director-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested air companies to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights in the Roissy Paris and 10% in Orly due to the planned neves.
The DGAC recommends air passengers to contact its line.
In Britain, the Gatwick port, south of London, and Edimburg, in Ethiopia, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of the Grand Paris: first finance waste
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the French Island has reached its close point, there are thousands of millions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talk about 23,000 million for the metro of the Grand Paris to build the Society du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4.000 million.
At the theoretical level, this sum will later allow SGP to obtain loans on the markets to finance a part of its double bulk.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 rectification funds law, examined in the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the instruments intended to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the tax on offices in the France Island.
The first, if we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Society du Grand Paris".
Moreover, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is an amendment of a tax on offices already existing "to modernize it, increase its product and intend that increase to the Society du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no ciphers in the text.
But he's far from 4.000 million.
"Tax resources are needed to be added to EUR 4.000 million from the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and which will be granted to the Grand Paris Society as the project is in progress," we can read in the exhibition of reasons.
The SGP doesn't affect this system.
"From the time income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4.000 million later, we explain."
"The budget will be registered and shall be used in accordance with the needs."
The SGP calculates that it will begin receiving the 4.000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 000 million promised are not in the credit, can cause a clearly implemented parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Hackers winners and diligent spices
The WikiLeaks matter has a double value.
On the one hand, it shows a appearing scandal, a scandal that seems just scandal to the hypocresy that leads to relations between States, citizens and press.
On the other hand, he announced deep changes at international level and predicted a future dominated by the return.
But we're going to pass.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each issuer created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is formed by press rears.
The "extraordinary" revelations and events on the sexual habits of Berlusconi only reflect what has been written for months ago in any period (excluding those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's teachingly ridiculizing profile has long been given ideas to cabaret artists to create their schetches.
The standard is that secret issues must only be formed by public knowledge news is essential for the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to exoterical publications, you will see that each work repeat (of the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templaries or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This should not only be that the authors of hidden texts would not want to do inevitable research (or they don't know where to find news about the inexistence), but because those who dedicate themselves to ocultism are not only trusting in what they already know, which reaffirms what they have already done.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret issues.
The informator is periodic, as it is perisional (or has little anxiety) the head of secret services (if it could not be, I know what, editor of the Libération), which only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that sent the emphasis and Romans to the State Department was the same that Newsweek published the previous week.
So why have you caused such revision of the revelations of these expedients?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, namely, that the ambassadors, at least since the Second World War and since the Governors of States can be called by phone or take the plane to meet, have lost their diplomatic role and have been transformed into spying centers.
What spectacular looking for research films knows it perfectly, we just appear that we don't know it for hypocresy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly infringes the responsibility of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of diplomacy and §.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most powerful secrets of the world's most powerful country's secrets to consider the prestigiation of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both victims and "green".
But we're going into the real nature of what happened.
Earlier, at Orwell's time, it could be designed for all powers as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has been real since, by controlling every movement by phone, every transaction performed, visited, taken autopise, the citizen became so a complete victim of power.
But when it is shown, as it now happens, that even if the encryptions of power secrets cannot escape to the control of a hacker, the control relationship stops to be unique and returns.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the winner of the citizens) can know all the secrets of the power.
How can you endure a power that can't save your own secrets anymore?
It is true, as already said Georg Simmel, that a true secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret can never be discovered); it is also true that all knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a empty, unsecret secret, because it comes from the public area; but discovering, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all power.
WikiLeaks didn't hurt anyone to Sarkozy or Merkel, but, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this hurt caused to so powerful power?
It is evident that in the future, the States will no longer put any booked information on the network, since it would be like to publish it in a full road cartridge.
But it is also evident that, with current technologies, it is not possible to keep confidential conversations by phone.
Nothing is easier to discover if and when a State Chairman has moved to a plane and has been contacted with one of the homologs.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly that, for the present time, my prevision is a thing of science fiction, and therefore, newly, but I imagine government agents who are discreetly moved in diligences with incontrolable it, bringing messages that have been made of memory or, as much, hiding some data written in the tacons of their legs.
This information is then stored in one single copy in closed boxes: for the purpose of the account, the Watergate spending attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I wrote that the technology currently goes out as a cangred, mean, back.
A centurie after the telegraph without cables has revolutionated communications, the Internet has turned to create a cables telegraph (telephones).
Videos (analogicals) had allowed cinema researchers to study a passport movie, progressing and backwarding, discovering all mounting secrets, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to progress or back in chapters, which is, to large proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Millan in three hours, while in the aircraft, with the movements he had, we need three hours and a half.
Therefore, it is nothing out of normality that policy and communication techniques bring us back to horses cars.
A last comment.
In the past, the press was to understand what was in secret in the ambassadors.
Currently, the campaigns request confidential information to the press.
Climate: France's heads in their financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the financing promises have been quickly dislocked (fast start or pre-release) carried out by developed countries.
And the French shoes have been discovered.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed 30,000 million dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed 7.200 million euros in three years and France 60 million euros (e.g. 420 million per year).
The opening of the COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment with fast start finance is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press road, a great additional event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was resulting and was actually valuable: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 2.200 million euros, which is the situation in the good way to comply with its commitment of 7.200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation delicately, things are more complicated.
The Copenhagen Agreement must be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is made without prejudice to the official development aid.
Unfortunately, there has not been an agreement on what it means "new and additional".
When the European Commission proposed a harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have locked the procedure.
Currently, everyone chooses the reference which he more agrees.
For example, the European Commission has been referring to 2009: international funding is maintained and added to 150 million in three years as a fast start finance concept.
Other countries have chosen similar references to the year or level of official development aid.
In contrast, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, the expenditure of the previous years or the total level of official development aid is not referring.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even reduce) while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional funds"...
Another crucial element, the share between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and each chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, believe that each euro provided is equal to a given euro.
Clearly, this is difficult to justificate: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are rentable (frequently, projects relating to the reduction of more effective technologies), it is fair to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is granted... as much, only should be computed for its commitments the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (e.g. the equivalent to a type of interest).
However, France does not find useful reasoning: "respect" its commitment of 420 million euros by 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it by its own eyes.
It is the only country of the Union that so often uses the loan.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Danish, Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union offers a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only offers ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good truck!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France makes a double misuse: one part, in relation to actions at the time and, on the other hand, in relation to the real financial effort.
Only 36.1 million euros cost, it can be able to give the impression that it costs 420 million "new and additional" as it promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems to be Bercy who has been occupied of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give when they can simply provide it?) and in negotiations, since the developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter of the precautionary financing is a minucy, short-term, in relation to the total of climate negotiations.
But it could be a rain grain of more in the great but would be the CMNUCC.
Let's hope that it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential for this first year of preliminary funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, in order to respect its commitments and in the same way as the rest of the European Union.
However, in particular France could make progress in the debates on playing stages in terms of long-term financing (other essential chapter currently discussed): we will not be freed from the issue of the "additional caracter" or of the method of computing the loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
So we have the hope of the new Environment Ministry, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, that will come to Cancún the next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast beginning of France and its vision of the "additional caracter" and the use of loans would contribute to improve the international confidence level necessary to progress in negotiations.
Warning on children's pesticides
A 10-year-old child incomes on a day of 81 different chemical substances, is indicated a study published on Wednesday by the Geneerings Futures Association (the former movement for the rights and the respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analysed, but they are illustrative of the treated problem," wined in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods that would like to consume a child of about ten years in four foods and a tender day.
These foods taken as a model, respecting the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of milk products and 1,5 litres of water per day), as well as golosin, were examined in the search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is abusive: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as possible cancers or Others and five classified as safe cancer cancer, as well as 37 substances that may be acted as endocrin pollutants (PE), are studies of various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although the total of the cases is not exceeding the legal limits for each individual chemical substance, our study clearly shows that the exhibition of consumers to contaminants may be cancer and/or concernful," states the association.
For the dilution, the cow and the tea with milk contain for themselves more than one decade of possible cancer residues and three considered as safe cancer, as well as near a twenty-five residues that can threaten to the hormonal system.
The brass, imported from Brazil, as scheduled for college, contains six chemical substances, including a funicide in France.
The same applies to the Green Jews of Kenia, including food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide in the EU.
Furthermore, the Russian film, the tune on the lat, and even the bread bar or the cycle were added to pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of the griff, the analysis discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
At the dinner, the salmon round was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to calm food in the microwaves was not completely rough.
The final risk that generates these "confusion cocktails" for the consumer "probe is underestimated", says the study.
The European Ecology-Les Verts Alianza (EE-LV), on its part, has proposed "for the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratory on the use of pesticides to breathe "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (AESA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
