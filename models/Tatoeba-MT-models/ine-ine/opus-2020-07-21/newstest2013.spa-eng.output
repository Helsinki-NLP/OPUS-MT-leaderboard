A republican strategy to prevent Obama's reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy for the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this last a myth and that electoral fraude is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die due to the fall of a radius.
In fact, the Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is true: these new provisions will affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will be mixed in part by the American democratic system.
In contrast with what is happening in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, most of the American governments have promoted new laws that were difficult for the inscription or voting process since 2009.
This phenomenon was extended after the elections of November 2010, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011, 180 law projects were introduced to restrict the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require that electors present an identity document with a graphics, as well as a test of American citizenship.
On the other hand, those laws reduce the previous voting periods, invalidate the right to register themselves as electors on the day of the scrutiny and return their right to vote to the citizens with criminal advances.
Before the elections of 2006, no American state required the electors to present an identity document with graphographic.
The Indian State was the first in ́t.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
That is why the Republican authorities were depressed to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported law projects in 34 states to force electors to present a graphographic identity document.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, the American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the map of social security.
In fact, 11 per cent of the American citizens, namely, 21 million people in age of voting, are not accounted of any identity document issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new electors in 2012 lack of an identity document with these characteristics.
But often, the obtaining of the required identity document costs more than hundred dollars.
Thus, new restrictions affect young people, minorities and low income.
In fact, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people who win less than 35,000 dollars per year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years, and 20 per cent of electors between 18 and 29 years are not accounted for an identity document.
And there's still more.
In many states, students who vote most to democratic candidates cannot use the identity document with graphographic issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states authorize the members of the fishing clubs or of cattle that vote to the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the proof of citizenship to vote.
Arõna was the first state in presenting that requirement.
Since 2011, a twelve states have adopted laws that require the electors to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly seeking to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two of each three Spanish electors support the democratic party.
On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported certain laws that distorted the registration of electors on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
Furthermore, the right of persons and groups to create a support service to electors who wanted to be entered.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, the electoral registration campaigns contributed to the record of approximately 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have concluded that the recording rate of new electors was falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that promoted the reduction of the voting period in progress.
For example, in the elections of 2008 in Florida, 33 per cent of the electors who voted forward were African, while these recently represented only 13 per cent of the state electors.
In the case of the Spanish, exactly the same happened.
These represent only 11% of the electors, which is 24% of the citizens who vote forward.
However, whites, representing a 76% of the electorate, represent more than 46% of the citizens voting forward.
Of course, democrate legislators and their parties have distorted the adoption of laws restricting the register of electors.
In this regard, the Democratic Governors have locked several legislative projects.
The Office Minister of the United States Intervention to suspend the most contrary laws.
In part, it was possible to limit damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law required for the presentation of an identity document with graphographic.
However, it is unnecessary that the new adopted rules will complicate the exercise of voting right in 2012.
Democratic critics denied the partial character of the laws voted, since it is clear that it is intended to affect the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report from the Brandan Centre of 2011 shows that the states adopted by those laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too quick to ensure that these legislative amendments at electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections of 2012.
One thing is true: these new provisions will affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, the measures will partly minish the American democratic system.
Prostat cancer detection: Does the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test presents sometimes wrong results with negative results or even positive results, after which it is decided to carry out unusual medical interventions.
It's a more than enough reason to make men doubting, already rejecting themselves, about whether the detection tests should be made or not.
Do you do the test or not?
We have requested two experts' advice.
In the studies carried out in the United States, a large range of counterfeit between the sample groups was found, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to make firm recommendations.
In its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who were not.
The study, with a follow-up of 12 years, also showed that there was between 30 and 40 per cent of the possibilities to suffer metastatis if the detection test was not performed.
So I recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if your father has suffered prostat cancer.
African men of origin have a higher risk.
The key is to make a good decision when the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to achieve that the patient understands the risk level of its cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily treat prostat cancers that do not care for long-term life, in the case of which it should be chosen better for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated because that cancer is not aggressive or risks for their lives.
Instead, we propose to you an active monitoring of the disease and, if this progresses, we offer them a treatment.
We determine more frequently necessary criteria to decide who should be treated or not.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be made or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool that allows to evaluate PSA test pros and contrasts.
This document can be performed (for the moment only in English, but there will be translations within a short time) in the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-↓
Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful receipt to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering of disease.
We believe that if everyone eats well and moves enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If no one smoke, that rate would be raised at least 50%," Andre Beaulieu, leader of the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we evaluate that about 10% of cancers are heritage.
Many others are still totally unexplainable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against Tabakism remains a priority despite the reduction of the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of the cases of pulmonary cancer.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It is extremely harmful for people's health.
"Today, there are still 1,5 million smokers in Quebec," said the portfolio André Beaulieu.
A hoped date: 10 years after the stop of smoking, the risk of cancer death is reduced to half.
The weight
Grass and obesity also promotes the appearance of the disease, is the SCC.
Increases the risks of mama, colon and right cancer, sofago, pancreas and use.
"The research shows that the regular physical activity practice during the whole life protects against mother cancer," adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering a color-related cancer.
Carcutary products should also be avoided.
Keeping meat for its aroma, sugar or salmon can cause the formation of cancer substances.
"You can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamines
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamins and cancer completes.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictorial.
While in one of them a decrease of the risks of prostat cancer was found, in another, it was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer was also not able to be clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about concerns and family prejudices of each one with your doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
The detailed Higgs box
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boss generated a great conmotion last year, and reasonably.
In fact, this boss is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that is in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
Moreover, it is the part of which the standard model predicted: our best or "minder bad" explaining of the nature and the behavior of the material, which has not yet been observed empirely.
But for physicians, it's not clear that it's about Higgs.
We certainly know that there is a new part and that it looks very like the Higgs boss predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data discovered this week at an important physical convention held in Kioto seems to be confirmed that it is, although there are still more data to be completely secure.
We'll assume that it's about Higgs, because the possibilities of mistakes seem little.
There is, in this large world, a generalized and unfair law that involves that two things cannot be found at the same time.
There is no way to infringe that standard and not too understand it, because it'll be done by hurt.
Although the physics of the particulates are a very complete world, there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which suggests that two particulates cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "kvantic state"; a "status" which contains, greatly, of some of its characteristics.
Physics classifies parts in two categories.
On one hand, we met the good citizens called Fermiones, who are wisely obedient to Pauli's beginning.
And on the other hand, they are the boys, a suck of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found at the same place and at the same time.
It is the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories that, in fact, is extraordinary, youths are divided into two groups: the months, of which we will not talk here, and the "power parts", for which the great forces of the nature are spread and with which the Higgs bosson would be somehow empered.
These youths, I'd be able to subray here, are not the exotic biches we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it is thanks to a extraordinary banal boss: the foton or the "light part" that acts as "message" of the electrical force.
In fact, when a part with a load of the rubber accelerates or changes the direction, "deorder" the electromagnetical field in that precise environment; a little like when we lay a stone to a stone.
In this "desord" is born a electromagnetic wall (from the light, the infrareds, the ultraviolets, etc.), and this wall is nothing but a foton; it is, one of the "force porters".
More Stable Field
It happens the same with Higgs' boss, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs field, which must be "desorted" to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it needs to reach extremely high energy, a little as if it was a yellow stone in which soon a gross rock could be shipped through the surface.
That is why there is a huge accelerator of particulates like the CERN (the big hadrone collisionator is a 27km ring of circumference!) to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electric field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all parts or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like imanes, do it, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept at the door of a neck.
And in the same way, not all parts interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (as the foton, certainly), they do not have it.
What, however, can all of these investigations be brought?, Mrs. Plamondon asks.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicians to strike the differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
For its part, many wish to find themselves, because the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physical" that taught some of the model.
This, it must be said, has yet great feelings, such as it does not propose any explanation about seriousness (ups!) or dark material, which corresponds to about 80% of the universe's material (other ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these investigations today are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be no one.
To see: At the beginning of the 60s, laser layers in the Easters were not absolutely doubting the revolution that their work would cause.
They were interviewing citizen applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physician Willard Boyle said, who worked in the Bells, where the lazer was invented in 1960, and that designed the first continuous laser (the first was pulsed) in 1962, at the beginning the laser was more well considered as a "equity apparatus".
Imagine...
Moreover, applications can also result from all the instruments around the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle designed a light captator in 1969 through its optical research.
Although it was not absolutely its original intention, this captator now serves "oe" for all the digital devices in the world, which was worth the Nobel of Physics in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that LHC's activities would need to transform our lives, but that they never know...
Paliative care. The best way to die...
In his committee Death in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be repeated soon as a draft law is prepared.
However, within that essential dominion, there is still a lot to do.
Devoir has seen him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived only in his apartment of Montérégie.
The prostat cancer that was destroying him had given him a breath of two years.
"I had given me five years of life, but I had already taken so seven," she reported, made a pass, thrown in her bed in the center of Palatitive care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which he came the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," she continues.
Sickness has caused you to be troubled: a great weakness that prevents you to go alone to the bathroom and even eat for yourself alone.
Sented before a pleasant holiday, accepted resigned to help you eat.
Valent, he even comes to smile, talk to the unknown who cares for him, bring him medicines and offer him a bathroom.
The courage of death.
"My biggest desire is that they cure me the diarree, it's humble," she confess.
A few hours later, the team found that bad medicine.
"In the course of our lives we're going to make a man stone," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the Victor-Gadbois center.
Rejoice in your childhood, for certain people, is an inacceptable humility.
"This depends on the ability of the person to accept that return," he states.
Because, the view of most people who work in palatiative care is the great moments are in the heart of that return.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois Palative Preservation Centre suffer cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and doctors that are around no longer offer "curative care".
The biggest fear of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is to die "conscious and ashamed."
But the disease has made her children discover.
"I have good kids," adds.
"I don't have any more desires in this life," he says, before accepting that you put a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next days, a last visit of your son living in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and food assistance.
They are paliative cares that are given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help your death be more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have a paliative care bed for each 11.700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know we're all gonna end die some day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the centre.
Be at a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The deadly is offered injuries with brandy or Pepsi, if you ask.
The diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
The death is part of the daily.
We served a beer to Mr. X yesterday, who died during the night.
Tomorrow, his son ended the beer at the feet of the dead.
"We help both patients and their dear ones," reports Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center, the days past without being ever equal.
On the side of a 94-year-old man who sabowed his last family in the past, well placed between his holidays while everyone drinks for his health, a 36-year-old young man dies in tragic manner, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having done everything to survive.
"Seven months ago, there are always three to five beds occupied by people less than 45 years of cancer," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of patients who are admitted in the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from their home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palatiative care
A 77% of the Canadians simply do not have access to paliative care, namely to the cares designed to allocate the suffering when a person reaches the terminal phase of his life, either in his home, in the hospital or in a centre of care.
And several organisms, such as the Victor-Gadbois centre and the paliative care society at the Grand Montréal home, are almost specialized in the care of patients with cancer.
It is precisely that relative care in Quebec's health care that makes many specialised doctors fear the adoption of a law that regulates Eutanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a demonstration signed by eminences of paliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, was to demonstrate its opposite to such initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel, the healthy system of Quebec is not sufficiently competent to ensure that anybody has the right to the quality care before it is accepted to conduct with Eutanasia.
"Recently," she reports, "I saw a patient spent 14 days in Urgency suffering big pain without that it had been done as necessary to refrain from it.
I fear patients want to die only because they don't receive the appropriate care."
And parallelly, many oncologists are obtained with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predicts.
Helène Richard's surface hopes were already under minimum when he left an agotic chemotherapy.
"When I told my onchologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me she gave her a lot of pain that I wanted to stop fighting," she reported.
"Now, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!"
There are no all-powerful cares
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the demanding to die thanks to their careers that they have not made them in their requests once their pain has been aliviated thanks to a paliative care team.
But it must be said that palatiative care is not absolutely powerful in respect of the treatment of pain.
See Elsie Monereau, director of the paliative care at Grand Montréal home, patients do not respond to the treatment of pain in 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, doctors are going to recover to the paliative seat, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of their destruction, as well as as in a permanent manner.
We cannot conclude that we don't understand that part of suffering.
Each time, the non-aliviated disease will have the possibility of having that paliative seat.
The responsibilitys that are not aliviated all say the same: "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean necessarily "I'm Eutanasia", but "I'm quiet."
The implementation of this report has been possible by a beach of periodism of Canadian health research institutions.
Grand widespread immobiliar scandals in Quebec
Travel network functioners, BTP businesses, political party funds and specialists of the Italian mafia account, day after day, of what they know of an amazing "≤a", which is part of the construction industry, officers, politicians, sindicals and mafiatics.
A "industrie" which was too heavy to the Chebequense contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's interesting how the system pulses once we've caught the big media," Ironize Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and ancient Chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the scandal spread in 2011, which was possible for a basic research on the crimes related to road contracts in Quebec, that the Prime Minister of Liberal Library at that time, Jean Charest, had not been able to stop.
The "Duchesneau information" established a direct link between the industry, the clandestine financing of the parties and the corruption of officers.
"From the beginning of the research in 2010, only the transport ministry would have increased billion dollars in contracts," containing some of their instincts to stay with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission " has already fallen to two alms", adds, while expecting to be able to "demonstrate existing strategy behind individuals".
A permanent anticorruption unit created in 2011
The Permanent Anticorruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of interventors, researchers and analyses of the Government.
This unit also works for the police of the "Marteau Scooter", which since 2009 have made the "Cartel of Montreal Alcantarillado" moderate at the time of infringement of contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registered in series of accusations for fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, neighbouring a city outside.
The next of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just went away from his position of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspicioned that it has been repeatedly embarrassed in the exchange of public contracts.
It has formally been accused of engineers from Montreal's travel network and Italian companies, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
This last has caused conmotion by explaining to the committee the mechanism of the "A" receipt of public contracts.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a middleman connected to the mafia that transfered the money to the Montréal Union, the party of Mr. Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito shared money in the 2000s and organized over $88,000 Canadians (only $68,000) to provincies, especially the liberals in the power.
He also admitted a collection of illegal funds for the former Liberal Ministry, Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of the contracts of accantarillade
In Montreal, the corruption "a" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an extent of public works, explained it perfectly before the committee: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants, hokey party partys and a total of $6.000, all of them in exchange of contracts of alcantarillad whose costs were affected.
Other travel facilities have admitted that they have received money for infringement of the factures between 30% and 40% in conception of extra facilities.
Furthermore, a member of the party of the college, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he had made the fat view to a parallel budget and filled his arms of sucking money.
By the root of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay released at the beginning of November and led to Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first election policies in Montreal who made the alarm sound.
As a member of the Rivière-des-Prairies ́s ́s east of the island, the sale of a municipal land purchased by $5 million and returned by $1.6 million to the promotors in full immobiliary boom.
70% of the electoral campaigns' money was sucio
From the research that finally will be carried out, she assures that it brings "of a hilo to understand the function of the system, infiltred by hormigues, to stop the gangrena and fish the guilty."
And adds that the process is "worry, but positive".
We are doing the wounds but there would be a need for a research unit in Montreal and be very warned that doubtful practices should not be repeated.
How to do the easy.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, of its part, states that "the officers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is especially concerned about the role of the "elected policies on the stratageme course".
Assessing 70% of the proportion of suicide money that was destined to financ electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironised: "They said to me that it was not more than a painful reflection of the reality."
The Quebeques Government proposes to limit 100 dollars the donations to party, but that will not change the donation, if it, "and the electoral expenditures are not extremely limited, there will be suit money in the policy."
It provides a complete review of the system of public contracting and financing of parties: "We can't fall low; go to the foundation of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story emphasizes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look at the speech.
"The PSG isn't the FC Barcelona!"
This session has bought a new PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by a individual conscious tome, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day-by-day advance at your side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
And these elements move me daily to highlight the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything's going very quick in the football.
But I'm not stuck.
Since I started in the INF Preformation Centre to my step through Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed to aggressive steps.
It will benefit from the competition recovered by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recluses of this summer are used to dispute very high-level games.
They know each training is crucial.
That makes a player like I want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti offers me much about my position.
It is supported by attachments like Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technicals.
Today, there is no one equal in Liga 1 and is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think other titles will be brought to Paris.
In January, I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of lesions.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG at the first part of the season?
In Liga 1, Lyon has removed our leader position.
But we're on the ambassador.
One of our largest objectives is the campaign Liga: we have classified for the octaves of the final style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get the farest possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have much to say before many and very good European teams.
We want to begin to end the first of our link in front of the Oport to get the octaves of the end.
Can the PSG become a large European club to a short term?
He has the budget already...
To become a large European club, Paris must win titles and be long-term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to its means to make this project concrete.
Don't win the coffee in Liga 1, as in the last season, would you make a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great deception.
This year we will invest all our efforts in bringing us this campaign title.
We're not coming far at the last season.
In May, we had a deception, because we had the optimal conditions to end first.
We had a strong season.
We ended with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been campaigns...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a very better season.
This year I think it'll be the good.
Even if big teams such as Marsella, Lyon and Burdeos fight for the title, I think we're counting with the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media are waiting for more than PSG?
It's normal that they expect a lot of us if we think of what has been invested in the players we have.
We've completely accepted it.
After we won 4-0 in the house to Troyes, which still finds with things that are reproaching is a little frustrating.
We ask ourselves what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to run a game project.
A team is built with time.
We have shown that we can answer and be present in the campaign Liga.
Look at Manchester City that after two sessions, it hasn't been able to classify for eight-year-old eight, and they have also invested very much!
In view of the invested amounts, we would imagine you with 15 advantage points to the day.
That would be disobeying our opposers and the French campaign.
Lyon and Marsella, who were not well in the previous season, have been seen "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that Liga 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all difficulties, we have completed the trofeo.
The PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's success.
Better than we say we have a "Zlatandependence".
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and that is many goles.
He's coming to prove that it's the star of Liga 1.
And he has shown in all the teams that has happened to be a big player, a world star.
In the group we respect man and player.
And he also respects men who are around him.
What he did is really epcional.
This emphasizes others to increase their game level.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders of the world, also allows us to progress.
How did you live Eurocopa 2012 with the team of France?
It was a deception.
I was very entusiasmed to participate in this Eurocope.
Unfortunately, my lease prevented me to cumulate game time.
I saw things and I went out strengthened.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We learn the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and this must be an exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have from the first month of Didier Deschamps before the "blaus"?
You're getting results.
They are welcomed in the World Classification Group.
The selector is rigorous, near the players and inspires to win.
As was the case of Laurent Bla日.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Bla · has achieved its goal to classify us for the Eurocope.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the selection to Brazil.
The empathe (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to sit the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fighted for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't lived a similar game in all my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without sale
In contrast to current currency exchanges based on central holdings, identified transactions and processing charges between parties.
Moreover, as often occurs in technologies, political vision is insufficient: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of monopolies, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonimo), is at the same time a convertible monetary to dollars, euros, etc. and a safe change protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows exchange of files equally.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15.000 network computers.
And some thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The quotation of the bitcoin, after reaching $30 (23) in June 2011, fell to $2.5 months later, before returning to the 10 dollars today (countries are censed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it to world changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on the monetary currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the more successful monetary", "which computes with the dollar or the euro" and "like the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other systems with types of monetary types such as "credits" used to progress in a video game and that can be won by playing or buying (and even changing).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in all exchanges, a central authority controls and treats changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are rather than accountability books, checkers, currency and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, guaranteeing the anonymate.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed to a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the transaction's ability.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins contain in the public account book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key hito consists of writing that new transaction in that book.
This takes place by the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and winners, a species of provisional central bank, will have the privilege of adding that additional line.
It is a stage of file sharing, namely, of the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numeric box.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "smoking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular hole ( more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is good.
The transaction is then unstructively linked to the set of set of other transactions; any change would change the floor.
If, to make a fraud, a user would like to pay two times with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would remain orphan, because both have different shoes.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this resistance is regularly divided into two, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in ≥ 21 million is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are dead to the centmillion, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also shown in each increase in the calculation power.
The network's life has its highlights.
The websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stolen in deposit bitcoins.
"The failure used doesn't affect the same protocol," assured Pierre Noizat, which just started Paymium, a real currency paying company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money whiteness thanks to this anonymous service.
But the money in reality presents the same defect.
Weight operators such as Wikipedia pay the payments of this type.
Others, such as Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Sha and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the accountability book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins was not.
In November, the "Gigant Rebs" were launched.
"30,000 dollars have changed," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, turns the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, equals a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus exit closer.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain in the anonimate.
The system is easy to run in trades, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
They are enough to provide a address that a phone can "fotograph and recognize", needs Pierre Noizat, which ensures having thousands of users.
There is a general revision movement of hierarchy systems by more horizontal systems.
"There will have a time to put Bitcoin in, but in 2013 there could be a change," she predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB intends to revalue the different, high risks today, if this currency has success.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French groups abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The OTAN and the Americans must go out to the end of 2014.
It's time that the Afghanistan Army repeat its territory and the Afghanistans choose their future without waiting for anything of us.
We have punished the Afghanistan campaigns, which we have considered terrorists.
And to us, with our 88 murdered soldiers, more vulnerable and mutilated.
The Taliban accounts of foreign extremists and ancient heads repeated in Pakistan, but often also with campaigns that hold the presence of the foreign army, such as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaetic, even if the yihadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Uzbek, or Tayikos are joined.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurance, these will no longer be when western people are doing more discrete.
The partition of the French groups from Nijrab's base, which I observed from the top of the mountains planted by springs thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
The car and tank convoys returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, watched by the helicopters.
There will be no disappointment of Taliban in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country enveloped in fire and blood due to fighting between different factors.
Its control taken of the country was considered as a kind of freedom, the return to security.
The Afghanistans have paid the price of the darkness of their campaigns exceeded by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
Old manyhidines, the current government and the current Taliban are the desire to maintain women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the antisovetic war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making governmental lands to return them as solars to the resorts who have fled from Iran and Pakistan, benefited to a few large contracts and subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not been fighting.
People, if I have heard in the field, adhere to a government that is not formed by ladrones.
Many young people want to go away, as well as those who have learned to benefit from American generosity: capital escape is significant.
Young people are disappointed by war and their ideology.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have made their benefits.
With approximately 65% of its population less than 25 years old, Kabul has now counted with 5 million inhabitants, a fifth part of the total population.
In towns, state colleges are filled with both girls and children.
Young people who do not want to return to the darkness of ancient partys or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are aware of mobile phones. The television and its Turkish follets that present a modern world have great amazing people throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Should the authorities who want to direct the country be considered legally?
Ancient antisobiotic fighting commanders are already concerned about restructuring the provincies, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation to the image of the western nations. However, the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, removeing the position of the Prime Minister since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially because of the elections provided in April 2014.
However, its country depends on foreign aid since the 50s and even before.
No industry has re-establised its services, no emballage has been fixed or the important irrigation systems have been repared.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a devastated country after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The voice that Afghanistan had great mineral riches was expanded.
And that did not make more than to increase the feeling that the Westers were to be able to bear them.
Without energy to extract iron or cover minerals from the ground and without transport means to export them to the mountains, there is no mineral explosion.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak's cover mines, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to exhaust the great habitat location and remain there as the most important employees of the province.
It will also require that Afghanistan and Pakistan, the country of which imports and exports largely replace their normal relations.
The French groups shared on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides the continuation of traditional aid: girls, children colleagues, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the purpose of "gaining hearts and spirits" and to do the impossible task to make the help and offensive actions cover, a service of " civil and military actions" of the Defence Minister (Cimic), who was removed in 2012, brought to Â a small French NGO, a number of works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in tens of mountains.
These works, goloss to get the hand of local work, have been able to help contain insurrection: rice, powder, potable water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and growing cultivation surfaces.
What will I remember after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more moderate budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys often over 2,000 metres of high.
Embajada received decades of written applications with small agricultural proposals made by local communities from the province of Kapisa.
To be released from the insurrection carried out by the foreign groups, something that the agricultors said to me that they wanted would have to keep a small, well-controlled civil aid and that would be rightly reached.
A Constitution with forces in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than never regarding the constitutional declaration, which gives him provisionally full powers, he decided to play all over all.
He took all the world by surprise on midnight, when he announced that the Constitutional Assembly would vote its final text on the next day.
Just one week ago, the State head had given that Assembly two months more to finish his work.
And almost two years ago Egypt uses a provisional text, several times modified, which debilites institutional stability and leads to judicial wounds.
This new initiative has no longer done but to increase fraction in the country.
For its opposers, the President continues in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "training his word" and "peopleing the right".
By their partners, it is assured that it is a measure to finish the institutional and political crisis and to accelerate the transition process.
A reference should be organized in the next 15 days.
A very short-time lapse that forces the brothers to refuse their project to explain the text, article per article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimation while the political causes strike in the whole country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for their favor, as he interviewed the American Time weekend.
Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, it contains a last time for the Egyptian people: "or they vote on my text or I keep the full powers," powers that will probably reach its end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constitutive Assembly, islamic in its large majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals did not come to the convocation.
In the middle of November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they estimated that they could not make their views valuable.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary core, 11 persons, substituted, were approved at all once in the morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brothers.
As I was able to wait, the voted articles have been one-nimous.
The commentators, on the other hand, appreciate the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day had been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so many members of the committee believed that the constitutional hour was bad.
The text, which last night was still voted, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 object of all views, finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, which stated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of the right".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of the Islamic Law is a fundamental reivification, hoped that "the principles" could be set up by "the standards", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of its good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
Liberals take it from hypocresy and consider that it is not more than a public artim.
If they are, the islamization of the Constitution is made to other articles.
In particular, Article 220, which grants the University Al-Azhar a advisory role, especially for all who have to confirm their compliance with Sharia laws.
It is the specialist in Egypt in So日 Pommier, it is anxious because "the people called to speak are not chosen and have no democratic legitimateness.
Here we show the premises of a teocracy."
Moreover, the fears of Liberals are increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be less moderate than the current.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we are in the framework of the civil state.
The majority of the jurists who have worked in that text are not Ulemas but universitaries, some of them formed in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, preparing a tesis on the constitutional transition of Egypt.
But he recognises that there may be a certain ambition in return to article 220, because the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We are particularly referring to the term iqh [islamic jurisdiction, ndlr].
And the question that could be questioned in the future would be in which measure civil judges are competent to speak above all of this."
In addition to its religious nature, the voted text yesterday has received many criticisms relating to the extensive powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers will claim that they are few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.
Other conflicting point: the powers conferred to the military.
In accordance with the desire of military, the revision of the Defence Budget will not be subject to Parliament but to a national defence advice.
The processing of civilians in military courts will also be made, as requested by the associations for the defence of human rights.
These also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider freedom.
The blasphemia crime is maintained and, from now on, the insults are insults, which could cause serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially the whole of the press.
Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, subrays Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
If it is, the only positive has been the torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian President had to go out last night in television, manifestations were provided for this midnight.
The members of the head of the State appeared on the Sabbath.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect the holy land, the shadow of the world, and a sea of salmon
The Promised Earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a natural purity.
"AIF" identified the five important reasons for which Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Santa Earth
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters into this “baptismal pila” will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine in the wedding, walking on the waters, the calamity of the storm and the filled networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places is located in Jerusalem.
The believers return here the Viacrucis or the Path of Jesus ’ Property (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
Starts in the Fortaleza of Antonio, the Pretorium, where the judgment was fulfilled, and continues through the streets of the City of Viaja, goes to the Holy Sepulcro in the Mount Golgota, the place of the crossification, the Stone of the Unity and the place of Jesus ’ sepulture.
In this same place, there is also the true Christian Ombudsman of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Santiago in Jerusalem, built in the place where it was a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross was made for the crossing of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place for the Jews, the Mure of the Lamentations; the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the 70th DC.
As tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which then will be real.
Realize a vertical travel
The ruins of the Masada Fortaleza were the remaining of a secret king against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in 25 C.E. for his family.
They are located in the mountains at a height of 450 m over the sea level.
And come to it by their own means, only those who devote themselves to the scale can.
Others can reach this historical summary in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at a height of 1600-2040 m, there is the highest station of Hermon, where in winter months there is a great disturbance of tourists.
Even there, from the foot of the mountain, bus services are offered.
The total length of scale tracks is 45 km.
There is an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain, they probably lived by the Gentiles.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all on one travel.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
It is among them the Museum of Israel, near Knesset (Israean Parlament).
The ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rollos of Qumran are maintained in the cows of the wilderness of Judea, and about 500 thousand archeological and antropological parts.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel A.
In your exhibition of paintings, such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha Museo, which are some of the former Turkish bathroom rooms with model figures of visitors and banists of that time.
In Cesarea the pen is worth pass through the private Museum Ra, where the cultures of Rodin and Dalí can be amazed.
There are no tourist guides or tents of suvenirs there.
The entry is free, and categoryally donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocausto Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel A日, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Memorial of children, built in memory of 1,5 million children killed in concentration fields and gas cameras.
Inside him and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their life.
Ucrania is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located at the borders of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are pools, water parks, delfinary and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea, even in winter months, the water temperature does not below 21 degrees and the air is warming up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is still warmer and there are bathrooms for the whole year.
True, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point of the planet: 417 m below the sea level.
The waters from there are a salmour that easily supports those who do not know to nail.
The landscapes of the surroundings are really beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salted water, salmon and curative bars and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asma, echema, artritis, bronquitis, diabetes and to order their nerves.
Playing anti-equipment mysteries
Conserve them the former part of Tel A, the city of Jaffa, in the Mediterranean.
By her, the seaway was along with Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the former Greek and Egyptian laws.
It was recorded the legend, where Noah built his ark and Perseo rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he brought a long and happy life.
Tourists like to pass through the east streets that bring the names of the Zodiaco signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "miss" symbol, the happiness will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa, couples of recently married who come from all parts of Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Cesarea, the city of King Herod, it can pass through the Roman theater, "tomar" the strength of the crossed.
At the Roman times, Cesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Poncio Pilato.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera spectacles.
Turists Remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to wish: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this travel is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to sequels (for now 1-3,8 sequels).
The urban transport is mainly composed of buses, but there is a quick travel in Jerusalem, and in Haifa there is the only metro line of the country, which consists of six stations and ✔ the City low with the High City.
In fact, it's of a subterraneous funeral.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and by this price can be traveled through a transborder for 1,5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is, the Sabbath is celebrated.
Since Thursday evening to Sunday sunset, markets and tents are closed and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning starts a new working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only uses cosher food, which excludes green meat, marine, fished without squares and plates where milk and meat are combined.
There is offered a broad selection of plates based on bow and lamb meat, soaps and postres prepared with coco milk, the traditional Hebrew creme called hummus, a great variety of salses, the falafel, which are molded garbage bottles, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of the city of Israel, there are no traveling dogs.
Instead, there are many well-food cats that "pass into their pleasure" in imponent way.
On the night you can see them sleeping even on the shoes of the parked cars.
Ronières love the concurrenced places and don't ́t golosin.
The winner of a car, depending on the mark, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) daily.
Besides the insurance, it's going for $15 per day.
And the acquirer of a bicycle will go out for 15 centuries a day.
The inputs to the museums cost a average of 30 centuries.
Israel in digits
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists worldwide.
Most of those who arrived to recruit the country and relaxed were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ucrainian tourists, which exceeds 51% at the same period of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will bring you to Moscow: the immigrants are worth for the tongue
While human rights lawyers and defenses discuss the consequences that would bring the Law on the mandatory examination, they have already appeared in the timer country that trade with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers come to Moscow, San Petersburg and other Russian cities.
In its majority, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tayikistán and Turkmenistan.
His only goal is to win money to help your families who have stayed home.
Since 1 December, a law enters into force, if each employee immigrant must conduct an examination to check its knowledge of the Russian language.
This rule is currently applicable only for those who are intended to work in the provisional sector, Community services institutions, household services and trade at least.
However, with time, as they promised in the Federal Imigration Service, the examinations will be made obligatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to review the language, if not also the Russian history and the basis of legislation.
The knowledge of the language should be confirmed even to receive and renew the labour authorisation.
The citizens of the countries in which Russia is the official language.
This law will not be subject to persons who have been able to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the resolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Use, fatality and defense of rights
The network of research centres will work by the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of the Amistance of the Pueblos, the State University of Moscow, the State University of San Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
The immigrants can be presented to tests in all cities, now in Russia are more than 160 centres of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by Members of the State Duma and by the Federal Imigration Service.
But the rights defenders, much before the law entered into force, have been able to make this question many times to the press: what will this actually bring?
What changes will the obligation of knowledge of the language, both for Russia and for their own immigrants?
First, the representatives of the Imigration Service respond, and this will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer "working slave".
Many people today speak about the defence of the rights of work immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tayikistán.
The defence of its rights should be started before its game.
Only a organized selection system will allow immigrant workers to solve the problem in 90% of the cases.
Problems have non-professional immigrants, education, who do not know the language, or who are in the medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev, the immigrant future will be condemned to find people without slaves who, with the pretext of help, put a "paid trip" to a speculator and is covacha, where he and twelve others are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a sinnumber of boxes from our immigrants.
"In their patriarch they promise one thing, but when they come, they are lied, their passengers, they don't pay them the promised salaries," confirms the Chief of the Tayikist Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't worry, Jeff!
However, while so many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country to which they want to go, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much of your fault but its own unfortunateness: the Turkmen, ozbek, tayikos that can be able to have a normal primary education.
This must be that your families even have nothing to give to children to eat, not talk about them anymore, calm them and buy them the need for the school.
When they come to adultery, these guys are going to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if the language is not known, they recognize them.
"One feels humble and lower."
However, regarding the language law, the rights defenders indicate a significant point.
The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have such status, there will be no review and, therefore, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or becoming the step to strangers"
Many visitors are not so easy to receive the official state in our country.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language in itself.
Furthermore, legalization costs money: from 12000 to 16000 rubbles.
However, an inscription can be made quickly and only for a thousand fifty rubbles.
Russian police employees know that we usually have documents, we are not inscribed and the cases of extortion appear.
"We ask hundred or two hundred rubbers for cigarettes or thee," the journalists recommended that Tayikistan citizen, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come, don't be tired, buy a painting."
On the first day of entry into force of the Language Law, it was shown that not only the registered documents of immigrants could be held.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been encountered by officers of the Federal Immigration Service.
The documents were printed in standard color printers.
Of course, they reached the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task to pass the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubblers.
This is two and a half more decent than the official examination procedure, which will cover the immigrant worker three thousand rubbles.
The main task for a future future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomes" cannot be purchased, converge government officers and rights defenders.
At the same time, the authorities may promise immigrant workers that could not have successfully passed the first time review to study the basic language course.
Furthermore, the immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not repeat active communication with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal weapons trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is very reduced
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to civil weapons owners.
This is the reaction of the government to the recent incidents: Shooting shoes during wedding celebrations in which there were no victims, and the massacre started by the Moscow Lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which seven people lost life.
The police wants to use and posure traumatic weapons in public places and to highlight the minimum age for the licence for weapons, from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Conflict against corruption, Irina Yarowaya, who promised that reforms in the Law on weapons position would be brought to the Duma of the State in a future.
Not everyone feels satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to cope with this problem by applying the "fortunate hand policy".
In the network, a open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social organisations of trainers, require that such "insensitive rigurosity" measures be removed.
The percentage of vandalism acts with registered weapons is minimum, recommended to the BBC news service, the criminal advocate Vasiliy Lésnikov.
Statistics of the Ministry of Interior have been committed for six months in 2012 142 crimes with fire weapons registered in the internal authorities, against the total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a stronger legislation in the civil weapons sector will not be an inconvenient in order to address the criminal to the black market.
Now, if you say your words, in Moscow you can find any weapons under price.
Meanwhile, in the Ministry of the Interior, the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from factories to officers
The black weapons market is located in several channels.
The main channels are years, says Victor Baranets, who worked in the Ministry of Education and High State for ten years.
Screenshot of the website accepting weapons requests
The first, "the host of the exercise or military" means the weapons that were stolen during military action in Caucaso.
"The weapons were struck by the Russian officers and the same caucasians," says Baranets.
The following type of black weapons, robbed by criminals and representatives of security forces.
Baranets explains that here are included the hurt weapons of the police stocks and those robbed right by the officers of the law's compliance bodies.
Illegal weapons come to sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals, there were often explosions.
"There are versions shown that some incendies have been caused premeditally to cover the deficiency," comments an exmilitar.
See Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand grain.
"Now they have proliferated private weapons factories that are not in the international market and distribute weapons under egg to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
A more source of black market is the contraband.
Many weapons and amateurs come from poor countries such as Kirgizistan.
"There they account with their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the weapons flow," explains the ex military.
Where's the weapons coming from?
Experts have calculated the advanced participation of each of these sources of illegal weapons delivery to the black market.
A report on this issue was drawn up in 2011 by the Centre for Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
The specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, the bibliography and public access data of ports whose thematics turns back to the weapons.
The majority of illegal weapons, researchers, come from armed forces and security forces.
The half of the black market weapons has arrived there "for the reason of officers whose work is related to the weapons," it is stated in the report.
Researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to " illegal archeology".
The dependent of one of the tents of weapons, who asked that his call was not mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not buyed anybody from a long time since they are too old.
More often, it says, the suppliers are guided to military stocks when they need a game.
In some holiday, the supplier buyes a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the valley.
"This brings the weapon to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two loaders," we account.
"But, of course, the police is both of all the matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan is to be fulfilled, they perform test buyes to illegal weapons tradeers," adds the department.
"How in a lush bottle"
The seller and the purchaser are going to be found at 日 of known persons.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed me to be on the "Begovaya platform", where I would be a man who would bring me to a "skin" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the weapon, I just heard there."
Military commentary Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," he says the department of the tent. "I have a friend like this, but I don't trust much in him."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also to come, let's say "of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked you to say that a dent to his daughter had fallen."
I can even get a couple of rail handbooks to a trusted person.
He also gives them to me only because he knows that I'm not going to deal with him.
News are looking for weapons in different ways.
The ex military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of illegal weapons buyer in the middle of 1990s, when a article was published on this subject.
The schemes, if their words are, haven't changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no "of everything".
"I felt like in a lush bottle," replies the military.
To the buyer, if it is words of Baranets, they don't offer a gat for freedom: everything there is possible to be tested.
I, as a potential client, not just buy; let's go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"I give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the weapon is shooting well, we start negotiating," the procedure describes the expert.
Sofa Title
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No personal documents or meetings are repeated for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the public warning "Buy a gun or a metrella".
There users make their requests and ask questions.
And they sell the minors of age?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (conserved).
"Buy the gun TT. Moscow," lacoonically formulates its question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fitting websites and capture two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
And the people go, as a hambridge fish to the pool, and then, to take carbon into Siberia
military commenter and exmilit Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: Generally, the website is registered outside the reach of the Russian laws.
People make the requests.
The purchaser makes the payment to 日 of an automatch.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reports the press secretary of the NGO "The right to the weapons," Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets that if a online request is made, one remains without gun and puts it into prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fitting websites and capture two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
"And people go, as a hambridge fish to the pool, and then, to take carbon into Siberia," he.
Makarov for $100
In buying illegal fire weapons, experts, one can be costed from $100 to $900.
See Dmitri Kislow of the NGO "The right to weapons", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100.300.
It must be expected for a month and a half.
It is sent from military storages by the middle rango heads.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, in comparison with the January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced to a 7%, which consists of 22.900, and the number of cases identified by furnishing and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosives and explosive artacts was reduced to 7.8%.
The employees of quick and supermarket restaurants are placed in the United States.
Even a fourth part of teenagers and adolescents find their first jobs as beds in "McDonald's"
In the last days, in the United States there has been an eye of protests against low salaries paid in Walmart corporation supermarkets and restaurants of the popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentitiesky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one is attracted to survive if he comes or doesn't come to the nine points, or if he has intended for forces and be enhanced in his first steps.
Protection actions are supported by syndicates and a number of left NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the payment modes of Walmart workers and the quick food system, the objective of protest organisations is the creation of workers' syndicates in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has not been practically occupied by the syndical movement.
Forty-six hundred feet per year?
The actions started last week, after the Day of Thanksgiving, the name "Black Virgins". That day, in the United States, he counciled the orgy of rebs that captured millions of people, and sometimes was accompanied of employment.
That day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, who employed 2,2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and made protest pickets at the staff of the staff of the corporation, whose products are guided to people of modesty and moderate income.
Walmart sells all, from bottles, hot rocks and battery for cars, even aspirers, eggs and milk.
Products in their tents are average between 8% and 27% smaller than the largest supermarkets.
That's why many badly paid workers of Walmart buy only in the work.
Walmart has made one of the largest corporations in America.
The words of two critical words, Walmart can be allowed to sell products to very low price, in part because they pay little to their workers.
These lasts are also deteriorated from bad work conditions, such as the lack of mounts or hand scanners.
This "Black Virgins" demonstration participants had increased salaries and was deceived that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation passed from $30 to $100 men.
For a typical worker of Walmart, who receives $9.5 per hour, this cost is worthwhile, they said.
Cients of the University of California in Berkeley suggest that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cover $3,2 billion.
This is approximately a 1,1% more than it costs in salaries now.
If Walmart places the salarial increase in the consumer's spots, each visit to the tent will result only 46% more decent.
In one year, they will cost the low amount of $12.39 more than they cost now.
Walmart partyers say satisfied that the protest had occurred only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss of corporation.
The Black Vingers was extended in its tents from the 8th afternoon of Thursday to the midnight of the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total, their registering boxes performed the "Black Virgins" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, stated at a interview on the Huffington Post website, who left his job "minder than five" employees of Walmart and that the protest was not more than "other trick of public relations", organized by the workers' syndicate.
"That's free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not exactly the major Walmart almacenes (which in this progressist city does not appreciate them, and therefore there is no one for now), but the "McDonald's" and other small restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells thousands of millions of parts, and then if they don't give you the low for illness and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the municipal Council of New York
Currently, in accordance with the federal law and the New York law, the minimum payment is $7.25 per hour.
Quick food restaurants will increase it with time, but only lightly, and in the middle, workers receive $8,90 per hour in New York.
No one wins less than they in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, it's something incomprehensible for me.
There was a time when almost the fourth part of the teenagers and adolescents passed through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the showers, partly after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Some were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm constantly troubled in some interviews with McDonald's workers who's demanding that they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal, there is a comment that the author indicates that it is unresponsible to have children if he doesn't know how to eat them.
The participants in the protests, who began at 6:30 on Thursday morning at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, were able to pay at least 15 dollars per hour, or double their current minimum salary.
In the rapid food sector, there were also workers' syndicates.
The U.S. Law prohibits administration to prevent this right and punish the activists of syndicate movement with arguities and disappointments.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates life.
However, for objective reasons, it is easy for the syndicates to ship the food sector.
One of the mains is the staff's severe rotation.
Discording
Ruidose protests occurred at the same day in other small restaurants of Manhattan.
The middle of the middle of the Mithin at the McDonald's nearby Times Square, in which several local democratic politicians participated, especially the member of the Municipal Council of the town Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says he is selling thousands of millions of parts, and then if I don't give you a hospital or paying you for your honest work."
The demonstrators received support from other democratic deputy in New York, such as the candidate at the town of Bill de Blasio, who said, "We must support the workers of the quick food sector so that they can receive just salaries and the economic prosperity of every new Yorkian."
As the New York Times magazine described, this was the most manifestation of this guy in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people were involved in it, even not all of them were employed by the quick food service, in which they worked decades of thousands of people in New York.
It's not yet clear if this will serve as a chispa to cause a massive movement.
"For now, lifting the brain isn't so easy."
The theme of the increased reality, so popular among modern technologies, is recently understood with normality mainly to the pregnancy of special birds.
At the beginning of the summer, at his annual conference, Google showed a model in movement and later, in November, was aware that Microsoft had also submitted a request to reclamate the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the leader of the 3D interactive technology group in the Microsoft de Cambrie, Izadi Sharamom, was diluted that for the scientists of that company, the birds already belonged to a past stage.
They are attractive to the perspective of manipulation of air-handed objects and the creation of open spaces.
- Please, in general, what is the subject of study of your research group?
- We dedicate ourselves to the interaction of the individual-ordinator, but we are also trying to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now, mankind in its large mass has been arrested in the work stage with the pixels of the plane screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look at 5-10 years ago and deal with cardiac changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and no Xbox is selling without Kinect today, since everyone is interested in the control of gests.
- What else is the future for us?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, a large part of this still happens in a plain screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work in really tridimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
It must be freed from the world of informatics to our, physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space that is around it.
Then we can complete the real world with objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the devil with those stupid real real calciums!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they're surprising it?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a pancea, it is able to solve the issue of privacy, because it does not always want others to hear about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not of slow movements, but of shorter.
Furthermore, the gests were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a puzzle that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it's very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a pulser hour.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example of gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda side?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- Or do you want to force users to adapt to what you can or can't do the machine now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in a future we will have to work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that can determine the reactions of the person.
These may, for example, be laser sensors, because they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect Sensors, what do you have about the modern cameras?
Do you miss resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the present generation is what may be the beginning of our work with tridimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of matrix and in depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not enough good for us; this gives more work to the designers of algorithms.
Or, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes but also in Z.
The speed is also important, the number of tables per second.
Human movements are very dynamic and the current 30 fps are really escape, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Family in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable delay for processing from 1 to 100 ms and must be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not all understand how this affects human-ma-ma-interaction.
I would be very useful for my work a balance of this device, but it would not re-react contact to the tables for second.
- And don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually the infrared rays and the second the recipient of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of diaposon →.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or in contrast, it increases and increases the amount required of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the tridimensional position.
- That's why I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, hasn't presented your bottles to the public.
Doesn't it seem that, from the view of the daily use of realistic technologies, the birds are one of the most ≥ platforms?
- Of course, to pass all the mouse by supporting up a smart phone in the hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could pass from the walls to the smart phone,
The birds are very personal devices, in that it is your strength (the private things only you can see), but also their weakness: an increased reality based on wallets will not allow you to work on objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of holographic objects in the air is not only available for Tony Stark from the "Iron Man" movie but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics suggest: There is no tactical answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think it could be the eighth of tactical feelings.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting trucs is the use of the second hand as a support quality for the image.
Register the tact perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually guided to bring tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is given a feeling similar to which one feels if someone was soft in the hairs of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also pulses for the powder that affect the nervous terminations of the fingers, this also promises a direction.
- Did you try to miss the brain?
Does he make him think he feels what it seems to feel at the time he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't done it yet.
Here is another challenge with which we have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically where it is in a very reduced space thinks he goes to an open space, almost unfinished. We are also working on the idea of the kitchens to run (not as the gimnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as the gigantic globes.
For now, it doesn't result so easily, it's still to work for many years.
That is what makes an attractive work with the reality of researchers, which many things are located in a total conception state.
Subject personal pleasure instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the "Vanguardism of San Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front, to the vanguardian of the art and culture.
In this list of the best figures of the art and the scene of San Petersburg are found, whose achievements come outside the city: they often find recognition in Europe without that Russia knows them if it does.
The new heroe of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, a barbed man dressed up-to-door red man, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Sean Garden or at mode and inevitation meetings.
Kirill Miller's tables always attach to ́s, where they want to be shown.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociofilosophers in San Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a representative of San Petersburg's vanguardism at the end of the 80s - the principles of the 90s.
Moreover, he is a city man whose appearance in the streets of the city is awake in the smiled people and rise up to all the state of encouragement.
Recently, he took in his hand a organile and became the organiser of San Petersburg, because he was mature to make such a difficult role, for his existence of bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the red town, not from yellow or Turkish, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a mode designer and I'm devoted to the appearance and image.
In this world, red color is a commitment between artist, image creators and society.
Although in the society, everything that is not a little gris produces aggressiveness and agitation of nothing good property.
But my challenges are addressed to start a conversation.
All the story of my provocative actions is a invitation to the debate.
- What do you understand you should be artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my jobs were shown.
I realized that it was my way.
Then the oil of old non-official artists had completed, and the new, free like me, were still incompatible.
I made me a friend of artists of the new wheel, with the following to those exposed to Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wheel is already finished.
I put me in the theater by the clothes, the music of all kinds, but not by letters.
And all this was joined in your art Clinics... - I was important to find me in the cultural centre of San Petersburg, where the best creatival minds should be gathered together.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of San Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sing light songs under fonogram, weeping adjusted pantalons, among them was the currently as moda Igor Vdovin.
When the group eats to play alive, he became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-Galivski.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Galeria "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the rest of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and aid customers.
I'm a hero in the past century, when culture means something.
In 2000, the survey was made in the press, the premium was "The people of our city."
In the name "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times, it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who loves truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our time, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity will be separated. One can be popular but very little worshipped.
- There's something recognized in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the presentation and event are clearly expressed.
I'm going to make a planned exhibition, "The Russian Museum in payments."
Payments are an attempt category.
I was so social, but now being so is painful and terrible.
But in payments everything is embarrassed and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the big, I have big ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a total and mandatory clothing change.
Now one follows it by the clothes, orients on the outside, but not within the person.
And maybe that person is not worth or gives his hands, but swim in his face.
And the liar will be removed when it changes clothes.
We've seen you in the town organizer's role. - A worshipped city must have a hero like this.
Who's better than me to be!
- All right, but can the best business art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have tact.
We are witnessing to the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped in manades, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the other simplions.
Now all have been divided into microcommunities, it's hard to please all.
I'm not a $100 currency to like everyone.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, every heroe of worship has 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov, they come for thousands!
- They'll see him abandoned, there the sex-social area works.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is marked.
I have my fans, the most important is not to hurt them, not to get out what you got.
When he was young, he made such tables that a collectionist had them on the wall at the side of Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people generally end.
Now they often confund the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, this is another story.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they denied money only to pin images.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with San Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: Culture officer.
But not all of them can be dedicated to culture.
When the kings were the right things were in other ways, the kings might not understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to maintain the right experts.
Now there are very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in San Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a high level that evaluate them correctly and open their way.
Now it's prospering the subject personal pleasure.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to search for other museums.
- What's for you San Petersburg?
- San Petersburg is not a cultural capital.
But on our rocks it's hard to grow.
We need cultural area and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are many interesting people who go to exposures and concerts.
In our case, this class is infim.
We have to make the art of moda, as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project will be implemented with a subvention of San Petersburg.
Give light in space
The earth is in danger.
Global calamity or chock with a murder asteroid.
Space vessels with humans on board are part in search for a repository planet.
To maintain mankind is the main question: How can the species continue in conditions of ingravity or in the same repository planet?
I think there's nowhere to choose.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypotheticly.
"These are Venus and Marte," says the leader of the State Astronomy Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in March are better for life, the temperature is 500 degrees in the surface of Venus.
You can only live at big heights or in Venus' orbit... in the space.
It is eaten to cope with the playing problems in the space with the flower.
A half centuries ago, experiments have been carried out with plants.
Four generations of orbital guests were not different in any of the earthly varieties.
Then came the creation of insects in the orbita, small muscles of the fruit, drosophiles.
In 1979, codorniz eggs were sent to space to check how embryo is developed in ingravity conditions.
We get a normal pollution as a result.
But then they start the problems.
"The problem is that this pollution has to find support, it must keep on its own feet and begin moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Scientist Aämmia.
With no support, pollutants would turn back to azar.
And after 10 hours in recent birth, a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
The pollutors did not react to light or sound.
And unfortunately, at four days they just died.
"And two times we got to be born by the pollutants, but then we left it because it was impossible to work with them," says Vladimir Sychev on the failure of experiment with pollutants in the space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.
At the early 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, in the "Bion" biosatellite they will only travel in species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with mouse, which was sent to space already with fats.
At first, nothing overnatural was found.
"This was exactly in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be done," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After the territory, the space mouths had seed.
However, it has not yet been able to address the problem of reproduction right in the space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, in their habitual habit, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
The man, however, in the contrary to the small animals, in the beginning, can.
The Homo ́ens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional fund.
Similar experiences are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have traveled to space for 50 years ago.
The biggest risk occurred by Tereshkova.
And the most else you have humankind is the female body.
Our gaviote flying, and no one on the earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You can or don't have a baby after this flight.
"Thereafter, no one has answered this question," comments the Vakhtang Space Sector's veteran.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonauta woman, Valentina Tereshkova, bore a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonauta.
In 1988, the second cosmonauta woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was two times in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk was persuaded.
We are little, the astronautes are counted to who after long flights all have been well done, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarises the Cosmonaute pilot, the Heroe of the Soviet Union, Russian heroe, Valery Polyakov.
However, humankind should seek some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial seriousness.
The workshop of the Cosmonate Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In the condition of nul flotability, cosmonautes practice their ability to work in the space.
The water simulates ingravity.
If for a adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still enemy, for a newborn child is its birth element.
Small men and women seem to be confirmed that life on the earth has come from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is found about 9 months within his mother in the amniotic liquid, because it will be easier to be used after water.
In the beginning, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the first bathroom only pass 2 weeks.
"This is very little to give advantage of something," says Marina Aksenova, monitoring of birth of recently born.
In summary, if ingravity is a more natural state for a newborn, women need gravity, gravity force.
In the ingravity of the abdominal muscles and the pelves are decrepted very quickly, the exhaust ability of the fat is reduced.
Well, let's forget that, trusting the action of stimulants for birth.
Of course, you can light in a special camera, it's gonna pull it up.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov is making this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial seriousness.
Without feeling of seriousness, the body does not generate the squelet or muscle system.
A recently born in orbita is impossible to cloth it with a special tragedy for training, such as adults.
It'll simply take care of what's vital for him.
"And this experience that we will do together, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will give place to bring us to the Earth to a disappointed person, to a totally unadaptated person," provides the head of the Bioetics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Scientist Aymmia, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in the space is a theoretical issue.
However, with time this will be a reality, when humans in their ships are directed to a remote planet that will be the house for their children born in the space.
Chief of NKU: The inspection of the "swarc" system has not been given with the guilty policy
With regard to public adjudications, the Republic of Czech accounts for good inspectors and a quality legislation, although its application is covered.
This is Miloslav Kala, president of the Office de Control Suprema (NKU) in an interview for Currently.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we miss," described the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of a wrong practice, Peter Netime refers to the system of being autonomous only on the paper, which is known as the "svarc system".
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not molester businessers with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in any way and if it prohibits something, in that case, not the President of the Government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out those controls or obligations," Kala states.
In the Committee on Control at the Congress of the Members, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and the German team, in the context of which the law was compared with public adjudications in both countries.
What is exactly?
It's a parallel control we've started to perform about two years ago.
It is simplified: European legislation regulates how public adjudications should be organized, and it follows the legislation that exists in each country and then practices in itself.
We have joined everything and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. In general, the legislation of our country is "restricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to include more strict rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.
What can this project actually offer? What do you think are the conclusions?
Exactly a common control of this type could help us to stop investing efforts in the creation of laws, reduction and improvement of limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of the emergency means to achieve an appropriate thing to a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, at the long time, criminal action.
But not because of reducing the limits of adjudications, it means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is satured with so much "paper", that those who want to find errors in the system can easierly do it than if the limits remain as high as now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of law governing the practice of public adjudications.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it a Office like our NKU or is it organized otherwise?
As for the offices, such as the NKU, the Bundesehof (Federal Tribunal of Accounts), with a similar organization to our, with a college, the only is that in its case it is a way so different, but at the beginning both offices evolutionally.
Competitions are also an analogic point, however, since Germany has a federal organization, the account courts are even at this level, and in this regard it is clearly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control the federal money, which we call here State funds.
The public funds, managed by the regions and municipalities, are there, in Germany, controlled by the Federal Court of Accounts.
As regards local legislation, is it more simple than our?
In general, I would not like to set a comparison without specific data, however, Germany is still a model in some aspects, but it cannot be precisely needed in what it is better.
Could it be better, for example, regarding the quality of inspectors?
I'm sure not, but I repeat, I don't like to do this kind of comparison.
It is necessary to say that even those countries we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it wasn't so, they wouldn't have any benefit to cooperate with our office, don't you think?
As regards the law of our country, what did the amendment of law on public adjudications mean for its Office?
Taking into account that the period of validity of this amendment is short, it has not yet been shown in control actions.
Since we do ex post controls, we have to count with a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the future control preparation process: we have started a new tool of "not-economic risk detection", which we have made for almost 14.000 public adjudications, which have been analysed. Changes will be completely reflected here, since the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection process and similar are corrected.
Do you think that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, the bureaucratic system provides an embarrassment?
I think this law is probably a step in the right direction and I hope that it is.
The problem that may occur is that the legislation is "during" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
In the previous legislation, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the regional operational programmes of the regional consequence), and each law not respected for public adjudications means violation of budgetary disciplina.
Does it mean then to endure the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or use it and not punish those who commit an formal failure, who are not able to take decisions.
A system of this type will only be able to create a greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how's it getting out of this?
We'll see where this way leads us to.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not molestrate businessers with controls of the Swarc system, regarding the fact that they were autonomous only on the paper. What does this mean?
Is the Swarc system allowed or allowed?
The law should be regulated in any way and, if it prohibits something, not if the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out those controls and to make obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but it can't say that we're going to do as if nothing.
In the law on public adjudications, the legislation is very strict about how to act formally, and this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not compliance with the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we miss.
The roads have ice plates, even though most of them are transitable
In several places of the Czech Republic, the roads present ice and snow plates.
Although most of the ways are transitable, some should be exhausted.
Karlovy Vary region
Today the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transible, but they had ice and snow maps.
The temperature falls down and will dark between five and ten degrees below zero.The day the termometres will be lightly up.
He has left noise in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine.
In contrast, in the crossings of the Metal mountains, the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still bad because of the cloud, information from the control centre of operations of the roads of the region.
The rapid R6 road and the first category road in the region are now transiible without restrictions.
However, precaution is recommended, especially in some pounds whose surface can be frozen and balanced.
Moreover, all roads of second and third category, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still traces with ice and snow remaining.
It is necessary to increase attention on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads of East Bohemia, there is a danger of iron and higher areas and in the mountains there may have been a snow street on the roads, reporting on your pages the Road Direction and Auto Travel.
Road operators warn the drivers about the danger of ice plates, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
They can be produced frozen in Lanškrouna, Usti nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Highokego Myta, and especially in the roads of second and third category.
The routes I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains of Krkonosche and Orlical Mountains.
There is a snow snow board in the highest streets of the roads in Rychnov's municipalities over Kněeu and Trutnov.
In the area of the East Bohemia, the sky will be today between clear and partly cloudless, without precautions.
The temperatures will generally be weakened between three under zero and a positive degree, a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transible today morning, although the precaution must be exhausted and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the first hours of the morning, temperatures will be dark between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the neighborhood and the later decline of temperatures, some ways could also be ice herbs.
In some places, the drivers will be found with noble, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is what is discovered from the information of the Road Operations Centre.
The D5 autopise is almost transible without restrictions, even though it is recommended to extinguish precaution, especially in the way between 80 and 13m
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and without ice.
In the street area of Pilsen and Tachov frontiers with Germany may have traces with ice plates.
The ways of second and third category are humid, so in this case, it is also warned of trames with ice plates.
The drivers should be more decent, especially in the less transited ways in the area of Shumava.
Olomo region
The drivers leading to the highest areas of the Olomo region will be found with partly deceased snow.
After the chemical treatment, there remained still snow at the door of Chervenohorské and on the road in direction to Videlský cross.
Road operators removed the snow during the night; in the Straight of Shumper, about three centimeters of snow, the guides were collected.
In the rest of the region, most of the ways are transiible without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of Shumper's road, there are remaining snow.
The drivers at the Port of Chervenohorské will be found with a medium-sneak snow in direction to Jesenik," has confirmed today a Shumper Road Administration Operator.
On the ground and night, their colleagues also arrived to Jesenicka and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now cleaned and mixed.
In the Olomo Road, the ways are transitable without restrictions, the drivers in Sternberska should carry care of the forest streams, where the roads are still humid.
Region of Usti nad Labem and Liberec
Operators of North Bohemia's roads have informed about complications in different traces at the first hour of the morning.
Besides some places in which you have sown or frozen, the police database is the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Usti nad Labem region closed.
The temperatures remain under zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow are obviously in the calzad. In the lowest areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central macis, there are no problems and roads, generally, are sack.
No service complications have been registered by the opinion.
Road operators have warned about ice presence in the Netherlands.
It is the horologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night.The day is expected to rain and snow to go down and the night the heaven will be cleaned and there will be ice.
Since the General Roads have been announced disapproval conditions in road I/13, within the border between the region of Usti nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that were arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Simon Ornest: In our concerts we want to buy positive energy
It is said that in less than one month the end of the world, what do you think about it?
It's just one of the other alarmist news to which we like to take us.
The Tap Tap music group we like better to broke on this and we like to say that we are the only group of music in the world that can assemble enough positive energy to put the end of the world or avoid it.
Moreover, in December you organize a real original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It is a stately benefit that we have been planning for two years ago.
We decided to use the marketing potential that has the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11:10 tomorrow.
The previous day, on 20 December to 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at the same time when the Maya calendar ends on the Kiribati Island in the Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen?
Initially, it was my idea, then we flew forwarding the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
Besides wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with the society, on the state where we will leave the world to our children.
With the end of the Maya calendar, we also created a single collection of articles: bottles, boxes, bottles, and original laveres against the end of the world that can be purchased on www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, together with other interpreters, also sang the called himno against the end of the world, which leads by the title "The end of the world, cancelled".
It's currently very popular in YouTube, can you hear in benefits?
Of course, yes, and it'll be just the last, well, when everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
The Himnos will be linked simultaneously thanks to the special transmission directly in the Czech Television.
Tomas Hanák wrote the letter of this song and interpreted the protagonist role of Jesus in the videoclip, where Xindl X also sing...
How did this cooperation occur?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, except to organize many benefits and concerts...
We have all our efforts to participate in this project.
Most of them have been shown that they are interested in and divorced to work with us.
What will the money recovered in the concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment for the educational centre without students, which we ended in its sixth consequent year with the civil Tap association in Jedliczkovv institution.
Students of the Jedlikkovv school regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they do fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient economic means to pay the teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the context of the conclusion of works in Jedličkuv established, there will be an independent building to which we will follow with this project.
In each concert, several groups and interpreters are acting.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop an attractive programme for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will act Chinaski, Lesbiens Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
To get more details, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Have you planned any other "spectacular" action in the future?
In May, we will act for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so we will certainly prepare an attractive program with interesting invitations.
The year that comes would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall of New York and me, personally, using that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans in the foreign are not exactly minimalists, even now you have acted in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disability.
How is the logistics and organization of these travels?
It's not so hard as it can look first.
There are five members in the rubber of the rubber, the chairs must travel in the rubber for equipment, and we also take a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, until now we have arranged them well. The CHSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surprising me.
Even in Moscow, where we've been back a while, everything went out without problems.
Thanks to the outcomes to the foreign, you can compare the various aspects of society to disability and other aspects.
What have you found up to now?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses that, in east, there is a lot of way to run.
In contrast with Praga, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still uncommon that a person moves alone through the city center in a roadsheet of the roads.
Something so running as it is, for example, to give preferred to someone in the wheel in the ascensor, there it isn't.
Happily, a civil association has been created to discuss the problems of people with disability.
In what ways should we take examples of developed countries?
There are many aspects in which we're going back...
But it is important to mention that the perfection and improvement of the situation always depend on those who are directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious disability are moved through their public account and can go to the service, to the museum where they want...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disability participate in social life actively, in this regard, with the Tap Tap Let's go a little ahead!
A respectful or without barriers society is a thing, but when the time comes in which sports, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come to change all the truth.
Even now, there are isolated cases of people who have a great willing force.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as a trainer in Jedličkov's station, where many young people around me wanted to dedicate to something.
And since I'm a musician, I'm playing, among other things, the saxon, I found an amateur group with a worker.
And with the time, as our moderator Ladya Angelovicz says, it was a little of our hands (Laughter).
However, popularity hasn't come to these last years, or do I wrong?
It is true that it helped us very much to connect to famous songs and to work actively to promote the group.
We have concluded that the work that it is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the assistance of the European Union, we can also allow a quality teacher, equipment, etc.
Did you want to get so far with the Tap Tap?
Since the beginning, I saw the potential that there was, that something could be done in other ways.
The world of the spectacle is filled with things that seem to each other.
It's logical, in its way, all the news are attached carefully and lately long to accept.
There's a few extraordinary things, but I think the Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disappointment are not abandoned that suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop with it, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something comes good to people with disability, then it is not just a progress for them, but for all society.
Did you help the fact that you are a needed boss, as many people describe to him?
If we want to do a quality work, we must be rigorous in many aspects and do some discipline.
I think it's totally normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when they hear that they have to come two days to test, go to the preparation test and pass a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial eufory leaves them quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in each group who wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group now has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lady Angelovič.
We're a open group, people come and go out, they can't be avoided.
Whoever is willing and wins will always find open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place in the Prague Arena Incheba, Fléda de Brno and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the video conference watch to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The objective of the concert is to gather the resources necessary to finance multifunctional educational equipment from the STUDEO without barriers in Jedličkuv Institute of Prague, which costs 25 million Czech crowns.
The entry to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free income in the pre-selling option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
In the Ministers of the European Space Agency's countries last week, Poland was accepted as a dual member of the ESA. It is the second Member State of the ESA of the former East Europe block, after the Czech Republic, who became a member on 12 November 2008.
Poland started intense cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in the Committee on Agency Projects during the years later.
However, the way of Poland to the cosmos begins much before.
The Poland Enthusiastes were already dedicated to the flights to space before the Second World War, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the Conference of A. Sternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Varsovia, which, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the "Induction to Cosmonatic".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left indiferent assistants and, years later, Sternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld received the premium Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to Cosmonatic".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, became a great impulsor of astronomy and cosmonatic.
He published hundreds of articles in the Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this cientical discipline.
Gadomski became a promotor of the cosmonatic, was known worldwide, and its contribution to science was seen re-absorpted when one of the cosmonatic craters of the hidden face of the moon was set up.
In 1925 it was built in Poland a dress that would be provided by a cocktail engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the project's comments are also not known.
It is not clear whether the cohete would be used for the switching of the dress or for its brake.
The information on this tissue is limited to the collection in the pressure of the time.
Since 1933, the Poland artillery is empowered to dedicate to the missions.
The research was financed by the Techniki Cell Uzbrojennia in collaboration with Professor Miečislawem Wolfkem and Professor Gustavem Mokrickiegim.
From the conservated material, it is evident that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 it appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photo-electric mixture designed by the Rohoziński engineer and the next year was published the study "Rakieta - Torpeda poõna and raketobomba aeroplane", author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of mixture engines.
Short before war, the Advisory Committee for the Provisory Action (Timzeitary Committee Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missional technology for military use and coordinated all works.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other cosmonutic studies appeared in the Polish press after war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautic (Polski Astronautic Society).
In November 1954, the magazine Problemy is first referring to the company with four very very articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Professor Subotoviče, the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonatics was proposed.
At that time, projects of artificial satellite were already implemented and was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future perspectives.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) was encouraged to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (based in 1951) and at the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first President of the PTA, Kazi Méd Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was the President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He performed this charge until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM Sonda Cohete (Weather Request) that was successful and became the first Poland cohete in which a citizen research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was launched for the first time on 10 October 1958.
The cohete had an apogeo of 1.800 metres, about 80 cm length and did not reach the 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 the air tests of the RM-2 cohetes of two stages in the wilderness of Buldov were started.
The average cohete was 1,4 meters and weighed about 11,5 kg.
Another type of developing cohete would be a real scientist study. The RM-34 cohete would have a 14,5 km apogeo and its mission would be to control the wind of the height.
However, the works were suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM cockets was the Meteor-1 cohete, which was built during the 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as two stages cohetes, with a total length of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different from the space available for scientific devices.
The available space for volume was 0.4 litres in the meter-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum apogeo in the three types was 37 km.
between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 cohete was developed in the Air Institut, whose first air tests were started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 cohete had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to take a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km height.
The version of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 was later built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the training of the CoSPAR National Committee two years later.
In the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the research of the Cosmic Space on Soviet Artificial Satellites and, in 1978, the Polandian pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaute after Vladimir
The suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the social work law.
The resolution was aware of a close discussion in the society.
Since then, it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a larger point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less legislative competition.
This means, therefore, that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict.
The cause is found in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited private capital movement, together with the unfree financial speculation.
The impact of large differences on the work cost (of the salaries) produces economic pressures.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of bart goods, brings distances to the price of the competitor, with the aim of making it with the majority of the market and thus increases its margin of benefits.
A large scale means, for the majority of businessmen, transfering the production to the foreign, buying a smaller or well off there. The result is a higher unemployment in those countries in which the price of work, in comparison with other economics, is higher.
Since the private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, it is not responsibility for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, it is necessary to increase the social expenditure of the state.
All of this situation provides the total disapproval of the enterprises by paying taxes and compensating economic and social damage that have caused them to gain benefits.
The situation is universally so known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The low-supluous practices of the private capital create, in certain economys, the governments of those countries are committed to competite with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attaching foreign capital to the country.
Otherwise, governments provide private capital for their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is made particularly patent in the changes of existing laws.
The goal is to oblige the population to accept the opinion of the private capital, especially in respect of the salaries.
This is, by one hand, the economic obligations system in the case of long-term unemployment, and by the restricted right of employees in relation to work rights.
The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the differences between poor and rich.
Since a few years ago, there are points of delivery of food for poor people who cannot maintain their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid already comes to millions.
In the context of the growth of the German economy, a very common case occurs: people employed with a loan so low that the state should pay the rest to reach the minimum insufficient to survive.
This type has been published as a scandal related to the situation of the German Federal Parliament's assistant employees.
The measures of emergency of nearly all states of the EU in the southern state are not doubtless leading to the same situation; people, pressed by a bismal decline of their social level, are obligated to emigrate as in the 19th century or to deal with a bad salary at the border of the society, with the hope that it comes to the private capital investor country on a day.
Is it necessary to ask where he comes?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilians, Turkish, Marokkians, Egyptians or Africans continues to work for an infinite part of a European salary.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and communications means to the sathet that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which leads to the economy's failure.
The private capital defenses the state that the state should not intervene in the economy by providing control.
Thereafter, it is necessary to ask if the private capital does not affect its selfishness in the political course and, on the other hand, in all the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly effective.
The test is the existence of lobbys, in very powerful and universal practice, in all states.
The result is an unexpected situation that is shown in the field of corruption, in mutual favors, in a legislation which is practically reversible in all parts but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is the following: State ministers, with lack of financial means, are responsible for the editing of law projects to private legal undertakings, which are often linked to the industry.
This type of law projects are adopted later in Bundestag, the German Parliament.
In this way, the whole power does not evade the people, as it is declared in the Constitutions of Western Democraties, but on the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracy with a liberal orientation is quickly found in a situation as Appianos described in his work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of César and Pompeya: "State had time to disintegrate and administrations were occupied with force."
In turn, the benefits obtained illegally and the help to finance stones or stones.
The sovereignty and corruption were extended without prejudice and the people came to the urns with the vote of before-hand"... "no people with character to appeal to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consules"... "Emp · speaking seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energy man"... While Appianos thought in Pompeya, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever in autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in anti-equity, is that the current society is based on unconscious preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not able to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as the of then, an elite's responsibility, without making an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the growth of fascist and communist regimes should therefore be looked for in the disfellowshipped liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a defined pause, in the expectation of the next fight.
The fact that the current elite is completely ignoring the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have been witnesses, as well as the crimes against mankind, as we know them in the old history and the most recent.
The suspension of the law on public adjudications is not the solution; at least not long-term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international level and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue seeking other ways to reduce the population's social level.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution passes by concrete sociopolitical reforms, which aim both to participate in the capital of the state and the influence of citizens in the government and to debilite the position of the private capital monopolie in the society in favour of the state.
Israel: the chaos.
"That doesn't eat from violence and never could" (Not rise from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose stribillo reveals "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (We don't see the fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be no" Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his death lake in 1849.
After the last oil of violence between Israel and Gaza's bridge, different reactions have occurred, as always.
One, from Israel, arguments for the right of self-defense and encampment of the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, the other supports the Palestinians and calls on racism by Israel's state, genocid against Palestinian Arabs and takes Israel of terrorism.
I don't want to focus on who's guilty of the killings that are periodically repeated and who is the victim, and at the end, the citizens of today in Israel, including the autonomous territory, were born within the current political situation and did not live the instructions of violence.
My intention is to offer the readers a look behind the hall, a look to discover who benefits from the pressures that have been drawn from 95 years ago (recovered from the Balfour statement in November 1917) in a small area of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, other in conclusions that I have reached on my own way to understand the matter, on who or what group of people is the main impulsor of the events of the modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of fighting for power is in the first row.
At every time we can find a Great Alejandro or a Napoleon.
But what is not so clear is if these characteristics were always those who directed their steps automatically or if behind his throne there was someone who guided his actions to a certain goal.
We accept that we live in a time that focuses the world's riches in the hands of some individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this involves has not been able to reach one generation.
From these astronomically rich families, one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I'm not rejecting it): the Rothschilds.
It's not written much close to them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century, they purchased the first news agency (Reʹs) to stop associating their name with a lot of serious crimes. The power and richness, or both, would cover their shoes, which always means a strengthening.
They have important participations in almost all the central responsibility of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, it has been declared or prepared a war: before the attack in Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after Iraq's attack, they were five, only four, but Russia has submitted the central responsibility to the Russian government.
Everyone who has opposed this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschild, empe · during the Secesion War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK eat printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was murdered in 1963; the congressist Louis McFadden was in 1936 revengeed after he wanted to ask the FED because he had deceived the great economic crisis of 1929.
Her view of the world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to bring a plan with three world wars designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated by the 33th degree.
The first war was marked as a goal to eliminate the large monarch states throughout Europe; the second wanted to remove the colonial surface, especially from Great Britain, and the third was proposed to reduce the population of the land between a half million and a billion people (like a number of slaves for their welfare and lush would be enough and would not consume so many resources) as well as the creation of a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than a project for such solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschild, follows the dinamic of the crisis discovery and the later offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong, and they always take a deterioration of the situation. If not, just remember that the FED was created so that a crisis would not be repeated as the year of 1907.
So after the success of the inheritance of the heritage to the Australian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after that the First World War was deceived, they destroyed Zarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolchevic revolution.
The First World War ended repeatedly and unjustified from the military and economic viewpoint, the capital of Germany (the wars to end with Zarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the later discovery of the great power of Central Europe, the Austrian Hungarian empire.
To prepare the Territory of the Second World War, bankers and politicians allowed to create, in so far, a conflicting situation based on the vast war reparations imposed on Germany, which created the optimal conditions for radicalization of the empowered masss. Then, they were able to serve the Germans the solution of Führer, which was sufficiently strong and simple and indicated to guilty, and then to build a Checoslovakia composed by several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and so well represented the function of the fifth column, which took the call and caused the stream of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild impulsed the foundation of the sionist movement, a branch that focused on the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (come to Syon).
The Balfour statement mentioned earlier sent the bases for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestinian and began the first conflicts with the Arabian population.
There were terrorist attacks in both parts.
The Second World War: It is difficult to know whether Hitler took too much of the oil to which the international bankers had attached it in a principle or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration fields created optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially found in 1948 and, in similar manner, the war reparations made to Germany increased the way to the Second World War, with the announcement of the state of Israel, focused on a third war.
If international bankers could start it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the first line of fight, now together with the Arabic population or, generally, the Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is a great eye, a soldier and caos machine, not only in the framework of his country but also at international level.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian and Israeli conflict? Where does injustice generate injustice in an interminable spirit of violence, if at the beginning the code of some individuals and their view for the world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandataries, because, as it is in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, which makes everything possible to declare war to Iran and considers Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Chine, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we have noticed, Iran controls the stress of Ormuz, where the 20% of all the world oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles width), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light is now shown the words David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a pound of people who are part of the well-appealed financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted by a chip when he is born that controls all his being.
"And all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, must have a mark in the hand or in front, not to buy or sell, unless they bring the name of this monster or the numbers of their name.
It is necessary to understand: who has two fingers in front, which sums the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-six."
Argo movies: If you're getting cruel, call me to Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamic Students manifested the American ambassador in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as rehenes.
It was free to be in turn to the detronated shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, the country that had patrocinated his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation would not offer any positive perspective: to draw shah through the border, it could not be allowed, because, if it had done, it would have threatened the confidence of its aliens in other countries.
But the freedom of the rehens in Iran, where the revolution had been disemployed in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not at its disposal.
It was a fight against the prestigiation of the United States, which later intensified more with the failure of freedom of rehenes by force.
The detained diplomatics were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Government of Algeria.
In the United States, its destination caused a solidity and animation oil against Iran.
The failure in Iran was decisively contributed to Jimmy Carter's destruction before Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The "Argo" film of the director and actor Ben Affleck subjects an episode of this story, which produced a small success for America.
Soon before the ambassador was occupied, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, he was convinced to take them out of Iran, which helped a extravagant story: they went out with Canadian passengers, as members of the cinematographic team that examined the location in the country for the surproduction of a superproduction of science fiction.
Genre Combination
The plan that the expert in "exfiltation" Toni Mendez would require Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to seem true, the lying was written on the cinematographic project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, ficticial production society had even a real discharge.
The details of the operation have been secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
The Affleck movie is a unique combination of various types.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; one called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went out well, a liar (a example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film is combined with animosity states. We find well documented sequences in Teheran. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photographs of the events, which were placed in the same way in the movie; there are no many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, the typical scenes of Hollywood are so more Livian, marked by ironia and a low exageration.
Moreover, scenes of the central of the → and other institutions: men brought to analyze the situation in the negotiations table, in the Office's ships, by phone...
Ben Affleck has been able to restart his career in a fine way.
The actor, who had been objected to bulls, has become a respectable director and his way of action has stopped to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is its third width, after "Small Adios, Adiós" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Ladrones" (2010).
At the same time, it's the first film of Affleck where the action doesn't happen in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Furthermore, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that was for ancient film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Teheran is "red" in Canada.
The best film scenes are located in the streets, in the rebuilding of the true action. The introductory sequence of the capture of the ambassador is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the disagreement and of the lack of previsions that occurs when, in some place, the story gives a step forward.
Affleck and its partners have similar effect on the ficticity scenes (the taxing team in the Teheran baser).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a explained story does not offer much in the sense of cinematographic of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes he adds something to the reality: here isn't all so elegant (the scene in which the crisis is covered in the port of Teheran, the deviation of a call to America, and the defeated search after its track becomes a fool).
Argo's flake is the discontrol of the need to show too much action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very fun role as Hollywood partners, although their characteristics deserved more space and are not, not much less, the only in this movie.
For these reasons, Affleck's movie loses a little dramatic trace, but it is a movie that can be followed with a moderate interest, assessing its performance and the back style of a thriller that evolves in the 70s.
But if it breaks, it'll be hard.
As an evocation of a real history and as a proof of the exagerated that can be the ideas of all-presence and all the science of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflation of globs, bananas and circles
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year provides an investigation on the most absurd taxes, has now decided to announce the concurrence on "the more absurd rules or ideas of the EU's boarder".
"The EU has planned to approve a 40 percent of women in positions in large European companies," explained Pravo Patrik Nader, the enquêting organisationer.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to join insurance policies between men and women.
Even now, women were promoted by better prices in life insurance because they represented objectly a smaller risk.
"Every incredible ideas of the EU boarder can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nader informed.
Among the EU's controversed regulations, for example, is the obligatory to biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, damage the environment; another is the use of the mercury termometres of the whole life only because they contain a small quantity of a dangerous substance or the leadership exceeds the size of the bullets, which has contributed to a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factic ability to use the expression "mantequilla of untar" or the removement of the classic booming of trades has been criticized.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union’s equipment often takes such decisions under the pressure of one or other market or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with veto threat, repeat the requirements of its owns).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the higher quality platforms should have at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "anormal curvatures".
The European Commission was defensed by saying that this is only seeking to harmonize national standards not humanized until the date, which simply complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposite of some states, have been sustained on the basis of the existing Directive to have a disaster of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the investigation could be the EU's prescription of last year, where inflammable globes marketing are required to warn that children of less than 8 years are not authorised to violate them without the supervision of a adult.
The EU was referring to an American study, which, when players are talking about, is the main cause of infant death by asfixia.
A similar restriction applies to the use of matsugar by children of up to 14 years.
Curious events are born even in our country
It is also absurd that the regulation relates to European officers: any one who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name of ́a. To avoid hurt the sensitivity of Greece, it should be spoken of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia of 日a).
The Banko‐poplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economy-economy Laissez Faire, named in the investigation, among certain absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food provisions in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum amounts of food provisions that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our arrival to the EU.
Then the Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the volume set for seats in conserve, which suggested a substantial threat to a substantial punk.
The investigation organisations also interested in payment to those countries who do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subvention to the application of subventions.
This type of ideas came not in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're in disappointment for the fact that we don't have sea.
We requested the European Union a compensation," he stated in October 2004 the Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
It argued that in our country there was a lot of cereal and, as a result of the called intervention purchases, the state had full stocks and must be exported.
It is Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from the sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public concurrence for the purchase of cereals of countries that have no access to the sea.
The subvention to receive a subvention was proposed to the municipalities by the Minister for Local Development, addressed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), particularly for the editing of applications for subventions in Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are a pressure
The rights of the Member States are often white of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and also a more effective functioning and development in the whole Union deserve better, if several experts, our recognition.
The most serious problem is, for example, the covering of EU subventions for projects that have nothing to do with the depth of European integration, but that Member States have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czech also touches the sensitive fibre, as other countries of the Union, the fight for the right to the name of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious from these pounds.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, had successfully defended the name of origin of Olomo-Request, but had to change the name of the national round, whose tradition in our country was remonted to the 19th century, and was called "Tuzemak".
Only products produced from sugar can be called ron, but not those factors from sugar remolacha.
In the official list of protected names of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola kiss known worldwide, the German city Mazapan Lübeck or Parma's Jammon, for example, Karlovy Vary's galletes, Pohorélice's and Tréboň's carpets, and even the variety of bullets of Jatec.
As protected marines of the EU, they may be proud of the yengibre de Pardubice and the ships de Horíce in Podkrkonoší.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm an amazing, Okamura
Mr Senator, how did you present the elections for the President?
It's not to be Senator or President.
If it was good in our country, then I wouldn't present my candidature.
But I can't be able to see how it was stolen in our country in the last 20 years, how the lawyers remain imposed, the taxes and the age of jubilation are increased.
He had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I don't like, I'm trying to make a solution to change it.
And since I have 40 years and my candidature is independent, the only chance I have to change the things is to present me as senator or president.
The Senado has already arrived, but a little later it has been put on the road to the presidency.
Doesn't you give the shot to those who voted?
I always said that my candidate to the presidency depended on the results in the elections of the Senate.
Later I needed that if I had chosen Senator, I would present my candidate to the president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can do my own ideas.
Therefore, I need the most possible influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we foot on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is the means of communication, which disgusting you and confusing the freedom of expression with the freedom of lies.
I'm saying I've submitted to journalists what I've been advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
The President's fight with financial and criminal responsibility for politicians and the statement of property above twenty million are presented.
For that, the law must be changed.
As President, it does not have this competition and only the Senate in its total can provide laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been a part of a group of pressure so that the leader office would be recognised as an autonomous work, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in the policy: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether or whether or not from the left, it is intended and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain support for all Parliamentary groups.
Without encampments or game dogs, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and apply it.
Does a man of left or of left be considered better?
From the chec point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
It doesn't matter to me, it's a little left or a little ́s.
What I'm worried is that we're going out.
I don't care if someone's from left or left, I want to join people.
Always openly support any good solution, independent of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
It's crazy when you say you're popular.
But he doesn't prove it with what he says?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain objectives and ideals.
And you're getting close to them.
There will be people who laugh to him, but all the proposals I speak already work in the world or known experts are talking about them.
But without Parliament's support, it is only granted to him.
This is why it cannot survive in the long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will, for example, get a criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have another option.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and put them from my part to achieve it.
If the President had been chosen, there would be no problem to organize a direct television transmission in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary party to legitimate criminal and financial responsibility for political, officers, judges and taxors of the state.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong person that indicates the disputes, pressure can be made on the political scene.
We should take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I think I'm just an affectionate, I'm not a genius or a intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals, I'm trying to find aliens.
I have just started in the policy and I'm trying to get the most possible support for my programme.
I'm trying to take the things before me, but if it's not good, I'll leave it and return to the private sector within six years.
It sounds like Okamura would save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a salvator.
I know that I don't do anything with someone, so I have visited a series of known personalities, for if they are best encouraged to present their candidature to the sender.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who led the frauds with light calamity oil.
I've been presenting from the basis that people are really uncomfortable, now I'm in the balance.
The sixty per cent of the population did not come to the urns and those who did so voted to the representatives of the establishment.
We are two of the independent sector in the senate.
People chose the senate, so it will be complicated to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of alms or governments.
Are you thinking to form your own game?
I have not yet considered it because I don't have time for it, to check the intakable past of each of the potential members of the party, and I don't even have money.
I don't have money or for the campaign at the president, in my transparency account there are only 20,000 coroners.
Doesn't you have money?
Speaking about property statements, how is it yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague, I have an estimated territory in 25 million, a rated 10 million, another rate of eight million, a collection of art works with a value of 10 million, an Aston Martin of approximately 3,5 million and a Superb Schoda valuated in a million, and in the account I have a few million.
Of course, I have a Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who drived this car, was galant with women and, at the same time, fighted against wickedness and injustice.
Did you drive a Aston Martin, his property is valued in 60 million and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say he wants to change the Republic but he doesn't want to put too much money on your own.
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I have to cover?
I've already set 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that there is no patrocinator shows that there is not too much interest in my programme.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with money from my bottle.
The expenditure of the campaign covers essentially what I will receive in the concept of Senator's suit.
For example, I couldn't pay my son the English School, which costs 30,000 corones menes.
If I just want to win money, then I wouldn't be a candidate.
So you'll continue with your business activities to live?
Didn't you say before I was going to leave this activity?
This doesn't have anything to do with a bigger swimming.
As I promised, in part I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my subscription in primavery.
People want to be the Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I also need to live for something.
How common is it to win monthly as a businessman?
Among 200,000 to 400,000, I'm still winning.
If he was the President, then I would leave business.
You can consult all the interviews on the Sabbath of Prava.
The MVRDV architecture study shows that the real aventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "bodies" - 2 photos
"I think the building is funny, it has a future aspect, and finally there's something interesting to see," -- Lisette Verhaig, a transaction that passes through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, TI technology in a large company near the library, points: "Adam, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
Nobody's going in the past mode libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a room city at the doors of Roterdam, which only deserves a refuge visit, shows the doubtful honour that he has raised up with a record for victory.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the lowest alphabetisation rate in the Netherlands.
To cope with this so confused situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and to copy the seven poor fictions represented in the euro billets in the form of decorated armed hormone miniatures.
The success of educational offence was limited.
And this was how the political responsibles decided that there was only a possibility to improve statistics: I had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Netherlands architecture study MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of the bars diagrams and responsible for the divertised buildings to the kinesic couple, took the subject with its habitual serenity and compared to the presentation of the concurrence in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face.
And while the jury looked perplexely around her and covered her spots, Maas went to pillar the books by size by forming a piramide and concluded his short talk with the following words:
Here you have it, my proposal for Spijkenisse's mountain books, named 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has risen at the planned place.
This is a part of the revitalisation project, which is completed with a subterranean parking, a supermarket, a mail office and a couple of buildings of residents and households.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books was galardonated with the second premium "Best Library of NL 2012".
Furthermore, the project is also appointed to "Du日 National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small white city of history, which until the date had no more than offering that a postmodern peatonal area and an incredible join after which a white fashion would more intuirate a milk central, now with a modern architecture work.
But especially, Spijkenisse now has the first public public building of his history.
The long path to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a quesera.
It is true that there is a ascensor that brings us right to the center of this mountainly basket, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but they prefer to shape with their topgraph at each step of their scale upward.
The completely acrystalated internal results easily and easily shiping with the view, the recovered ladry ground and the elegant fabrics support the public with the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When the view stands, the park, dogs, children and girls can be displayed playing football.
And on every side books, books and more books.
"Normal book stationers are available in the middle of the fashion and in the centre is opened a huge dark room that generally seems to be something uncomfortable and impersonal," -- Winy Maas.
What we have done is putting the classic space settings up to and getting the inner reading area outside.
The inside of the mountain is very useful: the offices, the Internet library, the age club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the medium.
Specific mention deserves black stoneries that take the wall revestiture, parapete and bardilla functions at the same time.
The view, the tact, and the olfate are strange.
Even the architects and civil engineers most daily go up the head when they hear talking about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And it is like one day, in a frigorous agricultural explosion, we are focused on the appropriate subproduct from the agricultural.
Since many years ago, inver ́ros and in the Netherlands fields a plastic weight of small miles of speed is used as a basis for submitting the roots of the culture.
It's a nice and nice material.
This finger tissue has two stations and then leaves.
For the library, this tissue was first printed in such quantities until it reached four centimeter sprays.
With heat and pressure, the named agricultural plastic (KLP) changes in color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that flees to a new car mixture and a sport mixture.
After 105 bullets come to the top of the mountain.
At the end of this road, we have nearly 500 meters around the mountain: from the cafeteria you have not only a fantastic view of the city, but it also can enjoy sabrous netherlands croquets and its figs planted in large macetes.
These create a pleasant environment for the couple that maintains the appropriate atmosphere humidity for this mountain.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it costs to believe it given to its large acrystalated surfaces, this building is an exemplary project regarding theology," says Trouborst.
Calamity and refrigeration are obtained from geothermic energy.
Although the mountain of books is stuck under a huge cristal piramide, even in the most soled days the sun sole is inside it for a few hours.
The huge wood wood cycles transversal to the cristal fabs serve to shade and absorb the majority of the sun rays.
This creates a comfortable internal climate.
The rest is something of the automatic persians.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptic worker of the Information Technology Sector, has already been attracted to put the foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Similarly, the Chinese traditional medical teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, due to the inelucration that happened a few weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book of their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill the optical spaces of a library that still doesn't count with its full file; now it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has lost hot.
The stations are filled.
"There is nothing worse than a medium library," the Winy Maas architect.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative, all inhabitants now have a certain relationship with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Although it's just to be worshipped.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved success in that discipline that in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the story of the lay.
Independently from the young man and inculcate that he can be.
Finally, a game point to comply with its identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany has been retained in the vote on the admission of Palestinian.
It is Stephen Szabo, expert in the United States-Europe relations, which is situated in Berlin in a very diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At weekly beginning, Germany understood that he would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories with the United Nations observer State.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that one to the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I think it doesn't also support northern American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence without being too critical with Israel.
The rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstracted when it was to establish a flight area.
This has finally been declared by the OTAN.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are in game?
Yeah, that's it.
This should be that it is currently reorienting its external policy, avoiding a leading policy, so that it is, by the United States and focused on a German foreign policy.
And more difficult things are that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are located in a crossed.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to do so.
I think they're still scaring what will be your role, but they've already started the way to a "normal" external policy.
A external policy similar to the countries such as France or Great Britain.
What specifically means a "normal" external policy from the German viewpoint?
It is a policy that, in the case of national interests, is available to defend different positions than the United States or their European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is a strong motivation in the economic policy, which is, in exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and Next East.
German economic interests are too different from other major powers, and therefore Germany must protect their interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position adopted in respect of the conflict in the Near East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany accounts with large markets in the Nearest East, especially in the Golf.
For this reason, it must be careful and not depend on the Arabic public opinion, nor on the arabic elections.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give you so much importance because it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany affected its relationship with the U.S. by refusing to vote in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?
I think in Europe, even in the United States, the German position enjoys a great degree of understanding.
For this reason, I don't think there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has succeeded to make a certain respect.
Finally, all this has done but proved that it is a country to which they are seriously taking into account as a international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the United States has been clearly shown for a veto.
Is there a difference in opinions between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed because of the internal and internal policy.
I think the government of Obama shows a great understanding in secret to the European position.
However, because of the political situation that lives here, it is obvious that the government cannot openly defend that position.
I think the real difference of opinions has not actually the envergetment that it is assigned to him.
If we analyze the relationships between Obama and the Prime Minister of Israel Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not anxious with the development policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to conciliate the east relations he maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think that is exactly what makes it become so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germans if there was a coherent and homogene European policy, but it is not the case.
Therefore, they have no possibility to be part of a higher entity, but they must impulse the things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leadership role at the time of committing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is nothing easier for Germany, but it is simply for the relationship he maintains with Israel.
This has always been a fighting topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figures.
Is Germany seen himself in the role of important international actor? Does Germany really want to take a protagonist role?
Or maybe it's still difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been used, it always results in something uncomfortable and, for evident reasons, it costs the country to play a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is positioned as a major actor, some anti-German feelings are discouraged.
This is not easy for Germans.
It's an old problem, and it's that no one wants to be surrounded from the hostile countries.
Because of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
Show a recipient in front of the different neighbors and opinions, which is not easy.
The U.S. influenza in the European Policy decreases more, but the EU does not cover this empty, who remains then?
The Germans will have no more medicine than to take a more protagonist role.
Even if they don't like them, if it's unpleasant or if you're converting them into a still more immature people, it's life!

"Protection of Marks" in China: when Puma and Armani are immediately converted into Chinese marks
Armani is a globally known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what's Armani Polo?
After this name, a officially registered name is hidden in China but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this joy of protection while the true eponics do not present a request.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them the reason.
"For foreigners is more difficult to protect their marks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the Taylor Wessing Buffet specialised in violations of protection rights in Extrem East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The imitators simply add a few letters to be able to register their marks.
In this way, Guă becomes Lu-Gu and instead of Prada is registered by Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as it has happened to the manufacturer of Puma sports articles.
Pattloch opens a vector in which keeps sitting in the Pekín mark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the Zegna DF Puma mark, a artificial name that also served from the Hermenegildo Zegna Mode House.
The Chinese are worldwide campaigns to copy and violate intellectual property rights is known.
In the large towns there are large stocks of several plants dedicated to sale of employment.
However, Pattloch's cases are otherwise. Because of its customers, he fights against the fact that the mark office is officially conceived to Chinese companies the right to take profit of a name already registered in another place.
China's name is "Bang Ming Pai" or a coming mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
that refers to women who have "fished" to a rich man.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty
"It's dangerous for business, it's to fight against it," requests Pattloch.
"The mark makes water, the monopolist position disappears, and the damage that suffers the image is great."
Financial losses and processal costs of the sectors concerned are millionary, especially in the case of emblemical products.
Data from the CLSSA market analysis undertaking are given, with a volume of EUR 15,000 million per year, China is the third market of luxe articles and grows in greater time.
However, the cancellation of duplicate legality records in the marks record is complicated and there is also a lot of money.
Processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court deceived a request because it had passed so long that the name of the request had already become a "marketing reality".
"If the applicant has bad happiness, maybe he may even have to pay money to the plagier because the process has damaged this mark in China," says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the wild.
Some of the most known cases have to be viewed with graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the manufacturer of Sany building materia, the company which has been absorbed a short time ago by the German manufacturer of hot-bombs Putzmeister.
Therefore, today Chinese can continue using a very similar emblem as the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, first used a white logo and at ́a ́ that remembered in great measure to BMW; the matter was addressed to the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against Hong Kong and Singapore imitators whose logo represented a cocodril looking at the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty.
The CTMO mark office in Pekín recognises that in 2010 they have had difficulties because of the lack of equipment and personal dotation.
The last year, however, "the situation of work emergency returned to normality."
In this way, the number of non-traditional reclamation processes has been reduced to 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were solved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81.500 claims remain in resolution.
Trust against this costs much money
As it seems to be usual in China, the numbers are strange.
In the past year, the CTMO registered more than 1,4 million mark protection applications, almost one third of them in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China would lead the list of new records throughout the world for tenth year, indicated the mark office.
It seems that this is also happening with the number of valid logos, a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.800 million yuanians would have been refunded in the concept of rights.
Otherwise, this means that each inscription cost ≥80 yuan or EUR 160.
Trust against this costs much money, as it shows the case of the German family company's joynberg.
For more than seven years ago, the group fights in courts against a Chinese imitator.
While Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of pars of imitation cars,
the imitator has succeeded to ensure Chinese rights on the gladnberg mark.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because the calls are not protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, President and Advisory Delegated of Lucnberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO mark office also deceived the resource of the municipalities.
In the following two instances, the reason for joynberg has been given, but the opposite part is still fighting at present.
Must be very careful
The case has now reached the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where it remains a resolution.
Wentzler trusts that he can resolve the issue and praise the professionality of the courts.
However, it is also that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the business file has to review expeditions from up to hundred years of anti-equipment to be able to provide tests.
Five years ago, gladnberg offered the opposite part a "some of six digits in euros" to reach a friendly agreement, but he did not succeed.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler said.
The dangers in the Extreme East are threatened even to affect Europe,
specifically if the imitators are there to ensure the rights on not protected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg for hair and skin products in Germany.
Since ago, the group abandoned this trade area, however, it had been able to prevent the registration.
"I have to be very careful," -- Wentzler.
As well as the lawyer Pattloch recommends German companies who are extremely decent at the time of business with China.
It is not enough to trust international market rights legislation, but what is needed to do is "register also in China all that can be able to be protectable", as Wentzler points.
In contrast, the subject can result much more deeply than a simple record.
In fact, if gladnberg had lost the last attack of his particular battle, then it would have to pay the contrary party license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the area concerned would have expelled us from the market.
World Day of War against AIDS: Dancing, song, help
Heidelberg tests Imbongi coron and Swaziland rejoices the AIDS orphans
The story of a link is able to overcome much more than 8.733 km distance.
First, it begins by dance: cowboy boats, balloons, tacons and mucasines are looking for compassion on the parquet ground, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then, the voices of the songs begin to be slowly raised (in contrast, lower, tender and superno), arremolinse, enthusiasm and follow each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes almost by putting order with its energy and mild gestures.
It's Monday at the afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute, the coro Imbongi tests a new song.
The fifty songs, from between 23 and 69 years, have also come from human genetist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not a easily piece, each crown's voice has a different text and also in a known foreign language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for AutoHelp
UNIDAD estimates, the United Nations programme for AIDS combating, there are around the world approximately 34 million people infected by HIV virus.
23,5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245.000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already sero.
The Voices for Africa association has found padrinos in Germany for the 180 AIDS AIDS.
Seventy of them attend the secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, a child can be paid.
This award will cover the school matrix, the uniform and will guarantee you a warm food daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means the "sue of stories" or "panegirist".
In this room, nobody knows to speak fluidly this bathu language, but sing you know.
Since ten years ago, this coro tested songs in this sweet foreign language that sometimes can transport them to their origin: South Africa.
At 8.733 miles of remote online from Heidelberg, north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a people called Esitenti that depends on the voices of this German coronary.
40 percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple barry and cups, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 parents have no more because they have sucked the AIDS.
Esitzien is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lower life hopes worldwide, is Unicef.
The population does not see the circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of counterfeit.
More than 40 per cent of the population in Swaziland are leaders of the immune deficiency virus, and death has become something normal.
A joint journey to Africa in the early 2005, the crown discovered this remarkable population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets that had not only the protection of their parents, but mainly: food, clothing and training.
Without school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more than escape.
In a principle, it was only the particular commitment of a few things that would make a child to be a college and enjoy a warm food daily, all of this for a few euros.
However, one year after the coroe founded the "Voices for Africa" association who has since then been professionally occupied with the AIDS orphans in Estoni.
Acts on sexual transmission infections
What are the main sexual transmission diseases?
Among the ETS of origin are sifilis, clamidia and gonorrea.
The most usual virus ETS are AIDS, human papiloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sarnas are located between the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected people?
Siphilis and gonorree are more frequently given in men who maintain sexual relations with others.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four of each five cases of sifilis registered in Germany have its origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, most common sexual transmission diseases are clamidia, tricomona infections, human papiloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrea.
The counterpart of HIV between hetherosexual adults in the country is low; however, approximately 20% of the new HIV infections are registered in this group.
among youths, clamidia infections are much more usual than in other population groups.
Europe's investigations, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
In our country, human papiloma virus is also added to the most usual diseases between youth.
How has the number of infections been developed?
Not all sexual transmission diseases are subject to obligatory declaration.
The Robert Koch Institute, the number of sifilis infections has doubled its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has maintained a descending trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2.700 cases were registered.
It is a tenth part less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venerous disease?
Infectional diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, molesty in orrinary, fluid, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or wounds.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore do not be detected.
How can a protector be protected?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of counterfeit, but they do not offer protection to hundred per cent.
Some patogens of sexual transmission diseases may also be transmitted to ≥ suicide and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regularly submit to medical examinations, especially if sexual couples are frequently changed.
If they are temporarily, the majority of the ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any later consequences.
Age of cooperation, donations, and, finally, but not less important, of the honoraries who cover the core for their actions in all Germany, come to recovery a lot of money.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitenti," states the proud Annette Lennartz, President of the association.
In its own people Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman of himself and with leadership docs managed the money sent from Germany.
It is concerned that orphans find a good apartment, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "gogos", as called the older women in Zulu, are the pilares of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans at their charge, offer them a tissue where they live and take care of that children come to school every day pointly and dressed with their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, as well as the two kitchens who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hambrient children, receives a salary of the association.
Furthermore, "Voices of Africa" has running a coast school, built two galliners and, in collaboration with the healthy and PSI organization, has achieved that many of the people have been subject to a HIV test.
This is not something obvious, because, despite the patent that is this disease throughout the country, it does not seem to be openly talked about it.
A King with 14 Women
"The AIDS is an absolute tabu," 日 Annette Lennartz, "for he needs to see sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known by its opulent and full of life.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of not officially accepted life is largely responsible for so quick propagation that has experienced HIV virus in the last decades.
But it is also to the unnumberable timers that run the country from one side to another and which bring it there where they go.
It is Annette Lennartz, "in any case it is possible to get free reserves, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here they only accept the skin contact against skin."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the coro Imbongi travels every two or three years through South Africa, sanging songs that speak of melancolia, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in black race, songs that many in the southern extreme of the African continent still resort from the time of the apartheid.
A white bus playing songs in a black language; so recognition brings it not only a good environment and a great joy, but it has also been able to drag a few lips to someone other soldier fronter’ rabbious.
The journey always leads them to Esitzien, where the songs visit the awarded children.
Although this small population appears only in the maps, in the river E日veni valley is very known.
"Access to Esitanti, there is light," the people of the place.
And after running the 8.733 miles on line to Heidelberg to the street trial rooms of Bergheimer played with songs marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercurio
The Messenger song has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Test the ice layer has a speed of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has made evidence of the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Despite being treated with the nearest planet in the sun, there is also iron water, as it is discovered from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger's song would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently at the shadow a ice layer has been made.
It seems that this has at least 30 centimeters and probably even 20 meters of speed.
The water is probably out of comets or, with great probability, of asteroids who chockered against Mercurio on his day.
No one relates the ice finding with the possibility of life on the planet, the head investigator of the Messenger Sonda, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercurio can reach up to 426 degrees centimeters.
However, findings could help to explain how water and other components of life have reached to other areas of the sun system.
In a completely advertised manner for the inhabitants of the Earth Planet, suns, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploit the depths of the universe.
From time they send images to Earth: small windows to the size of the space.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that comply with our solar system, besides the eye planet Ceres.
Like Pluton, who turns around the right sun behind Neptuno, the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is not a "planet".
This section of an infraroad image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "Family retraite" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as points to the points, although the most difficult to recognize is the rose color of the "born" stars.
This area of training of stars, called a little romantic way by scientists W5, was devered by the Spitzer telescope in the Casiopea constellation, at a distance of 6.500 years light.
This returned image of an extinction star was taken by the NASA's Telescope Spitzer.
The ring in the form of donut is composed of the material that the star split in its extinction process.
In the vast Nebulosa Trifida, at 5.400 years of light on Earth, new stars are formed from gas and powder.
The NASA's telescope Spitzer took this photo from the galaxy star training area.
The Pléyades, a group of stars also known with the "The Seven Sisters", are a simple object in the night sky.
However, with the telescope, colors can be made better.
The Nebulosa of the Hélice appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrarroads.
It is found at 700 years of light of the Acuario constellation.

The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Nebulosa Trifida at several thousands of years of light in the Sagitary constellation.
The name Trifida comes from the latin term "trifidus" (divided in three), since some dark powder lines divide the heart of this staring area in three lobbles.
In the Office's constellation, the astronomes could photograph the indications of a cosmic character: 400 million years of light on the Earth the two galaxies in the fussion process are equipped to one another to end choking unremediably.
This sharing of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spirit galaxie.
Those who don't like technical abbreviation can refer to it with the overname of Australia Molinillo.

Scientists call up the higher UGC 1810 spiral galaxie.
The group of youngest stars in our Milk Road is located in this lowly.
This star training area produces constantly new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rose Nebulosa, there are also still new stars; 5000 years light from the Earth.
In this so much galaxie with a small black egg yet there is no powder, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after big bang, when you could be found in the universe above all.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 before Galileo Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the speeds of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images that offer us have more deepness.
Early 30 years, particularly from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope held in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the biggest of the world.
His speed, on the picture, had a five-meter diameter.
The Binocular Telescope is raised in Arına, United States.
This allows you to observe the cosmos at ≥ two speeds, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner of the Grand Telescope Canarias in the island of La Palma is large - only the speed has a diameter of 10,4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope speed in South Africa is segmented to cover costs.
Despite that, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 metres.
The inconvenient of this most economic building is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
His particularity is its great ability to collect light.
Despite counting a comparatively smaller speed diameter, that capacity is equipped with the largest speed telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search for external life signals.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI for its English Sections) you can help anyone who has a computer by providing processing capacity.
View of the European Observatory of Australia (ESO) held in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four speeds, this telescope can also isolate the average infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also accompany the name E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Telescope Extremly Great).
His primary speed will be shiped 42 metres and will be composed of a total of 1.000 reflecting elements.
Until 2018, it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
By 2007, the two Keck's telescopes in the Hawaiian Vulcan of Mauna Kea were considered the biggest worldwide.
These are counted with two spices, each of them with a 10 meters diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which with them explodes the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRT.
Mauna Kea is intended to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a 30-metres spray diameter.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, she sent pictures of worlds remotely.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler looks for extra-solar planets, especially those who are residents.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that from the beginning of its mission →35 candidates to planets had been located.
In the picture, the latest preparation for the Kepler space telescope is seen.
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched at the border space of Ariane 5 to 2018.
The primary speed of this space telescope has a diameter of 6,5 metres.
One of the functions of this telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers are part of the basis that there is also ice in the south pool of Mercurio.
However, there are no fashionable evidences, since the Sound Messenger turns back to the planet in a much closer orbit northern.
From a decade, radar measurements point to the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Thanks to the Messenger Sonda (2004), the first orbiting back to Mercurio, the scientists now have the sure that it is.
Drink a day and live 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are able to reach Bible age.
There is even a museum dedicated to long-term.
A trace of oil in a country where 97-year-old people are still considered young.

A trace of oil in a country where 97-year-old people are still considered young.
The resort by the mountain region of Talysh could be qualified of salvage and romantic.
The minibus goes ahead with a great stretch to 日 of the sinusous road that passes by the side of boss mountains, rivers of big chadal and of the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and jewelous, one could even think it's located in the Black sauce.
However, we are in the southern area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers.
Here are the "talyshi", a people of which is not much known, except that they are perfectly dominating the Persian and the Azer, and they are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city assumes a architecture may be too macisy designed in the Soviet age and that doesn't seem to be involved in a so pintorical mountain landscape.
European tourists only come to this place, since the way from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To run the 323 kilometers that separate both urban nuclears, eight hours are needed because the road is from one sense.
The amazing richness of which the country enjoys thanks to the Caspio oil has not yet reached this remarkable region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what he needs to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku has been able to celebrate the Eurovision Festival in May, and the next year we will celebrate the Festival of the elderly people in the world," said Fatulayeva.
It's the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight thousand talyshis of the place that has over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva indicates a black and black image.
This is my grandmother, who lived 120 years old.
His son died at the age of 136 years
However, the inconceivable star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Shirali Müslumov, which seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth game that certifies it.
And if we notice that the older age man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müsluimov is very suspicious.
"Nation in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. It seems that he still had time to build a daughter more than 136 years old.
Did Sherali Müsluimov then wrong in his age in a couple of deities?
However, Brandt Scholz, gerontolog at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan, or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan, also live a very advanced age people," --Scholz, "There are many older men in Cerdeña."
Because of the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence on age; maximum if there is no civil registry.
Every day wheat filled with cracked bottle
It is a fact that, often frequently, the people of the region returned to Lerik are planning to reach a Bible age.
There are now 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
Why do you live here, in the south, so many advanced age people?
The azerian tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of Museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause resides in food.
However, from a nutritional view, it does not seem logical that exactly the rich food in the calories of the talyshis, which worship meat, bread and above all milk products, and many of whom they drink every day a divorced mantequil vessel, is so healthy.
Or maybe the nature of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small apartment from the city of Lerik lives Ruba Mirzayeva.
At its 97 years, it is young for what it is stipulated by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who has 143 seeds, lives in a simple house of typical wood in the entire region of Caucaso.
Sit on the ground, moving incansablely a huge cup of cup.
Eight people live under a thick, among them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents ago.
They also spring from one side to two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare the tee for the guests, a tea that serves in some typical vessels in a furious form.
The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and under the pawn hide two long dark hair hair trees that your son discovers us proud.
I've always laid my hair with milk, so it's never fallen to me, and he's keeping his color.
"I never used a champu," Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what was produced in his own landscape: tomates, patates and guisers.
I've never gone to buy a supermarket.
Then she's talking about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the time after the Second World War.
However, everything returned to his cup when the "loyal father", Heydar Aliyew, took the control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the worship that is dedicated to the parental figure of the nation, which leads his country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This remained in power until 2003, at the time the testimony sent to his son Ilham.
At least the older people in Azerbaijan don't know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva cooks 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as pension concept, a quantity with which it can be lived well taking into account the situation here.
And maybe the cansy son of Mirzayeva has the right: "In our culture the biggest are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all their care and are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to keep it alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Music Rights"
The revolution has come back to Cairo.
Manufactures that raise each other in the Cairo show the terrible division in which the country is summarized.
The future constitution, with sharia as a base, is very controversy.
The Egyptian President did not escape the patetism.
"We have to overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in public television.
His speech was directed to all the people, especially to the Christians, the Liberals, the Muslims, and the centuries.
All of them, without remedy to now in a confused opposite, have fear.
Meeting a theocracy at the rivers of the Nile for the grace of the powerful muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he had to temporarily cancel the competences of the Constitutional Court and expand its "to save the revolution".
However, not the Egyptians or the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate title authorized by the South California University really wants to save.
Does it mean to privacy your power to the judgement?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been formed by a constitutional assembly composed of 100 members mainly islamists in a night of 15 hours, are truly concerned.
As in the previous constitutions, the borrower also states that the legality is based on the "principes of the Islamic Right".
But what does that mean of "principes"?
This was and still open to the interpretation, and it seems that the islamists will use this vaga formulation, as well as the legal maniobra margin that leads to appear, to introduce a stricter interpretation of the sherry.
This is at least what is suggesting a new article added: In all issues relating to the sharia, it is obligatory to consult the University of Al-Ashar, the most important islamic institution of the country with great power in all the Islamic Suni.
It doesn't have to be so, but this may mean that the church would control the legislation, something that, in fact, would result in the incapacity of judgement.
A large part of the constitution's burst is open to the interpretation
What also results difficult is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
The Dictator of Mubarak these courts served to exercise a strong repression on opposition.
After the dictator's fall to 11.000 civilians were arrested in military offences.
As stated by the blanking, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its moral and values".
It is so impressive in legal terms that State institutions could even control the contents of cinematographic and cinema.
Clearly, it's not something else than censure.
Of course, no article provides explicitly the equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibited offending or calamniating the Prophet Mohammed and its associates.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it must be sanctified.
Similarly, it is the formulation that prohibits the "officiality to people"
Is it enough for the president's loading or a chist on a letter?
The question of interpretation, as many other things in the whirlwind that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, its words, "very quickly" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to referencendum.
"The revolution has gone back."
Weeks ago, the opposite has closed rows before the superiority of the islamists.
Ten thousand people were gathered in an inu harmonia on Friday after Friday at the Tahrir Place of Carius and swore to make the Act failure before they could enter into force.
"The revolution has come back and we will end winning," -- Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies the third place in the lists of presidential elections.
The Nobel of the Peace and Ex-director of the International Atomic Energy Organization, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the constitutional remotor should be "in the cube of the story's basure".
The Twitter accused Mursi's followers that he wanted to lead a "state fight against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum we'll go to his palace and throw it out," or Jasser Said.
"We are not still disappointed, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated," it was quoted in the Egyptian media to the politician or Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the reference, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Coran is our constitution"
In its part, the well-organised Muslim community called to celebrate a contra-manufacturing; for if true, not at the Tahrir Place, but after a prayer at the other side of the Nilo, before the University of El Cairo.
Many women who had a vial and shareholder of the salafists participated in itself in saying: "The people require the application of the divine law."
They requested Mursi to clean the country, at the same time they proclaimed: "The Coran is our constitution."
A battle for the sovereignty of the Simbiotic Place Tahrir, where they eat everything, would have caused a situation similar to one of a civil war.
It is obvious that Mursi's partyers didn't want to risk that something like this happens.
The Muslim brothers have said that both those who are opposed to the removing of the constitution and the parties of the same would have expressed their high and clear opinions.
Now it would have been the time to let the people decide in the urns what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the islamist breather has guaranteed most of them.
"The expression 'Music Rights' doesn't appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have dured until February and have included all social forces.
This 48-year lawyer specialised in human rights and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a judgment during Mubarak dictature.
Not because he would have his ideology, but because for him human rights are indigenous.
For this reason, he was struck, condemned and in prison.
"And now the expression `His Rights' doesn't appear in the new constitution," it is lamented in a conversation with the "Welt am Sonntag".
The enlargement of Mursi's competence to the three powers of the State has made this lawyer resignation.
The measures adopted are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will bring to Egypt a new dictature.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, what the President has done is to abolite it," Saeda is deceived.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological fight that is going on at the river of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and stress.
This could come back to your opposite.
A manifester at Tahrir place warns, "You are designing a monster that you can't control."
The Norwegian rakfish: Is the most malicious fishermen in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the largest levels of life, not only of Europe but of the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country keeps any relationship with its beauty for a very malicious fisherman?
Take a series of carefully cured.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of sucking and humid football clothing.
Leave it a week.
Then you can see the paralyzant aroma of the rakfisk, one of the Norwegian exquisites.
I'm in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours in Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that hole, always present, float in the air.
The rakfisk is thrown in salmon that leaves to be fermentated in water for a while, depending on the evil-liant that you prefer, until a year.
As it dark and do more cold, the Norwegians come in tropeal to a festival that is celebrated here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food more than so, so, captive.
"It's eating cruel and then drinking a aquavit vessel of a tragedy," says Havard Halvarsen, a bomber of the city that is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
We all see people eat this fishing that is keeping in small cubes and drinking of an important amount of drink.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfish," --Havard.
The drink can kill the hole.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a part of sushi that has cut a few kilometers in bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which the poverty was azota Norwegian and in which, before the refrigeration, the fishing was stored during the water-summerged hole and salted in hermetic barriers.
Later, in full winter, when it is already well fermented, it gets out and, obviously, with inactive senses due to alcohol, it eats.
There is just one generation, thousands of Norwegians have seen committed to abandon their country in the search of work, and have migrated mainly to the United States.
The population is currently increasing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high salaries and a full social service system.
A stream of residents in Sweden, the old rival and even makes not too richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfish is considered something important, a substantial part, although very malicious, of the past of Norway.
It is located between the lowest plates that can be purchased.
But, in fact, it's all sweet. A beer dog or a sandwich cost you the 10€ (14 dollars) everyone.
Norway does not like to appear in the agenda of the international news and most Norwegians like that.
Here people are still a little ready to proclaim the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme racist, who crippled to trains and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the Tyrotheus as "the event of July 22".
Norwegians are very interested in thinking that in their passive country one of them was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After many of the current riches of Norway, growth is found since the beginning of the 70s of one of the largest oil and gas industrys in the world.
"But the petroleum is not the only reason for which we are so well," -- our companion, while it's going through cracks of rakfish and that, with his long melean rubies and his surprising eyes to the Norwegian welfare, represents the picture of the Norwegian welfare.
"We're, as you said, people do."
His English, like the majority of people in this country, is impecable.
"We don't like breathing, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil riches with much care; all, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested into a special fund for the future generations.
While all of the world was losing money that he had not had during the years that predicted the financial crisis throughout the world, Norway kept the well closed billet.
"When we can swim in winter and make senderism in soil, we are happy," he says.
"And eat rakfisk," adds with a cargoed design.
I'm in the snow doing school to eat something; I've had enough rakfish.
Now a alce hamburger is uncertainly something different and quite suculent to sabor.
But for the night, it's back that bad fishing.
The hotel in which I stumble is one of the many locals in which a rackfisk dinner is celebrated in which the commissals vote the best fishing, or maybe what most tests the nails.
A television has directly connected to a presentation that carries a pajarita and is surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It seems to be the Eurovision concurrence.
"What are your points for the best fishing there up in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"This is our score, Havard."
There are laughs and applauses.
A man falls from the seal, maybe winned by the aquavit.
Or maybe they're the vapors of all that fishing.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Neto is at a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is prepared to take a position of its charge, the responsibility of the BBC, Will Grant, analyses the challenges to which the new president and the different expectations of its population will be made.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad at present.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congestioned, has been installed a rail circle from Monday that shorts several of the main roads that lead to the city and causes a huge chaos in the streets.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to avoid that demonstrators could reach Parliament.
The Sabbath, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and adopt the management of the nation.
It was a complicated task.
Mexico has gone to gain good economic results during the outcome government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is insured in a war against drugs that has been covered for about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained at the beginning of this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Space.
"I'll propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before being encountered with the President of the United States, the previous political experience of Mr. Peña was as the Governor of his birth state, the Mexico.
A very popular state and with a quick growth, which surrounds the capital; the opinions of the new leader are divided into this territory where he would be moved.
A Honest Man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is rehearted with love.
Their residents deserve the growth of tourism in the place and in the infrastructure building.
To reach the city, one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto can be driven, which provides a huge improvement compared to the landed roads and full of bathrooms that were rehabilitated.
You can also see maps with your name in the introduction of a modern polyport and an impressionant interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and sustainable change," says his friend Gabriel Olvera Hernández, member of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the Price.
"Particularly, as regards security and economic, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in the power, the Price was deleted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years out of the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations about Enrique Peña Nieto within the party.
It also rejects the assessment that the opposite has lacked the importance of the new President.
"He is a very sincere, very committed man and with a fine vision of the country.
He's a great man of state and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other hand of the state, that is not the impression that many people have on their former ruler.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the gates of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
In many senses, it is a suburb of the Mexico City.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to help combat drug bands operating in bars and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a wilderness park, along with a bastard, the bodies of thousands of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1.000 women were killed in Mexico state while Mr. Peña Nieto was the ruler, a much higher rate than the city of Juárez, despite its violence and a place that is synonymous of murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, in the best of the cases, that I was not able to face the problem of feminicide while he was in charge.
The most critical accuses your administration to make the gorgeous view.
In a hormigon house, typical of the deteriorated barrio, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the lambs while she shows me photographs of her deceived daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version of the facts is, Mariana suicided in 2010.
Yet, his family believes that her husband killed her.
"When I came to her home, she seemed like they would have made her body," recalls Mrs. Boendia.
"I had signs that it had been struck and the death rigor had already appeared."
While her mother reports the story, a graph of Mariana observes from the walls, at a cross where one word is read: Justice.
Yet, that's exactly what the family says he has been rejected.
"State authorities have treated me as if it were an old chismous, an arborotic, a cheese.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that it is quiet."
"But that can't be so when so many irregularities and so neglects have been done."
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive the Sabbath will be accompanied by a great responsibility.
Decades of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the last six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during its mandate.
"I hope it's the same type of president that was when he was governing," said the Deputy of the Price Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what families of Neza's victims are more afraid.
Bradley Manning has not charged bad treaties, taxes are
Taxers are trying to face Bradley Manning's offences during their prison station
The judgment is focused on the Manning period in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia
Defense wants to disappoint the case based on Manning's arrest
The soldier of the army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The fiscals tried to demonstrate the Friday that Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest confidential information filtering in the history of the United States, lost several opportunities to declare the bad treaties that he now claimed that he suffered while he was under military arrest.
The question that the fiscality performed to Manning in a preview of the judgment in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Commander Ashden Fein, suggested that the registrations of weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received for nine months of arrest in Quantico, Virginia, show no claim on the treatment he received.
The questionnaire, which was carried out during a view made by the defense request to disappoint the case because its prison was hard and that it had already assumed enough punishment, came on a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of self-sustaining while he was arrested.
The army intellectual analysis, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while he was in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning is the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein revised with Manning the forms that the officers filled after visits to Manning during their arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where he was in prison in a maximum claim regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have made questions to Manning and noted their answers.
When Wednesday Fein asked about the formulaes, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment of the cells to him as "excellent" and the treatment received in the installations in general as "very professional".
The formulaes show no claim of bad treatments, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Maning replied that he had expressed his concern on some issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of these problems and had indicated that they would be treated, but that they did not leave those issues in the register.
"They were written "uncleannesses" (after having spoken of the problems) but this doesn't mean necessary that I had not mentioned any problem," said Manning.
The Court of Justice, Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not declared the treatment he received during the period of January 2011 with a advice to examine the plans of self-sufficiency that he had expressed in a form of months ago.
Maning replied that his intention during that period was to obtain the reduction of the "prevention of lesions" regime under which it was found.
The soldiers said that they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is a degree under the possibility of self-sufficiency, to ensure their protection and security of others.
"I wanted the greatest state to know that I was well and (will) stop being under prevention of lessions... to be able to enjoy what, from my view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning witnessed the Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to the military prison based on the Marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered selfish in Kuwait and that in one occasion he lost knowledge due to warmth.
He said that the fact that you would not be allowed to know what was happening to you or what happened in the outer world was very anxious.
"My world was just reduced to the Arafjon camp, to that cup," said Manning on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cup."
Maning suggested that, once after Quantico, most days passed in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Maning said that just you were allowed to have a cup, a knife, some cups, something of clothes and her knifes.
He explained that he was moved all the time, because he was able to sleep or even throwing down during the day.
Manning warned that he always had a light outside pointing to his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the cells couldn't see his face when it was turning the night, they would wake him to turn back.
In January 2011, the lawyer of Manning presented a formal claim on the treatment that Manning received.
Manning was after the military prison of Fort Leaven in Kansas in April 2011.
On Wednesday the judge asked Manning about an appeal that had made in the June declaration, which, after having been committed a night to sleep down in its Quantico cell, was obliged to stay in the front of the cells and other prisoners during a morning account.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover his hand during the record.
The question of the judge on Thursday, Manning said that he deducted by the order that he gave him the celador to leave the mantle with which he could have fallen, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to leave her falling.
Manning witnessed the Thursday that he had committed him to sleep late night because of an attempt to show a officer that he had no danger for himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his inner clothes or his cancles to self-lease but he hadn't done it.
Manning witnessed that that night they had removed their inner clothes, their clothes and their wheels from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge may take account of at least the experiences of which he has been in prison during and drasticly reduces his sentence in the case of conviction in the war advice, which is intended to begin at the beginning of the next year.
Defense noted that it was intended to make Manning declaration of minor crimes and to defend other accusations considered too extremely.
The view is expected to be renewed this weekend and the taxes are expected to argument that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has understood that Manning was maintained in accordance with the rules of application to all prisoners found under maximum preservation in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally providing information publishing on the Internet, filtering information on national defence and roof of ownership or public registers.
If it is declared guilty of all charges, it could be applied to perpetual chain.
My mexican identity crisis
Appeal that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexican people are tending to criticize those who have gone; he says they react to the Mexico people of those difficult times.
Navarrette comments that Mexico and Mexico are attained between two worlds.
In a recent journey to Mexico City, he had just been low by the explanated and reached the immigration traffic area and was already totally confused.
Some cards indicated the road to two rows: one for "Mexico" and another for "Extrangers".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
By growing in Central California, all my lives have called me "Mexico".
It's a ethnic tachygraphy, the same way my friends of Boston are referring to themselves as "Ireland" or my friends in New York, "Italian".
Later I decided by "mexican-e-e".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's patriarch, the tachygraphy or the scripts were not necessary.
It was simply and.
I speak Spanish, it's good enough to handle me during a interview in this language.
But I don't have the dictionary level of a national and I can't dismiss my American accent.
So I took my passport and put me in the foreign school.
I thought at the time of this week when the Mexico electoral President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
In the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries are gathered, it consisted of immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wanting to talk about the growth of the Mexico economy, one of the reasons for which at this time is so much that a Mexico man remains in Mexico as he is going to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block in North America with the European Union's style.
Moreover, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug courts in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is filled with remorse.
The majority of e ́s never agreed that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced their leaders to cease half of their territory at the point of gun.
But for the Mexico people, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that regain it are everywhere.
So, at the time one of the United States' officers says anything that takes the minimum critical to Mexico, you start hearing kids, both in the press and among the Mexico elite, about how the and ›s are enduring the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are put in war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really has a challenge is the one who has more than 35 million mexican and living in the United States.
Should we talk about the rock?
There's a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others that are not so.
The only reason for which there are so many mexican people living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point of our genealogic tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or any of the grandparents, to which the door of the opportunities in Mexico was closed and had to go to the north.
And most times that person was involved in a given profile: dark skin, low level of studies, resulting from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And although we may live now the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good works, we can never do what we live is that, the American dream, and not the Mexico.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is so.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are conscious that many of the Mexico people belonging to the elite of the leader class do not like them.
The feeling is mutuous.
It sees us as a reminder of a humiliating disaster and they look at us above the hobby as if we were from a lower category that is not the enough Mexico.
Our Spanish will never be enough good and our links with Mexico will never be sufficiently strong.
In his way of seeing, our existence is a failure synonym.
If our families hadn't missed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves captured after this seed corner, living well in the United States, but, even so, as sole souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and was legally born to the United States when she was a child, recalls me that there is this rock between the Mexico and the Mexico and the Mexican, because the first know more solidly who they are and the seconds this molest them.
Although he is citizen in the United States, it is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many mexican and I know feel that they are not part of any of the two.
We love to listen to the Mexico group Los Tigres del North, but too Bruce Springsteen.
You've got the best of every country, but you're not attracted to any of them.
In Mexico, they see us like and.
And in the United States, we are mexican.
Now, to complicate even more things, so I have heard during my travel, some Mexico leaders and some intellectuals want to connect to the diaspore again.
They want mexican and Mexico to work as "embads" of improvised Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our companions and to our friends the wonderful visiting that country and pressure the political leaders to strengthen their relationship with Mexico.
Yeah, of course...
That won't happen.
There's too much fucking.
And with the desiguality of salaries, galoping corruption and violence for drugs, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna stay alone with this idea, friends.
That's right.
If some Mexico people are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a half and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexico and Mexico are still feeling about how he treated their families ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Ancient battles, new Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could be a little base for peace
Can there be a long-term peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bleeding that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the middle of the unusual and usual discussions about whom the first is, many buildings have been reduced to sculptures; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civil, and six Israelites have been murdered, and for the first time missions from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aë, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the Israelites and the Palestinians seem to be angry in their former conflict, whatever they are about in the Middle East is changing.
The arabic primaver has left all the facts they like or not, the Palestinians and the Israelites have been arrested in the regional armor.
Maybe this makes your fight more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons for thinking that its deadly situation could be deceived.
A war that doesn't lose or win
Firstly, optimism now seems very difficult to justifie.
Even if the fire agreed on 21 November is maintained high, this week's halcons have strengthened both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the islamist movement that has governed Gaza since 2007, will have forced the Israelites to leave, despite Gaza has received a good palace.
And despite having killed some of their leaders and pressed the 1,7 million Gaza's people in one of the most miserable and popularies of the planet, Israel was not able to end with Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins land in West Jordania, the other part of Palestinian currently governed by Fatah's implacable rivals, the most moderated Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing for their favor.
Since the Islamists have won influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renewable regional power that had previously been the nearest Muslim alliation of Israel, has distorted the cause of Hamas. It has also made Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic states of Golf.
The joyful members of Hamas say that the middle islamic moon is around Israel, from the Libanon to the north, where he dominates the Milicia-Hizbula party, passing through Syria, where the rebels of a more islamist trend could destroy Bashar Assad, until the Jordan, where the Hamas covenants are threatening the king.
In particular, in the southern floor of Israel, the growth of the Muslim brothers addressed by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, in contrast with the most popular and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lake depote that ruled in Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had not too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim brothers are Hamas' first brothers and their leaders more than the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas is likely to come up as a protagonist to which it cannot be excluded, nor if it is Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard ala will take out the contrary conclusion.
As regards the military issue, Hamas has been placed on his site.
The Iron Cupula Iron System of Israel has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missions have been destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep quietly... for a while.
As regards the diplomacy, the United States is more stronger than ever; many European countries have also committed Hamas to have started the last oil of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a Prime Minister who has broadly ignored the peace process.
Although the shooting cockets from Gaza have ended with the lives of about 30 Israelites since 2004, Israel has not had too much suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that corrupts Cisjordania, the main part of a territory to become Palestinian, and protects the Jewish accommodations that continue to increase, despite the international legislation, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of still stronger lines led by Avigdor Lieberman during the previous elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why do you want those Palestinian retorted to be a own state?
If they really rule in the West Jordania, wouldn't they shoot cohetes such as their companions in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind that wall and give them a good shot if they lift their head up.
Perhaps the hard ala is put, although the Arab primavery could change its calculations.
Although islamists who take power in Egypt and other sites do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to cope with internal difficulties.
The defence budget of Israel is greater than the four of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economy.
That Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the high fire is a good thing and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think long-termly.
With the rest of the Arab world, turning to more democratic, the Palestinians of their right to self-determination must create a powder that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel A.
The repression is already increasing democracy in the Jewish state and demography emphasizes the situation as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza each two or three years in order to make Hamas will pay a diplomatic piece every time.
Both sides need a puzzle of people in the conflict.
The solution continues to be the one who makes senseful people from both sides, most of the outer world and this magazine: two states and the residence of the territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small to short-term, is that the high fire gives a little more impulse to the agenous people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, who must begin to put the weapons in Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is located in an unfair situation to convince Hamas that he accepts the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchanges and a Jerusalem.
The Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to join them.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a category of state in the United Nations.
Mr Obama also has an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiation table.
His first mandate dismissed its own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems like a resentment to dedicate your attention to you.
This is a deplorable vision of the future.
A sustainable Middle East is vital interest for the United States.
This involves a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The general tobacco packaging law enters into force
Warnings on the risks of smoking and part of the body with diseases light on the category of a green decked color, which are the same for all tobacco marks
The Australian law in the area of tobacco and generally empaqueted, pillared in the world, entered into force and substituted the logos and colors of the marks by an involtorium of a green exhaust, a wonderful picture of part of the body with diseases and representations of children and babys by being children of smoking parents.
On the basis of the various sane images and warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory from the Sabbath, is the names of the marks, all of them printed in a small source.
It is the strictest system of the world applied to the packaging of tobacco.
The Federal Government of Age is the goal to disobey young people to smoke by eliminating the races that make this habit glamour.
He trusted in studies that show that if a person hasn't started to smoke before 26 years, there is 99% of the possibilities that he will never.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is selling to Â of its mark," said the Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that showed, for example, how the girls related to the logo of a coronary with the idea of being a princess.
Although he has taken into account one of the lower rates of smokers in the world and that these changes will not affect too much the benefits of the multinationals, other countries are considered to take similar measures.
Tobacco industry has exercised a huge pressure against law.
Tobacco enterprises have encouraged the law to promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be better and more lasting.
"The legislation will cause serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre, from the British American Tobacco, in Âa.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that China and Indonesia will bring to sale in the streets.
Others say that their business has been benefited after the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, suggested that the request for silicone pillars and silicons to take the unpleasant images of the chatters had been shot almost two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had lost a refusal to the Law in the Supreme Court of Âa.
Mrs. Ha noticed that Zico had sold up to 6.000 units to majorist establishments and was waiting for more existence.
"For us is a good business."
Experts are, the possibility of obstacles is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is guided.
After a series of Australian laws that prohibit publicity in television and sport patrocinium and who commit most sellers to not put cigarettes in view, the marketing of the tobacco has passed online.
It has made publicity on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot be restricted on external pages.
"If you market tobacco and just stay this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convinced place in which you are," said Becky Freeman, research of public health from the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in records on marks from "state citizens" published on social network pages such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
You should ask if it's just a private citizen who really loves the Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the moleesty to perform a video or if any marketing company is behind it.
The British American Tobacco indicated that the industry is more focused on what the new legislation involves than on marketing.
The industry has even been paying for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new standards; these countries are faced with the World Trade Organization that is injustly restricting trade, although no of these countries has a significant trade volume with rubber.
The WTO has a middle 2013 resolution.
Plibersek said that the Government had held conversations with other countries that are considered to apply similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country that introduced the obligation to include images in the category.
They are currently binding in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considered to apply harder laws.
Many smokers in ́a show challenges.
"The graphics do not affect me.
I'm not just doing your case."
"You take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Really, there is only one reason I would stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that uniform castles make him more complicated to put them in the station.
"Normally a hour late to draw a delivery; now late four," Yu.
"The government should have completely performed the tabac and then, it's already, well, it's done and we'll close the tent," he says while he's raised his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little crazy
I had to take five hours in a port because the aircraft in which we fled suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had a lot of time to think about the crazy.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
A half day in a gate waiting for a flight to come, it is pretty funny, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without seeing us from the duty-free tents.
But every time there are more academics and experts in child development than elogizes the goodness of abusiveness.
If they are, it's good that, both we and our children, we're once in the time.
The brain is obligated to seek interesting options and may promote creativity.
Since the majority of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits that result in disturbance.
So, should we be courageous to accept the disappointment?
Yeah.
And not.
But we're going to talk about it forward.
Firstly, as many people, we had to have more time for the oxy, the shame would be a recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey, the Cathedral of the Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, Canada, and the author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The abortion, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale日 Press, is not so.
"In fact, the story of disturbance is very low,"
In Pompeya's walls, there are graphfites in Latin on the deterioration of the I.C.
We should also imagine how we definite abusiveness.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very different ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology of the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and putting the idea before a group of discussions formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the disturbance as the experience of "being, but not able, to participate in a work that fills you."
I mean, the difference between disturbance and apathy is that the person doesn't do anything but wants to do it.
Sign that with the pathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of disturbance, is "the change of attention process, associated with a low state of encouragement and a feeling that the time passes slowly."
Abortion can sound terriblely similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are depressed tend to see the problem as an issue of the environment or the world, while those who are depressed consider that the problem is theirs.
Sometimes we think we are crazy, when what really happens to us is that we have problems to focus on ourselves.
In your study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were sent to a previous experiment in which the participants listened to a circle of a person who read the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened to a television program in the contiguous room for any volume that had no relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was simply perceived, while the third group didn't listen to the audio at any moment.
The group who listened to the programme with the volume under showed more disturbance than the other two groups; they costed to concentrate, but they were not sure of why and allocated it to the disturbance.
"When you focus on a difficult or interesting task, the change of attention can lead to disturbance," Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neurocidence of the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something crazy, like detecting defectuous parts in a manufacturing line, a music that distractions you can help you not be buried."
"In fact, now we know that move or make garbates, actions that often are interpreted as a sign of disturbance, can actually help fight it, because they make that person physically warner."
"The research shows that those children who are allowed to be moved more and more information than those who are obligated to be quiet," Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's to be crazy at some point: the retraction of a plane, a monotonic speaker, a particularly crazy movie.
But some people have more trends than others.
To help meet it, some researchers developed a "treatment scale in the 1980s".
The scale includes questions such as "much of the things I have to do are repeattive and monotons" and "There are so many things that I am interested that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology of the University of West Florida, who, using these scales, researchers have discovered that guys have more trends to be disturbed than girls, and particularly need more external and more different stimulation.
But in general, teenagers are a kind of group that is very easy.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of Human Development and Community of the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he was contacted with 400 teenagers and his parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of the teenagers said he would be buried while he was at the school or did the debt, while 23 percent said he would be buried when he was not at the school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they would be buried.
Professor Larson said that I didn't know whether the current percent of disturbance, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "adultance is a period in which the abortion reaches its highest cottons", mostly because both children and adolescents are not granted a great control on what they want to do.
So, returning to my question of the beginning: is it good to be disturbed?
Sometimes it is not because, leading to the extent, it can make us exposure to absurd physical risks, such as to put up or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as shown by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak about the connection between abortion and creativity, the Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two deities.
"Gary Marcus, professor of psychology of the University of New York, is the way the brain has to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus.
But the brain doesn't always know what's the nearest.
If you're crazy and use that energy to touch the guitarra or cook, it'll be satisfied.
But if you see the television, it's likely to satisfy you for a short time, but not for a long time.
"So, if your son is crazy and gives him a iPad, it is possible that he will not breathe anymore, but it will not have been able to enter into himself or to do it," Professor Fenske.
And " that ability to do-dose is applied to other operations," it states.
Your son is not just to keep himself alone, but to be better controlled in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise the crazy.
But we shouldn't be too critical with him.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable paragraphs of the continuous voice of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to be more deceived, but abortion is a too anxious and anxious desire as to relate to something that deserves the pen."
It indicates that what people really are looking for is a way of disappointing and enjoying a dead time.
"In a environment in which we are constantly overestimated," -- it's difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the voice stops.
Colored: No book of instructions for the new law on marihuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year student in a Community institution and a footballist in south-east Colorado, is to be a criminal process for something that will soon be legal in all the state: the position of some rocks and a pipe used to smoke it.
Orrozco says that on September, he and some friends were driven by Lamar, in the nearby border of Kansas, when the police stopped them.
The police found marihuana in the car and a time later, Orozco received a legal quotation for drugs and related articles (small crimes that each took a 100 dollars and $s) in which it was reported on the date of the judgment.
"We are treated as criminals," says Orozco.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty followed by the vote in Colorado for legalization of small marihuana tension for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes for drug tension depends less than the law.
hundreds of smaller crimes by marihuana position are cancelling both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have stopped to submit charges against the older than 21 years of poison at small scale, which will be legally approved after the law has entered into force in the next weeks.
But the most conservative taxes in Colorado have been committed to continue with the cases open by marihuana posation and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from Denver's suburbs to the Western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of houses of marihuana, recently authorised in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what's going to be next," said Daniel J. Oates, police head in Aurora, right east of Denver.
Those who are responsible for the regulations in Washington state are also devoted to the matter.
And they are still looking for advice to establish a system of production, production, distribution and sale licences; all of this before the date reached, on 1 December 2013.
They say, for good or bad, Colorado goes before the majority of the states regarding the regulation of marihuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it'll be a good guide," – Brian E.
But Mr. Äthith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what it could work.
"There's no true Property that serves us as a model,"
The Washington law, I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which two waters will be born, since the licence system in that state will not exist yet, but the position will be legal.
In addition, there are some delegated mechanical issues that should be resolved during that period, such as the way of maintaining a balance between the need for the state to offer a "detailed access" to the authorised marihuana and their ability to perform cannabis business in a radio less than 300 meters of schools, parkings, infantial game areas or infantic centres.
"In nowhere, it will be more difficult to locate a authorised cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, a recent research group.
On 21 November, Oates, the police officer of Aurora, sent a mail to his police officers in which he informed them that the town's taxor would stop to interfere with legal acts for low deficiency of marihuana to persons older than 21 years and that the police would stop submitting charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
The police officer Oates said that they would be able to comply with the law of the city regulating marihuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue traffickers and drug sales.
In the Weld conduit, north of Colorado, Ken Buck represents a more stretching vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue marihuana possion cases, mainly to press consumers and to be determined to be treated.
Currently, 119 people are charged by 56 grams or less marihuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to interfere with judicial action against the lack of crimes at the time they were made," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places such as the Board of Board, where the voters have initiated the initiative on the legalization of marihuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city of the court, has no longer quoted adults for small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, the tax of the court, supported this decision, but also decided not to disapproval any of the cases in question.
"I don't think you're losing time to continue to fulfill the law until this change," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered that the use of marihuana for recreational use of the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictorial reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence between the officers in relation to the great experiment of the public.
"There is a cultural barrier with the taxes of the halt", Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver, who represents the accused of marihuana and is a local carrier of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on Marihuana.
"They have passed so much time by bringing people to the courts that, in fact, they can still not accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states that consider the small quantities of marihuana in the same way as if it was alcohol, Colorado and Washington, they are prepared to become test cases at national level as regards drug legalization.
While state lawyers and officers are accounting for a new legal sales border, they also expect to receive indications from the Federal Government, which still predict the consideration of sales and marihuana cultivation as federal crimes.
Defensors of marihuana legalization have the hope that the Department of Justice is late.
Despite some highlighted arrests of patients and marihuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the Federal Government has allowed in its majority that there are marihuana sales businesses for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although the anti-drogue agents do not bring ports down to confiscate a small drug bottle, they will probably be shown reactions to enable the operation of tents regulated by the state for the sale of marihuana for recreative use, allowed in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drogue policy exhaustor of the administration of Obama.
A number of towns in Colorado do not expect the federal authorities to act.
Even before the day of the elections, some local governments adopted moratories on any new house of marihuana, although it will pass about a year before any of them could open.
Last week, the Western city of Montrose adopted six months and it was to adopt it the next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, member of the meeting.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted before voting for what the state voted."
There are many questions about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I've been able to get out of Oxford for being a Tory."
The universities are not attacked for their viewpoints only now
I don't remember any moment in my life where I haven't dreamed to get a place at the University of Oxford.
My father and my older brother had been in which I supposed was the best place of the world to ́er, a Greek symposium of the modern era that promoted the two pilares of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks of occupation of my place at the Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to curse the history career, I had already done the males, which designed the first scandal of my life.
My father was broken down and stopped crying.
My friends were unconcerned.
The The Evening Standard reported that I had abandoned because it wasn't tolerating that some university partners held sexual relations in the room nearby.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced that I was gone because they forced me to drink in uncovered tasses.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone out of there.
Yes, I was away because I was subjected to an accommodation systematic and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was stuck for one reason, that in the council of the present illustration was something intolerant and barbarous: my father, the dead Woodrow Wyatt, was a highlighted adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservator party.
Maybe you're wondering what's going on now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of students in the centre is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutional and growing hatred to the students of the Conservative Party is in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights with homosexual, discapacitated and ethnic minorities.
Conserving members of the JCR (Grouping of Students) of the Corpus Christi College, they are often "seriously severe, personally attacked and treated as ungrate people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the Equality Committee of opportunities of their university college to ensure that they can express their opinions freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent documentary of BBC2 called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Young, Young, Bright and on the Right) on the policy of students and presented to the Tories as excentric and neonazis.
He showed the post-grade student Joe Cooke, expert of the Association of the Oxford University Conservator (OUCA) party in a Rolls-Royce, covering a silver tray and a baston with silver pumping.
In other universities, conserving students say that they are treated as "Turkey heads" by the introduction of higher matrix rates.
Luke Black, 20-year-old and president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a dominic period that " there is a growing trend of links at universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even if he knows us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old and historical student in Corpus Christ, who presented the movement to a greater protection, that this environment is "incompatible", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and elected president of the OUCA, that the responsibility of the members of the JCR to those who are from the center of .
"This is a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the welfare of the members."
I had my first weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, a 18 - year - old youth was terriblely tired.
The hate to the Conservator Party was at its highest point.
In the previous year, the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher, the former student, a "honoris cause" title after the discourse in the financing of the Superior Education.
The environment would have made anxious to any stalinists.
For the first days of the week of welcome to the new universities, when new students are known and known to the Cathedrals, I received a demonstration of the bitterness I expected.
I discovered that the Cathedrals did not just make the fat view of the moph that was made from the conservators, but participated in it with good profit.
The miners' bulga policy, the privatization and the opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wood rooms of the seminar.
The first attendance was to be translated to the English French texts of the XVIII century and I was not prepared for what I came next.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Catedral Harry Pitt (you deceived), " Please translate the first paragraph."
I don't know anybody.
Pitt, a man low with a face that looked like a bizcock mass, knew well how to exhaust bad birds.
"Is that that thatcherists refuse to be French or is that, simply, they're stupid?" asked he.
The other universities rided.
I was burning the eyes of the lambs that I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you to go to French classs in your free time, always and when I'm not too busy knowing people," Pitt wounded.
I rejoiced in my room as a penny soul.
That night I felt alone at the time of the dinner at the university, and then I felt a light palmed on the street.
He was a second-year English student named James who was present as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," he said to me.
"I'm afraid that's how the thing goes.
They're stuck with anyone who's suspecting to be Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know that your father's near Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Many Tories recently came to appear to be laborists."
Before, in a local pub, I tried to decimally.
I insisted that I didn't agree with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
That truck was unusual.
A first-year student of Philosophia, Policy and Economy who, paradoxally, had studied in Eton, said, "You are a daughter of a fascist shepherd.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the perverted switch.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"You're giving one to another, don't you?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 60s.
Would you ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would you see me obligated to stay with people who thought like me just after the night?
Would you have to make me worker and repress my natural trends?
The three years I expected were presented as a cleaner of ostracism and isolation.
The only Cathedral openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my university college.
They hated him not only for the Conservator party but also for thatcher's adviser in external policy and one of the people who wrote his talks to him.
I was just there.
He hated the place that he considered it provinciously and insignificant and for its adherence to the marxist-determinist vision of the history.
In 1997, he accepted a chat at the Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said to me.
I started to move every day from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding me in my family and friends of more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father to hate Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 40s, all political points were accepted.
"But if it's the best place of the world," he tried.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear clusters.
Even my communist friends have always had an impecable."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just to brome.
My heart would be separated if you left it."
With so many travels to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
One of my friends, who also supported the Conservative Party, had undertaken the pressure and had rejected his faith.
The next week, during a seminar in which another cathedral of history had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, I was a "fear of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red to see inside, I admitted that my parents had "slaved my brain" and I called them " stupid old."
The tree took a little time.
It was my father who put the last key on my university career at Oxford.
Then my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's pressure.
My door was closed with the key.
I was inside of fear and, in the past five minutes, my guests left.
When I went out, I took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak lorone.
But no 18-year-old person should be subject to such intimidation and enemies in a educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that Oxford was, which has not only formed 14 first ministers of the Conservator party but, today, is hidden after a reputation of nothing deserved of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notority"
Because of the "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which has been invoked this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, an ancient residence in Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of achieving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognised it during the inscription of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apotheological that gathers more than 130 high-coast clothes created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his inconfundable Italian accent.
This show is the colofon of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but that could not have been written without its different customers.
Valentino always feels fascination for the inner and remote world of nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, open to the next 3th March, there are private letters and photos with the signature of the most granted of the aristocracy, from the Princesa Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passed by the Princesa Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino refers to those personal memories as trophes of its social ascension: humble modesty of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the "jet-seven" international.
Loving the reality has nothing wrong.
"They're at least not pulling their pillars on your wonderful alphobra as they do some beautiful celebrities of the pop music," says the Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alpes and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular employee and maintains generosity and elegance.
"All of us enjoyed to be invited to your chalet in Gstaad," explains the exhibitor of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate of beautifulness as Marella Agøji or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to notority.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting a Valentino
The argentin model Valeria Mazza also doesn't live the carism of the modist.
A lot of years ago, after a defil in Piazza di Spain, in Rome, we flew to kiss it.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the stage, decoration, food, music, in all things, was seen and feeling his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," replies the "top model", which eats to work with him during the High Costure Week of Paris in 1995.
"Never pass by mode because your designs are artificial works," she concluded.
Authentication Output
Garavani's life is not a story of depths, but of well-compatible love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's gallerys has been transformed into a passport of sixty meters long passport that proposes a change of role: the visitor takes the place of the models and must shield through the passport to see a "subsidiction" that lights works of Valentino teachers, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, the clothes used by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a cover of lana and skin that belonged to the Farah Empiretriz Diba.
In this public of maniquies, names such as the Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the modist, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "incapable of vital."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pantalon, a camisa, a "gillette" chaleco and a cook of the ottone winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muscles.
"I prefer him above others for his femaleness, for his great love for women, because he reveals our beautifulness," adds the former duquesa of Feria.
I like the colors that use, have a great light and are "donants" at the face.
Proportions are perfect.
The princess and prescriptive of the Mode Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco can evide the first time he saw a Valentino.
When she was teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed about having the age and opportunity to be able to use one of his night traces...
Finally, the time arrived at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first clothes of Valentino to use at a party at my grandfather's castle, Prince Edouard de Line.
It was a red tragedy, with a floor of flights, "corsage" shot and listening to the word of honor.
"It was a real dream," says Rodrigo's widow of Arenberg.
"Valentino is indiferent to mode, its existence is the atmosphere," explains this Italian aristocrate that lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps his clothes of a festival of the modist with "the most careful... because a clothes is not just a clothes, it is also the set of memories that I take."
The "key" of the mode
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the travel of Marie-Chantal Miller in her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
Four months of work were needed and 25 "raga" (as called the modist to their couchs) to develop that marph coloured seed with perles incrossings, twelve different types of encage and a four-medium school.
The journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized pressure, which clothing represents a hito of the high coast of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnubilated for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is his best example.

Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala at the Orsay Museum.
He was on the table of the Jacqueline condess of Ribes, my great friend.
"It was impecable, the time isn't going to pass for him."
If a princess says that...
The worst office in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian vulcan carriers are playing life and health by loading 70 kilograms of sugar for ≥ 70 kg of stones of stone empinements
There are people for whom your work is a dinner and another who, literally, works in the dinner.
It's the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who win life out of the Kawah Ijen volcano, on the east of the Indonesia island of Java.
For this, it must be down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas that educes from the earth’s entrances is solidized when it comes into contact with the air.
After dragging big sugar rocks, which totally reach about 70 kilos, the bambooes are carrying in two bamboes that carry on their cows to ≥ scarped rocks.
It's only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is up to 2.386 meters of height, but the exhaust carriers are late for more than 40 minutes to go up to the torture step, keeping the balance and mixing their steps with tent to not be packed and falling through the precipicium.
They know that any transfusion could cost them life, as happened to a French tourist who was dismissed for the risks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen Miners win 5 cents of euros for each kilo of sugar they extract
Once up, the tourists are opened to the tourists who graphify them as if they were circle monos and, loading the weak canasters hardly, walking three miles to the balance that a miner company has made a little lower, at 1.850 meters of height.
It is PT Candi Ngrimb, a company exploding the volcan since 1960 and never better said to his employees, which pays 662 Indonesian rupes (5 centimeters of euro) for each kilogram of sugar.
Then he sells it for 100,000 rupias (83 cents of euros) to petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in daily life and is used to manufacture circles, artificial fires, cosmetics, dinamites and even to white sugar.
"As normal is to load 70 kilos, we take about 46,000 rupias (3,8 euros) in each travel," explains Anto, who is supposed to perform three daily doors.
It takes three hours each and ends moving, but it allows you to join 138.000 rupias (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a poverty for such an unhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would win in the field.
"The miners' journal is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupias (1,2 euros) on the day and the average salary of men is of two million rupias (167 euros) ", states the carrier, which was earlier working as albanish in the Bali Island tourist.
There, his ship was 75.000 rupias (6.2 euros) on the day, and the tattoo was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby villain people, for a weight reason that, in Indonesia, it becomes so constant as the sugar: "I married a young Bali, where they are hinduists, and I brought it to Java to become Islam."
Then he has asma, breathe with difficulty, tose constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases
At its 27 - year - old, Anto takes three games in Kawah Ijen, whose sugar has already started to cross the fashion, despite covering his face with a special mask and wheel.
He has asma, breathe with difficulty, tose constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that disrupt vulcan.
It's the price you must pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two years more because I want to open a tent or study a Spanish or French," it promises in a English more acceptable than acceptable.
Castled by life, this beautiful and smart young man could be tourist, friend or recipient of a hotel, but instead does the work of a mule.
Sharing a unclean wood cab with other carriers, it rises every day to the two of the morning because the sugar does not stop moving tonight, when its characteristic yellow color returns to and is in the middle of darkness.
By dealing with the shadows, Anto lowers the crater with a small lingery attached to his cask, which he himself has bought with his money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the sugar waste on their shoes from the bottom of the crater
Despite its benefits, the miner company has not mechanized the extraction of the sugar to cover costs or provide any equipment to the carriers who work for their account and the weight.
In fact, not if it is part of the 30,000 rupses (2.5 euros) of reload by camera that, at the income of 15.000 rupses (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park cover the tourists coming to photograph the volcan and their human mules.
"This work is for animals and not for people," protests Madrisin, a 42-year-old delivery carrier in Kawah Ijen three deities, since he left the college.
You can rise up to 110 kilos, make sure you will endure working "all you can" because you need money to educate your three children, from 18 to 10 years.
I'm not going to jubel, I'm gonna die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sugar burns the gargant and listens to the eyes when the wind changes of improvization and catches mineres in the spices of the columns that come out of the volcano, it is so hard that no one is weak to suffer serious diseases... out there, clearly, of its habitual respiratory problems, artrosis, pains in the rods and beds in the wheels, which have been malformed by the weight of losses.
By equilibring the canaster on your shot, Uninik can only load 50 kg at its 53 years.
Each day, he and his companions drag 15 tonnes of sugar to the volcan, which three trucks transfer to Tamansari storage, to 18 miles away by a way of goats between the male.
"I won't jubel, I'm gonna die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Uninik declares well opening the mouth, where he missed several teeth.
From his five children, the elder of 30 years, also works by wearing blue.
The time passes, but the perpetual poverty of generation in generation one of the most hard offices of the world: which makes the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looks for children to save the economy
Singapores guilty the career, stress and cost of properties and education because they have no children.
"Singapura's population needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, let's fill our civil responsibility and we create life!
It may seem invermosimal that these verses are part of an announcement of menta palettes, but despite that - or maybe because of that - the video became viral in YouTube in Singapur at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap using local references such as "We're going to put a bao (bool) in the horn" to laugh from the Singapur birth rate.
The publicity company who made the video, BBH, has the hope that with the announcement they can call attention on the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use music power to comply with "their national debt".
This is something clean from the Internet, so we had to do it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world to play ourselves, so we felt that this was a subject that we had to face.
We knew that the government had done many things, such as launching perfumes with feromons or organizing guards of quick citations (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do the most creatively possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 Children
The government of Singapore is not taking it so easy.
US$300 per year in policy to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents allows up to $15,000 per child, extends licences for maternity and shares tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-technological city in Southeast Asia, also known by the conservatorism of its leaders and its extreme social controls.
The rate of birth in Singapore, according to its national division of population, is currently situated in 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was over 2 - known as reposition rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapores have children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Matrix Policy and Family of the National Department of Population, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a larger range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a larger range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, rather than marrying and forming a family," explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase of solety, and to duration of marriage and birth, which results in reducing birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy points to drastic increase in the immigration to make it to the decrease of the population has developed a sense between the local population.
In Singapore there are web sites where xenophobia is only disfracted against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who criticize to maintain low salaries and do not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore Government party has experienced its worst electoral results from independence in the past year.
From elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and records for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the rate of birth has known effects on the growth of a nation's economic growth, tax income, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has some unexpected consequences.
The government does not build so many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the immobiliary sector.
The urban development authority has passed to control the number of small apartments, known as "boat box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful.
However, there is anxiety that they can promote a lifestyle of singleness and disappoint developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobiliary Company EL ↓ers, says that their "spats boxes" are selling much faster than the largest units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units are spent days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it be much better for our box flow.
However, it admits that the new standards provide clearer guidelines for developers, which would have been set up before if they wanted to offer too small units in a project.
Too Stressed
Singapore is a State city.
Although these new rules may be a step towards the increase of national birth rate, talking to the Singapores who work in the financial area of the centre that will not have much effect.
"The people are very stressed, the houses are faces, and it is also education, so many people do it," says a young executive.
Others can have children.
"But it is important for me to count my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of properties and education, such as the reasons that they do not have children.
So because the government is trying to empowere his citizens to have children, when it's about to make children, the Singapores are those who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Real Ajumamia Spanish, it is the quality of private or "the area of private life which is right to protect from any income".
What is private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in its daily life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to those exposed by ventilation on the Internet which would certainly not be out of line?
the Periodic interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years, often users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with " something very myself" on personal basis, and "in the key and name of the user", when it was applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't go up to a post," says Jorge, for ten years, when I explain the meaning of privacy in sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where you have accounts for two years ago.
"They're very secret secrets, my mother can meet them, but not all of them."
In FB I'm up to beautiful images or games.
I'm also interested in my friends.
"I wouldn't have a photo that is not mine, or someone who's doing the ridiculous," he says.
The child recognises that it is wrong to publish obscenal graphics, disgusting people, crimines, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure you know the 35 friends you have in the FB and your nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are parental.
Mother is included, he has the key of one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express me and write interesting Twitters.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just get them up," adds.
"Social networks are entertained, I can talk to remote parents or to my friends quickly," says.
I don't doubt to answer that I would never accept a request for an unknown person.
I wouldn't give anybody to recommend a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask in this last admit to do not know 20 of the people joined in his list of friends.
"Not for me, because we have something in common, for example music," says.
It is the boy, no one has been instructed to him or has requested the address of his house or phone number.
"If they press me or they just take it from my account," he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, then reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy doesn't have the experiences of what today is known as ciberbullying.
One of my friends knew that they were extorting him in a social network.
They threatened him and needed him money.
"I never know who he was," she assured.
The victim, Joseph, did not close the account.
"I just put him privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account safe.
The difference of Jorge, this boy would bring up photos of familiars in uncomfortable or pregnancy.
Yeah, I'd, if it's wrong or I'll get you.
"Although I know that it's ciberbullying."
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and licensed in Education and Learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"Internet came as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the game rules changed," it says.
Porras points out that Marc Prensky Academic, master in Pedagogia by the Yale University and author of the Digital National and Immigrant Work, has reached these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital nationals are they, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we are still doing," he says.
It comments that the theme is complete, "for we ask you to have a definite criteria on what it should or not distribute, publish or say to an age that the maturity does not give for it."
"And they are selective when the most important thing you are is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," adds.
The most effective way of showing what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them that he doesn't serve it," he added.
Then, Perras mentioned some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to make a photo of you like that you published of a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When holiday photo tags, have you requested the other people permission to label them?
And another, everyone needs to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do it offline.
They're the same rules.
"One outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality, and other principles, must be equal to social networks."
Vigilance
Stuardo Guardia, university cathedral, primary teacher and educational adviser, comments that it is essential that family parents read the social network policies.
Understanding each of the incisions they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening a account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to be published or published," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remember the lesson of "not talking with strangers".
Finish the Onesur's Cumber without making public the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidency meeting of the South American Union of the United Nations (Unasur) has been concluded today in Peru without publicing the Lima Declaration, announced previously and theoretically subscribed by the seven assistant mandate.
Efe tried to repeat opportunities to the document signed at the VI Orderary Meeting of State and Government of the Onesur, but the sources of Cancilleria and Presidency signed at a start that would deliver it after the clause, but then they made that it would be published at some time on the Peruan Government's website.
In consultation with the text, they noted that the content had been expressed by the President of Peru, Olanta Humala, during a few short statements on the press.
The access of journalists to the summary information was at any time limited.
The newspaper was only transmitted in the press room the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information he had among the reporters was delivered by the press portfolio of some of the United Nations Governments to the citation, although not the Peruan.
The only document issued during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the painting of hundreds of journalists of various national and international media that requested greater data.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summary, but it is about Humala's pronunciation, not from the official document that closed the summary.
In October past, Peru was the officer of the III Cumber America of South Arabia (ASPA), and in that case, despite being insistently required by the press, it was also not distributed the called Lima Declaration that had previously announced.
In the ASPA's official website, the document was published last Wednesday.
At both international meetings, the Peru authorities efforts to ensure that transmission systems were insured for all journalists but limited at least information.
The summary also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a mistake of the Court of Haya that leads a different border between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered during the regional meeting and cared that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in La Haya to listen to the alegates of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We're going to catch and execute the judgment which defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with its Chilean par.
"Chile has been, and will continue to be a respectful country of international law, peaceful solution for conflicts, treaties and international courts," Piñera approved, and he welcomed Humala with an approximation of hands, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would be subject to the CIJ has then occurred that Colombia declared this week the Bogotá ' s decree that he had accepted to submit the failures of that international court, and then a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua which considered seriously wrong.
The summary was performed with the inassistences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Onesur since 2011 after its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The Adfitrion President, Ollanta Humala, was the responsible for opening the decisions in the morning and closing the cover, shortly after the middle of Lima.
The mandatary read the final document in which it informed that 16 agreements were adopted and that the action lines were fixed for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, UNASUR countries would give important steps to the purpose of a South American citizenship for what we expand the residence agreements.
He informed that "the cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and the transnationally organized crime, action to make medicines more eligible, Internet access to low price in all South America rivers, and to focus on the risks of natural disasters."
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (the Latin America) should not have a triunphalist matrix but should be used to expand our production matrix and view a better future for our people," Humala acknowledged.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblamatic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas...associating our countries and generating new economic circuits," Peruan President said in a reading message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of their territory, from the side to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country serves for its re-corporation to the Union of South America", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to maintain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and good relationship between neighbors, was another of the issues underlined by the summary.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet with his parent of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the Sabbath in Mexico to treat the different maritime after a failure of the CIJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning (saturday) is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We'll review all these ways, they're not exclusive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he subrayed.
"As President Ortega, I hope I can tell you that we are doing this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would be found on the Sabbath in Mexico where they intended to attend the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Moreover, as part of the summary, the Defense Ministers of the Bloc had previously gathered to approve the Action Plan of 2013, seeking to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on Defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the presidency for the time of the regional block.
"Suramerica must be European to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case, should be European".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidency meeting of the South American Nations Union (Unasur) held in Lima, declared to the Peru state TV that the Europeans were killed in the Second World War and in other conflicts, "but now they are nearly a country".
In this regard, he defended the draft establishment of the South American citizenship that enhanced the Member States of the Unsur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved by any South-American country, as it already happens to the integrants of the Andina Community, but there are still new sectors that want us to be in the past," he warned.
The Ecuatorian President was also shown in favour of the reconciliation of the United States Organization (OEA) under the premium to decrease the influence of the English States and to take account of those signed by the San José Treaty on Human Rights.
Those who give a catedra never commit themselves to anything and, rather, the South Americans are signing everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he advised the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Corree has assured that he is not repentant of that decision because he has not granted his principles but has respected his "profund democracy and human rights".
He claimed that, at his time, " there were doubts founded that Assange was extradited to a third country and did not respect his process."
He also criticized the Swedish justice for submitting to the questionnaire in its territory by a sexual crime assumption when "the Swedish legislation allows it to be carried out through video conference, which could be done since Ecuador's embailing in London".
Correa warned that there is the risk of deteriorating the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I didn't talk to him since he was in our ambassador, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Equatorian mandatary.
What is true is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health by being closed in a small space without being able to exercise free air.
"This complicates the health of any person," he said.
Correa noted that the solution to asylum authorised to Assange since June in the equatorian campaign in London, by the concession of a safe conduct that allows you to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities, and stressed that he had conversations with London in the search of a solution to the inheritance of WikiLeaks Foundation.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we don't use it in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures in different European instances," he mentioned.
And he thought, "If the Great Britain gives tomorrow the salvation of this ends."
And if Switzerland, as perfectly allows her legislation and as he has done in other cases, ask Mr Assange in the Ecuador Empire in London or ask him by Skype tomorrow this problem is over.
Correa used to reaffirm himself as a defense of the freedom of press and murder, which doesn't tolerate is "the median faith, the wicked faith and the lie, which distorted the freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of press are not the wicked and wrong politicians but the bad journalists depending on profit, chanting and extortion," he said.
In this regard, it was congratulated that these journalists were no longer "not the bankers or the Hegemone and Burguese countries dominated by Ecuador", and that, in order to be reelected, "the revolution will be profunded to continue the path and the right direction".
Corree also supported the decision to keep the veto in Paraguay in the Unsur at least until its next elections, argumenting that the body " must be firm and not tolerate the opportunity and golpism of legality" because "destro" is the legitimateness of paraguay democracy.
The Equatorian President also considered the " perfectly relevant" desire of its Colombian homolog, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the sea limits between both countries after the failure of the International Court of Justice of La Haya, which benefited from the Nicaragua Maritime Sovereignty.
That error isn't happening for now.
It's a problem between a South American country and a center-American.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will of walking together.
We need to process them in a wide way to overcome them and continue.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of maritime litigation that remained in the same court of Peru and Chile and said "is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit to accept a mistake in the same case."
With regard to the possibility of candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to search for a third consequent mandate, he pointed out that the possibility is "with very optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very hard."
Corree assured that if he lost the committees of February 2013, he will get away from the public life.
I have never been interested in the personal, but in the injustices as the Ecuador's, this social economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who guaranteed that victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If you win, it would be my last period in the presidency and we would get out of the public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," she said.
Correa also refers to the new health treatment of the Venice President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to the Venice president Nicolas Maduro and said that he was traveling to a treatment that was already planned, of routine, which was expected to take place the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a recycling in the health status of President Chavez," he recommended.
The Equatorian State Chairman today participated in Lima in the VI Country of State and Government of the South American United Nations (Unasur), which concluded with a greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Deaths for Sida today are caused by late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when confirmed the result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if a bomb falls on me," refers to remembering the time of the announcement, that the doctor was making "the more swift" without clear success.
The boy hid him to his family.
She decided to be charged only about her disease and eat to inform her about her; with such an effort that she had already celebrated her birthdays 43.
It is, of course, one of the elderly patients of the AIDS of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (VIH) since 22 years ago, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stegma.
So, until the manager of a clinic of the IMSS avoided to get away from him "for he brought a cut."
So the SIDA was the sinonymous of death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and make it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of your disease, many still come when the virus has already caused stripes, "apported" its immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the world AIDS appearance, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this moment that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely way and the survival of the general population is exactly equal," indicated the leader of the HCG VIH Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was assessed in April this year in a citizenically prestigiated publication.
Infectologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva recommended that since 2008, the scientists had concluded that the AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of surface and quality of life of impact on the immune system presenting patients at the start of diagnosis, with a better expectation for those who are not drug users: from up to 30 years with a total of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the preceding means that whoever receives the positive HIV diagnosis at the age of 25, under these terms "without maintaining control can live without problems until the 75 years", explained the interview.
To measure this progress, it is necessary to remember that the life hope of the Mexico people today is of 76 years in average.
Although mortality has been significantly reduced in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who die from aid was lower than 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have fallen since the AIDS appearance.
Only in Jalisco 255 people failed in 2011, and 187 deaths until May of this year; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- Why still have deaths?
- I think the problem isn't about access to treatment.
That's how visual it is, that's what happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had a disorder of medicine, the problem is that patients are very advanced because they do not know their condition of infection, or in the past phases of the disease.
God is a constant data: "9 of each ten patients comes when they already have any opportunistic infection that must be done to have a greater impact on the global mortality, is to do more timely diagnosis and therefore must be offered tests of detection in massive manner, to all people who react it."
In its proposal, specialists and officers of the State Council for the Prevention of Sida in Jalisco (Coesida), also the own patients, such as Fabrizio, who came to prove to a particular hold, only motivated because he had made it a friend and, despite his short age, was already in a stage of AIDS and even suffered a sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that was one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have a sida.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'm better back three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medicines.
On the date, your parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life, like anybody.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, travel, I have a active sexual life, but I am responsible, I care for me and the other person," Fabrizio, who accepted to make his intimity with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his witness to those today, in the framework of the World Day of Sida, they have fear.
What the tests are made, if they had a risk, that, between soonly, they know whether they are positive HIV, it is better and if they already have diagnostics, that they can live as any person, being responsible.
This, your message, summarizes the battle lem to the side this 2012.
Condones after display
Great are the sites between health programmes and the common citizen, Ricardo Salazar, Tapatian journalist who has adopted the case in return to HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the share of condones has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us a hundred packages, and that is very well but results that there are people today, yet have no access to a condone," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with social, school guidelines, pharmacists and health personnel, to which teenagers do not want to expose, the communicator assures.
I proposed to reorient this inefficiency divided; the condons are not only after the showers and those hundreds are found in public bathroom sprayers of the sites of young people frequently.
It is not motivating promiscuity.
It is not about paying them the halls and the motel, as manager Emilio González responded, as he asked if he would have shared preservatives in his employment.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to approach condones to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 SIDA and 1.317 HIV).
The state is the fourth national place in new and accumulated cases of HIV and 13°.
92% of the counties correspond to the sexual way, 6% to the bloodway and 2% to the perinatal way.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people can live with HIV because for a case recorded there are 4 to 5 people who don't know.
Ratified by a United States appointment court a sentence that does not know the debt repeat of the Vitro Group resulted in a marketing concurrence in Mexico, the scenario places a disadvantage for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures on signatures allowing mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical area, the spread to the sentence issued on June 15, by judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bancarrotes for the North Eight of Texas, leaves indefensive to mexican signatures against the possibility of immigration of their properties in all the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to join the Supreme Court of the United States, appealing three inconsistences.
Income, while the judge of the case points out that the creditors should be governed by the United States Queebras Law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuito, sitting in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the marketing complaint made in Mexico.
The first point would involve the ignorance of international processal cooperation in cases of enterprises with transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of the International Mercantil Right was created as an arbitr the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the sentence states that without the vote of intercompanying, recognised in the critical mass of the market complaint, the debts of Vitro's branches with their matrix would not have achieved the majority required to approve the re.
However, the possibility is recognised by Mexico laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are a half decade of examples, including Agremex and Mexico Commercial, whose intercompanying duties were estimated by the Federal Institute of Mercantiles Concurrences.
The truth is, too, that by remaining the votes of the branches, in all ways the Vitro creditors who fighted against this in the United States Courts, such as the "buitre" funds as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, they will not have achieved most.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The date is dismissed by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, this is Vitro's fault of the difficult situation that since 2008 has underlined the serious economic crisis that the United States has taken, taking the collections to the country.
The signature of the González Sada family will soon interfere with a review in front of the court of appropriations so that the vote reaches the full of this, namely the five judges, because only three votes were voted.
In this case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States will be claimed to make a review of the process by a higher instance.
The serious case is that the court submitted a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friends curiae ("friend of the Court"), in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Mercantiles Concurrence Act, indicating that it was declined with the conventions signed by both countries to empaque this with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankrotes Law.
Moreover, it is noted that the country was subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Commerce, namely the rules for transbording cases of inequity, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambol of two sides: Take Vitro and take it into the country.
General balance
During several months, the complaints placed on the table by the Mexican Aviation Syndicates against the exhibition of the company, Gaston Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, has already found the bottle bottle.
The instance held by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau Morineau has just submitted a penalty request against the National Bank Commission and the Values to which it is accused of obstruction to justice.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The baloncesto has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes' trotamunds was more than 60 years connected to the table cycle deport and, thanks to him, the whole world traveled.
Some people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local baloncesto as large as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a brain degree limited it to a road sail in 2008, the Reyes was in the deport for more than 60 years, he was player of small categories, player of the National Superior Baloncesto, a potential and leader in the BSN with the Bayamons Vaqueurs or president of the Baloncesto Federation.
"I put a lot of shadows in my life's balance, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general Manager of the National Team and Federative President for the 1990s," Reyes remembered during a first hour visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The balon is my life."
Reyes doesn't exhauste by doing that survival.
The walls of your house, almost all decorated with photos and memorandums that indicate their large traictory, so they attempted him.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, those increasingly feeling are those who memorize their step by the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as player until 1982, when he completed 15 years working as co-powered or pondered of the franquisy.
"These were my best years, the most I enjoyed because I had the opportunity to be part of eight campaigns of the Vaqueros since 1967, it was already as a potential, co-powered or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five campaigns running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I discouraged with one in 1981, the year of deputy of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.
The "Cuco" Ortiz was charged, which was a great administrator," Reyes indicated.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the Alabama University (Birmingham), said to me, "I have you a very strong player of 6"7" station.
Do you want it?"
And that was the principle of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended the Raymond Gausse francother, which was native and was one of our best trainers.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given him a campaign to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another.
The campaign of the Vaqueros with Gausse is gone, but already in the distance, because for 1988 it was already a federal mandate.
For that time, I prefered to enjoy their executionships and Mincy's in the National Team.
I remember when we wined the United States for the first time during the Preolympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World of 1990, where we arrived the fourth place, and it should have been bronce of not to be the Canadian arbitr who made us repeat the final game for the second time, said the Kings.
Is this world group in 1990 the best National Team you have seen?
It's among the best, as he won the Dream Team in the Olimpiades of 2004.
But my favorite was the of the Palestinians in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave him a pool to the United States team, which was very similar to who won the bronce in the world.
That team did not only repeat Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, which could not be in the 90th century because of a lease in the round.
A team that may not be the best in personal terms, but gave us a gold medalla and great joy was the Preolympic of 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner in the substitution of the players suspended by the Panamerican of the Sea of Plata, we win gold against all the proofs.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, that was Piculin Ortiz.
Its numbers at international turnees are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that without counting his traictory in the different links he played.
Who was the best bourgian leader?
That's very hard.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armmandito Torres.
From young people, I like Leo Arrill's job.
What do you think of your greatest achievement in the federalization?
It was part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90 BSN had up to 17 equipment at a season.
What's left you to do?
There were things that would have wanted to implement, such as regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce's kids were playing only in their area and only playing teams of other island springs in the national playoffs.
Now children are traveling and playing too unnecessary.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and arbiters.
That's a pleasure.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listening to music, see videos of my time music in YouTube, enjoy my grandfathers and sometimes go to balloon games.
And, of course, enjoying my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became worldwide aware of his central role as John Ross Ewing, most known as "J.R". in the "Dallas" series of television, in which he enhanced a man of unslave, malicious and manipulator business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the major oil deprecier J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" television series became a symbol of avariacy in the 1980 decade, died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year like J.R. at a new "Dallas" season, died on Wednesday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a communication of the family provided by the Warner Bros., "Dallas".
"Larry was in her dear Natal city of Dallas, representing again the iconic role he liked more," she said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the feritage of the Day of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted her wife's role in the original series and in the sequence, was with Hagman when she fell in a Dallas hospital, told her journalist Jeffrey Lane.
I was glad of all I knew.
It was creative, generous, funny, gracious, loving and talentful, and I will wonder it very much.
"He was a original person and lived the life at the maximum," Gray warned in a communication.
Hagman’s hectic cirrosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he found a bad tumor in the wheat and was subjected to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became awesome in television as a decent type in the "I Dream of Jeannie", distributed by the NBC string from 1965 to 1970.
In it it interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, a astronauta whose life is changed when he finds an attractive genio, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and leads her to live with him to her home.
It was also protagonist of two comedies that had little time at the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included well receiving papers in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was its magistrate interpretation of the encouraging hatable J.R. that led Hagman to its maximum star.
The dramatic series of CBS string on Ewing clan and other persons in its orbit was at the air of April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate a expectative in return to a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's personality is almost murdered, generated a international speculation and millions of dollars risked in appeal houses.
He also helped to give the series a audience record at that time.
When the answer was opened in a chapter of November 1980, a average of 41 million televisioners synthesized it and became "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment programme of the history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was J.R., Christin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. the embarrassment and then the threat with prostitute tacharla unless it was out of the city, but others had also reasons to attack him.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an inconscient corrupt with a charismical smile: a trampful businessman and a female husband who wanted her alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be internal.
"I know what I want in J.R." Hagman said in 1988.
I would say, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation he lost.
Main Victoria, coprotagonist of the original series, remembered the Wednesday to Hagman as someone "wonderful, inside and outside of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of wonderers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we had the happiness to know him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new and "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success to the TNT channel.
The five chapters had already been completed for the second season and one sixth was in process, reported the string.
There was no statement of Warner or TNT on how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
Fort Worth, Texas, was a son of the actriz and song Mary Martin, who starari ́ classic works such as "South" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage with a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He proved happiness in the theatre scenarios of New York at the beginning of the 1950 decade, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While he was there, she met the young design of Swedish Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrations live.
In 2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin": Tall (and absolutely true) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything there that I would think I'd hurt someone or affect them anyway," said Prince Associated at that time.
After heavy transplant, he became a promotor of the donation of organs and worked as voluntary in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I value them, I meet them when they come to their surgery, and then," she indicated in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like "no fear, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they'll be fine."
He was also active against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start the course that explodes the "The Fine of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic subjects such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and warmen, and global calamity.
This semester, when the teacher of the religious Stuart Charme decided to present a course on the end of the world, knew that he was counting with an irresistible injury: the end of the "large return account" of the Maya Calendar on 21 December, which has been affected by many people as a evidence of the end of the world.
But Charme had no idea of what he expected in the following few months: The Catholic Uracán Sandy, a fiscal precipient that some have called "dedurmagedion" and a growing conflict that involves Israel, the place where Christian theories at the end of the time believe that the Apocalipse will be started.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic seed that he had," Charme said this week to the students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If one analyses what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "the end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, the added professor Barry Vacker is presenting the course "Mediums, Culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic subjects such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and warmen, and global calamity.
"Let us consider why these ideas proliferate with time," he said, and how they offer hypothetic scenarios that lead certain human conduct.
If the nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, it could be a war.
This month students analysed films with apocalyptic subjects and explored how they were compared to examples of real life.
"I've tried to inform students about what is possible, Âe, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Re and its college Amara Solari, an attached professor of the Art History and Antropology, have made a team to provide a course, entitled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count with the option to present the course again, if the world doesn't end," said the Reague.
Despite the "inminent ruin", students should study, generate projects and take final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken in the viper of the Apocalipsis, which does not leave students more than working "to the same night that the world should end," said Re >
The courses were very popular.
"He was satured in two hours," said the King About his course for students with a high average, which was filled with 35 students.
We received messages by e-mail for weeks and weeks before the start of the seat, from people who asked if there was still happening.
Students, of their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I am fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Haddonfield carrier student, Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a question of comfort or the ausence of it.
Will Wekesa, a student of the psychology and nurse career, 25 years old, said that he had seen all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard about a class that could teach it," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no interviewed student - and much less a teacher - said to believe at the date of expiry of 21 December.
"Our first project discussed the May prophecy and somehow we decred it," said Julie Zeglen, a last year student in Temple, 21 years old and West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said King.
But he found that there is an apocalyptic concern in the west culture, which is remonted to several centuries, where people react to changes around them by preaching the end of the world.
Internet has caused a water of these speculations.
"In other ways people don't think about this," he said.
In most of the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a teacher of the University of the University, which provides courses in the Philippines this year, replied quickly to the question of whether he knew about some course about "the end of the world".
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he wrote, indicating a higher authority.
We have a Papa's indulge.
Re日 noted that during the years, the final judgment has been spoken of many days, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will begin to think immediately on the next date" or to philosopher that on 21 December it is the beginning of a period of seven years at the end of the world.
Students and teachers are taking the date easily.
Some said they thought to go to "the end of the world" festivals.
"Call me some friends to laugh together," Samira Ford, 20-year-old communicator, recommended.
