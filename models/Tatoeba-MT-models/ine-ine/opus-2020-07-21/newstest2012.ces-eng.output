Parliament did not support the new liberating Timoschenk
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused us to reject the new sentence of the sentence of paragraph, based on which the leadership of Julia Timochenkov's opposition was rejected.
The adjustment that would open the road to freeze the expremier, the Members refused when reading secondly to measure the penalties of economic offences.
In October, the Timošenk was sentenced to seven years of procedure to close a particularly inadequate with Russia on the purchase of land gas.
The judgment is not authorised, the revocation of the sentence shall be judged in the court.
The Timošenk refers to a sentence for a political position of the regime, the suspicion of the inquiry of the court has also been sentenced on the West.
We have supported the vote of 147 cases in order to fall out of the penalty law.
His approval needed 226 votes.
Libyan Victory
Libyan freedom, or Libyan Republic, has already been destroyed.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the wilderness and without war.
It's still to define the wins.
As in the country of advancing, in the elections of the islamic victory, it's about whether death or radical.
The Transitional National Council has been notified to the general law of Sharia and we have a certain view of it.
Libya's going to be a country without crime, because he's cut off his hand over the robe.
Women can forget emancipation, eventual disasters from faith waiting for recreation and likewise.
Instead of the dictator's person, the company of the associated staff will join the core.
In Libya, there will be a order that we can't imagine and which they've certainly not wanted.
Only because our way of life is not even the only, nor the objectively best, and most likely it would not be necessary to change the Libyans just mentioned.
In fact, it is wonderful that the Islamic Wars have taken a favor by using unbelieving dogs.
O’a’ta is the only thing that, from their view, the NATO’s general from America did not lead to the invasions, but Allah, whose size were glorified at each of the designed principles.
So when they are looking for winners in Libya, the west is not between them.
We participated in breakfast, served Islam, and our politicians dismissed a political association in the dictator's person, without guaranteeing such a profit.
After the pure bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq of Libya, we are not soldiers.
This fall falls locally with a problem with the exhaustion of cross-case.
But will they have without buying a farm company for a libyan black gold?
A lot of possible events and west will finally be able to enhance human rights protection.
So that will never command us the confessors of the Law of the Sherry.
It starts a new era of crisis.
France and the rest of Europe have been searched for investors
The statistical distress has passed through Europe into a deterioration.
The single states published data on the HDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated interquartally, Germany and France grow.
The long-term market, but today's the records.
The investors are no longer seen in Italy but also Spain, France, Russia and other.
The statistical authorities of the Euro, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published a preliminary review of economic development for the third quarter.
German HDP increased with 0.5% expected, France with 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better than expected (which was 0.3% in place of p.m. 0.1%), therefore France noted that it had occurred in a small reduction of 0.1% (the stagnation data were reported).
The Czech economy in the third quarter of the year increased by 1,5 per cent.
However, internally, the brutal household product (HDP) was stagnated and, according to the CSU, confirmed the trend of progressive reduction of the growth of economic performance.

The vineyards of Italian and Spanish debt grow to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel also Russia, Netherlands, France, Â ́s...
The vineyards in the 10-year-old 10-year-old debt are under 4%, even though the decrease in the region is worse.
From Germany it sounds that the ECB should be a believer of the last instance.
The Czech Republic was EURO.

He played a lot of fighting ball since the introduction minutes.
Both teams were only hardly involved in the combination and played around half lines.
The pressure of the housebalists, and therefore, has not come in the first half, a long payment for the defence, so the Czech defense was exactly rejected.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shot
A few hundred high schools made a living shot around the nuclear object in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country before the possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in the morning before the object and then caused the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students in the Iranian Isfahan university created a living shot around the Ishfahan nuclear center in which uran is processed.
It shows that they are ready to protect the nuclear programme from their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) concluded that Iran had not stopped to force nuclear weapons.
The potential attack on Iranian nuclear equipment is spoken in Israel.
Students prayed in the south before they entered the isfahanic nuclear object and then caused the death of America and Israel.
In the case of an attack that would be the most protected Iranian nuclear programme, it would be, in accordance with Israel’s printing other than the Isfahan center, also the equipment in Natan, in which uran is likely.
Baby's feedback: Not eating and dinner
More than the third of children in 9 to 13 years of age has problems with overweight, while the over-medium weight of 9 per cent of schoolers and the obligation is 5 per cent of children.
Instead, the obedient children are devoted to a family with a healthy lifetime, as she showed the current investigation.
It is revealed how important it is for healthy developments in which it grows and to which it is circumcised.
For example, at the tables of obedience children are discovered by a half more frequently than in the family of children with normal weight.
The remote game had a day before the research associated with a light action with the name of Obezita was not a result of more than 19 percent of the committees.
There is also no sporting habits in the families, but the family of today’s schoolers - only 15 percent of children answered that their parents would find time for active moves at least one week.
Review between 900 Children
The investigation followed at the end of the low school year, and 900 children from the basic schools from the whole Czech Republic were involved.
It was the second year-end of Obezita's action, not the event that supports the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
More than 12 thousand schools from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project.
The right feeding and the enough movement in the family is one of the specific factors that cause dramaticly deteriorating numbers of children with overweight or even obsessed.
"Only half of the questionnaires, for example, stated that it was five times daily in the schedule of dinner-sweet-sweekina, which is one of the basic conditions for the right survival," sounds one of the results of the investigation.
No breakfast and evening
The experts warn that for healthy development, there are also related details, including the regular time of family feeding.
In Czechland, at the same time, only 23 percent of school families are devoted.
In the majority of the family, everyone eats itself.
And the worst was to discover that in the tenth household, there is no food.
Saturday is based on the right day feed.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obliged children are more frequently consumed by injury games.
Almost every - unless weight - drinks sweet limonates every day (70 percent).
Although it regularly sports more than 40 percent of the kids concerned, their parents have been less than half - 15 percent.
Build your boyfriend.
Another part of the investigation enabled the selected child (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose from the offered options of their own eggs according to their own beauty and own view.
"The Training Preferences of the Czech Children in 12 to 15 years of age from the view of healthy survival far to the idea."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of mild, massive and sweet food.
"Alarming is, in particular, a great grass of sweet limonates," it states in the final message to investigate.
For dinner, as the main food, the testwins were stuck over the rocks.
But the practices of the children did not want the bullets, and they were low to fish and mid-ground foods.
Hypertension
The examination showed that children are willing to adapt their feeding advantages if they have the right information.
"In the control group of investigators, who fulfilled the questionnaire after the end of Obezita's light advice, there is no event, in many cases, a significant movement of preference towards the principles of healthy survival has been reported in the outcome project.
For example, it was marked in sweet limonates, where more children would start giving the preference to normal water.
Children also were more frequently stuck in the questionnaire of rocks and fish as the main food of day and would be limited to sweet foods and kidneys.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, a strong professional
In the introduction article about how the lists are learned, I had so little to realize that it was a lot in the introduction hours.
I didn't know what it would follow.
Three professors of the collection, clothing of problems and seminar about how it goes to place.
And it'll be worse.
As close to the final test, more information and practical tasks are waiting for us.
And even if the curse comes every Sunday and Sunday, it's actually "founded."
This time, we and the director of Allenka were gathered (in the course there is no only boy), how to dress a woman who has no perfect position.
And such is an overwhelming ability.
Someone has a short wheel, someone has a boyfriend's position without a regular crime, and someone's once again.
The stylist must think how optics to catch the wide rams, extend the wheel or add the needed wheels.
We got types like Jennifer Lopez's female, so the worst and the sides and the swimming past, I'll be nicely highlighted, and the woman is not too excitingly dressed.
For example, it is a division between the beach and the sides that the woods or the wallets are not actually sitting, and then payment is allowed to hide at least one of these cups of peace.
You'll be determined to blame because the perfect falling clothes are not payable.
You will feel much better in the cup of peace than in the one that continues to move you, fills up, remains in the pass and similarly.
The boy's position may be allowed to wear clothes with rows, emblems, heights, or building.
Such information and types of position are, of course, a lot, so I think I have all the week to make all the information in my head.
And I'm also afraid that because of the given home job, it's until.
Each of the cursists has received an added celebrity that is to make two outfity: day and evening.
We need to take into account the current view, the modality of the particularity and the type of position.
I'm gonna be clothing on Mirand Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit I'm sure, for me personally better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who lastly took a hundred kilo (see, please, in the coast), or a young Selena Gomez.
We need to stick out of the magazines or search on the Internet and print and follow graphical processes.
Moodboard, as it's called the whole output, then it's our personal and our relationship with the graphical creation.
Think of the graphical page is also important.
The style does not only dress physically, but also creates such product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, such as cabs trends, cabs apod.).
That's what the artist told us and the master Mario Kamenic.
But it's the weekend.
List of styles must have a general review
The Sabbath offers of information about the types of positions have immediately been released by three hosts from the office.
Stylelist Honza Poor, Moderal Charter of Jacob Polanka and Modern Photograph Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that the mode is illusion and the architect should be able to use it.
And the chicken list can work with one cup of clothing differently.
The variable is key in this case.
So you may have such a minute (or if you want plyly trenchcoat) can be wearing classics through the jungle and trick as a flat, but you can even dress it on a hot body, clothing the boats and photographing as clothes.
Or it's enough to get the hands or the limbs and the whole look looks right now.
"Play with it," he highlighted.
But mostly, I evaluated the following advice, "You're perfectly familiar with the rules for work."
"So you can start to hurt them," said Jacob.
I'm finally aware of why we're losing all the lessons that I'm combining with, why, when we see something else in the modern lackdy magazines.
I don't even talk about watch.
Thanks to the photographer of Ben, I know again that the list must have a much more variety of clothing than how much they go.
So in the fashion story, which will have ten pages (and ten outfits), I have to be ready to "continue" at least fifty.
And it also looks like the clothing and works in combination with other leckdy cuts totally different than in the ability.
So we have to calculate when creating outfit.
That the image and ́s doing leckdy to half success, Honza Point confirmed us.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which is not just a wonderful song, but image and marketing from her made a world old.
In Czechland, the access to the use of services is more cold.
Even the known faces of the leckdy think it's unfair (but I know something, how I look like it is otherwise).
And if someone of us already lets creating, then we have to count that with great probability, he gives us a totally different (small) size than he really has.
Then it's not left to go and discover if the bullwar wrote about that the given celebrity was stuck/shubla and similar.
Honza and Mario were putting our heart on Sunday that the lists would not be able to guide themselves in the mode and to make outfit.
In his work, he communicates with people who are clothing, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
It's worth bearing people, not inclining, standing in your mind.
"When a manager is able to stumble her and fill her with a nice cup, you can't cut her out the whole box and say, "Good, it's a fear."
"Find at least a few things you appreciate and recommend what you can wear," said Mario.
He also showed us specifically what everything must contain such a "plaquet" or a piece of place.
It's the one you're switching around the pass and you have all your properties.
Besides the materials such as the neck, the war on the rubbers or the locks, there are also silon nit (the list helps to focus products such as cabs or cloucos), special clips with which we get back of the clothes if it is more (shangling or other charges are not allowed, would be destroyed by clothes), or a cup.
And they were not only listening, but they also tried something practically, we learned how to fit the bottles correctly.
Even when you focus in the atelier, where the surface is equal, the cup could hurt, so outside.
So we were nice and nice.
We are not able to touch us, nor to touch us, so that they don't hurt.
So there is a need for true soundness.
Mario rejoiced me when my creation was grateful without exemption.
It's not really my friend.
This is just a little break of what we heard about the second weekend continuation of the course.
It's starting to be more than to do that to do with the professional level of reality, it's not a prosecution of the raw garden, let anyone say what he wants.
In Need for Speed: The facility is invoked throughout the entire America.
Reviews
P's anxiety driving for a series of unrealistic ladding errors changes into the rutine rainway to the thickness.
Although the ambice has been able to fill in a significant measure, it's not worth anything if no one was obviously wanted to do anything more.
The new part with the subtitle The awake before issue of a high expectation.
He promised that the Need for Speed's flying series would move a bowl again in a new direction and from a playable show it appeared as a game that would not have to be just to the number in the genre of action.
We were also aware of the input passports in which the main horse will come out of the car and walk after its own.
But as the NFS series has been a habit, many are a little different in the outcome than we expected.
They are potentially obedient arcade conveyments, but the whole goes down a number of undesirable errors that occur in the series at least a few years.
So it's not even a mistake, but it's more like an incomprehensible degree of developers.
Goodness begins very well.
You are mentioned in the story whose main herd Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered in illegal divorce throughout America.
As a volunteer, you are sitting at the western village in San Francisco and your task is to take it first to New York.
It's a lot of interesting elements with you.
The trace is divided in ten steps, and then on more than fifty divisions.
It shows that every trail is going to other steps and that the stages are based on different, sufficiently different and interesting stages.
The man doesn't even feel that the game would still offer the same.
Moreover, some of the §s are very beautiful to view, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So that's nothing worldwide.
But the road throughout the wilderness, the sub-term country or high in the snow mountains acts visiblely very pleasant.
Moreover, the injuries have been repeated with a non-typical element from time.
For example, in the wilderness, you are getting into a sung storm that decreases the visibility.
In contrast, in the mountains, you need to give attention to you so that you don't have a lawyer.
In addition to that, they're very well seen by individual divorce.
There's just a few types of them, but it's enough.
You are trying to take a requested group of companions (in the basic classic case), then you get time again (classic fight with steps) and then you need to wait for a single cohesion.
You're still coming to the police that continues to disappoint your efforts from time to time.
The news are passports outside the car.
It's just about such interactive animation when Jack's faces some hooks and you need to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
But it surprises that these passports are much less than you would wait (only even three).
But in the outcome it is for the benefit of the thing, because this element does not have the possibility to become angry, and in the context of the above words, it is so related to elements that the game rises.
Eastern model is in the stages of the previous parts.
That means that it's no longer anybody today, but it's not saying that it's a challenge.
You're looking for realistic simulation, you'll have to look around.
But the more fairly comprehensive leading now is still a very good model, although the competition has been able to find better.
So all of it's fine.
But the problems begin to appear at the same time.
In the case of the model of the cheese, it's not a cool model.
From the game of this type we don't expect to calculate the complex deformation and colise, but if practices before any move to any object you don't have the least idea how your car is stored, then it's probably not all right.
Typicals at the fast prejudice or exchange of cars in the running operation sometimes you are just lightly oiling each other, but in other cases, the identity will end your car in wild pirates.
Or even the same attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it's not especially worried, but it's going to get you out.
Restarts are resolved so that if you're divorced or gone far out of the trace, you're running the game from the game to the last wonderful point on the trace.
But the restarters are available only five in each district.
If you're clear, you've got to start again from the beginning.
So it's more like a help for the case that something will be done than you can expressly listen to them.
Sometimes, though, even restarts can't help, they will resolve until the need to learn the degree of the conviction to remember.
A big crazy game is that the same things are often in the same places.
For example, some trailers, for example, need a project in a specific way, Otherwise you will not go into them shortly.
Sometimes you will meet the "civil" vehicles in the same configuration if you come there first, five, five seconds ago, or in a minute later.
It is especially in the events when you see between the two anti-leaving cars will be easily passed before you, while when you come there, there are vehicles in a position that you have to run or accelerate them.
It's one time you're coming to them because it's "numbered" so that it's going to the data -- exactly before your nose.
Countries have more benefits.
During the entire time, you're going to go to a few places where you, without a view to the time, will be the same cohesion in the same place.
Moreover, it ends the game on a long pool where you go in the opposite.
The opposite there before you may have to be enough for any price.
When he goes before you, he's deteriorating the preview of the anti-equipment vehicles, so you're about a few times in the beginning.
It is to understand the purpose of make the game more abusive and adrenalina, but the performance is so obvious that it will eventually lose you.
And it's damage, because although a simple cheese model is playing funny and places and so much action that sometimes you're not trying to see where it goes.
And it's in principle one thing if it's a concept of fifty-unicotic traces, a rational discipline, that it doesn't have any chance or anything else.
The non-radical idea is the exchange of cars during travellers.
You have to take care of the benzin pumps at the road because you can just change the car, although in total cases you'll get enough with what you're right.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Companys are suitable to towns, strong American bathrooms at equal distances and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example by clicking mountain roads.
With the main history mode, the hands are in hands and outcome modes, which are divisions in individual locations you know from the history.
Here you get not only medails but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and stories.
To obtain higher level of drivers, different objects are lost: starting cars and finishing backgrounds for profile.
This is, at the same time, again connected with the Autolog online, which, otherwise, compares your achieved results to other players and provides further communities.
One of the other hard-intelligible springs is the last deal in history.
With your car, you will get into the tunnel of metro, where you marry it in darkness after the order.
The numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (bye) are drawn to you in the tachometer, and in the back of the construction of the meter, and you are uncomfortable.
In the editor, we may still have a few days to discuss whether when playing a game, no one really thinks, or whether the authors have us to do so much stupid.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the total overview is very pleasant in cases, and in some cases even great.
He's lost so that in some more drinking moments, it's a lot of tragic pictures, and in some cases.
But it's in particular a puzzle with a larger number of photographers when you're not going to be worth any more.
The sound page is okay and soundtrack is a question of whisper.
In trying to enjoy what is the widest scale more than the younger public raised soundtrack from the category "Every dog another wheat", but it is supposed that because of listening to music games, it is likely that somebody can buy it.
Total income from Need for Speed: The face is so significantly discouraged.
And the game would have caused completely unfair mistakes, then they would not be afraid to say that the best part of the NFS is in the past few years.
That's what the game is doing unfairly.
It's probably good, but prepare for the mistakes that you'll be in the eyes of the power of aeroplane reflectors.

Excellently at EU Vicen:
Czech Republic has the story of negativists and euroscapes
"Lisboa's complaint has expressly rejected the equality between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect that it would be such a strong war."
"It will take five, six years before the playing is a little slow, calm and all players will grow on their new role," began his mother's advice to the Practice Faculty Czech highlights at the European Union Milena Vicen.
As its motto "Intelligent and openly on Europe" is serious, it has already shown in the first part of the presentation when it has been able to describe the individual EU authorities and their relationships in such a transparent and comprehensive way that a number of transferred from the UK Privacy Faculty could be determined.
Vicena also thanked the work of the new continuous President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuye:
"Now the criticism appeared that it's unexpected that it's a nice officer that he can't fill any role, and I have to say that he's expressed a spirit to everyone that the role has been excited greatly."
"It is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them and has a view where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Employment and Security Policy explained as an answer to the question: "Who is this European Union? What phone number I have to call?", so as a significant step to join and more readable Union policy against States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit us of the powder
The vice versus the agency of the European Council lives and will live at the closest time.
The preliminary Czech Presidency was a success.
The Czech Republic resolved the following financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or organized summits for the Eastern Partnership.
The Government then signed as a great negative degree that the Czech Republic was very harmful.
The Czech Employment in the EU is currently very strong.
The words of "fact frmol" were not only the presidency but also the next financial crisis, which is currently resolved today.
Moreover, the new seventh year budget of the Union must be approved, which is significantly complicated because of the current economic facility.
Should it be budgeted by a scarce and harmful, which the sector will receive the privileges that the countries will be supported more and less, it is all in the order of the next negotiations.
She also remembered its main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "The Europe is comprehensive."
"I really don't have a hurtful shortcut, a strange word, a handicap that nobody understands.
How the citizen has to understand that reality doesn't mean crossed or cut buckets, bananas differently big or that someone really needs to prohibit us of powder."
He also wants to use the EU better and get more Czech to European institutions.
We're waiting for more Europe
According to the highlights, the Czech Republic has the story of euroscapes and people who have more negative than positive sides of the matter.
Moreover, it hates the low income of the Czech in European institutions.
There are factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech Republic.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Fourth.
"Peace me, when Polack and Hungar come after me and come near Slovak, then the French will say to me, "Hey, what are you going to meet, what is your Visegrad's fourth?" and it doesn't be overwhelming."
In the future of the Union, according to the Vicena, they are primarily expecting new rules for the budgetary policy of the Member States.
As a very real concept, it has a double concept, unless more Europe is, more than the new "European Federation".
"We have the euro country and the euro country outside the euro."
"We've got the Schengen Chamber, we've already had an institution of strengthened cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that they should cooperate only with the lands they want and those who do not want to stand up."
"The institutions will be more and it will be a two-year Europe," expects Vicen.
In this regard, it also evaluated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in the procedure of the principle, in which all the subjects affecting the whole Union have been negotiated between all Member States, not only among the euro countries.
History Brand:
IBM Innovator starts its existence in the second century
If anyone looks for a word that the IBM strategy is most clear, it would like to be "long quality".
For the wide public, IBM is the symbol of the Revolution, it is the company that is very modern, and yet has been a hundred years since it has been arrested.
The foundation of this holding placed the first boss of the company, Victoria Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already dealt with the password that a number of world problems can be easily resolved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became a printing around the future gigant life (and also the name of the internal magazine, which has started to run in 1935 in IBM).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built fire culture.
"For us from IBM means continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered hundred years because she remained aware of its basic values, and then she did not be afraid to change all the ends around herself.
This allowed us to transform the business, business, and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second hundred we can achieve more," said Samuel J. Palmisano's annual director of the company.
Promoted system
Watson was accessed to care for his employees as the employer of Baťa in Czechland - people from IBM had as one of the first American employees allowed, a guarantee from employee plus an elegant employee uniform and a worked system for the reward of best finders and businessmen.
It also has the IBM's ability and its relationship with the client.
The community was genial from the beginning of the trial of talents - as one of the first world fires canceled any discrimination, so she could choose.
In accordance with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisan in the head of IBM represents women - Virginia Rometty in the next year.
The IBM has already been working for thirty years, still remains the position of the boss of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years makes such an online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations are developed.
It's not surprised that ideas are enough - it works almost half a million people in the company.
Institute with a good name
A strong position in business provides the company with its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had more concept of institution than only the company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a company, but a company that helps to solve business problems for use," added George Colony from the Forrester Research final company.
As the company itself says, it is the difference between incoming on the market and the market to create equally.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it has been overleaving for its log in the United States - has grown up in one of the largest four years of the world.
It is obviously the most universal company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and containing services in the product scale from servers after nano.
He holds the most patents of all American fires and the five of her employees gained Nobel's price.
Its findings belong to the requirement of bankomate, payment card, financial swap, chart code or diskette.
The IBM has become the second largest company of the market capitalisation (a.k.a. Apple), when Microsoft was first presented since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations have been treated in the customers and times - for example, IBM has not been able to get the OS/2 own operational system, the Prodigy online service or IBM computers.
"When your business is placed on a move forward, you can't be emotional to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM doesn't have a problem to build its bases on many platforms - and if they don't work, let them go.
To the section of the Competitive Microsoft, which is in principle standing and falling on the Windows operating system.
Perspective
On IBM markets, the biggest share of services, after five is created software and hardware.
On the other hand, in 1990, he was more than half of the strongest representative of the hardware.
Since 2000, IBM sold a small amount of 15 billion dollars, it also invested $58 billion in the purchasing of perspectives.
In investments it has also continued since 2008, when the first world has overcome a new financial crisis.
IBM, according to the reference of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the amount of investment during the large economic crisis.
It seems that the IBM company is going through the current crisis.
The price of IBM action since the beginning of 2008 was estimated by 120 percent of rackets, the pure winning of the company continued to grow.
The IBM Fire Password is to change everything, only its values are not.
Therefore, it can be expected that although another crisis comes, this flexible gigant will be able to make it possible.
History IBM: From the swimming screen after the year to the universe
The IBM company (International Business Machines) appeared in New York a hundred years ago, had a complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name of the IBM took up until 1924 - a sign was used for the campaigns in Canada and South America.
Based on the greater IBM, the fourth footsteps of the history of the ninety-years of the nineteen.
They owned it as if it were the "speaks", then the hours of the employee's income and department.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint business, who also presided the supervisory Council in 1930.
Flint took the boss of Thomas J. Watson's competitive company to help him with the management of the company.
The leader then shaded the IBM founder - on Watson's thoughts has now been set up an inconsistent fire culture and identity.
Watson led the company up to 1952.
IBM, as stated by her name, started with the production and sale of all possible business machines - from the creamers of meat and sugar after powder.
During the first four years that Watson was headed, he doubled up to nine million dollars and started a large extent of the company to all the world.
Watson was so scared for the company that almost 40 years after his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leading IBM began to work on the development of artistic intellectuals, developed the first programming language.
In the sixty years, people and computers from IBM helped NASA drive years to the universe - to Merkur, Saturn, and in 1969 a slave year of man for month.
Meanwhile in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - a series of IBM System/360.
The classic "speak", which set up the computer standard of that period, with the name of IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
For twenty years ago, IBM sold the production of Chinese computers to Lenovo, however, buying a constant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to complete advice and services with a highly added value.
It is the concept of Smarter Planet, "the smarter planet".
Its goal is a wise use of the §s, such as non-planned ability and improvement in the transport or management of cities.
For trade, it has recently introduced the IBM platform "Smarter Commerce", which helps trade operators to conduct the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong story in the foreign.
She has already found her debt in Czech Republic in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, other than IBM CHR is also operating a strategy outsourcing center in Brna.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and is also a world-level research team with the recognition of the vote.
Unbelievable husband-in-law:
Iveto, let the egg go, I don't want it anymore!
Darin Richterary (53) said the end!
After his wife Joseph Richter (53), Ivety Bartosh (45), but also a loving man, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the red dream and return home.
But now, waiting for an incompatible and setting rules in the next life.
"Papa can come home, but not as my partner," explained the Richterary.
When Darina Richariah was spent Bartosh’s azyl in her house, she obviously didn’t seem to be the end of her marriage.
Although Iveta was moved from Greek after 30 days, Pepa didn't leave the song.
He even acknowledged publicly that she loved her.
During the time, Darin rejected her husband’s relationship, and now she gave him forever good.
The Richtain doesn't care with who his wife's sleeping
If the Richter with Bartosh just once had gone, the woman's hands were open to her home to wait there.
"It's a biological father of my sons, and if he wants to get his life in our common house, no one's going to get it out."
"Now, he lives not as my dear, bloomed old axe, but as a man with which I have certain relationships," the Watchtower assured that she has already responded to her husband and is only to be obedient to each other.
Joseph's being locked by Darin's back door, he's not still worried.
"I respect your wife's agreement."
"I'll be with Iveta and I'm not going to change it."
"The husband continued the paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I'm looking for realities, garden, immunity, buying."
"Darina and I are totally normal, just as we don't share a lie together," said the Blesk Richter.
If she also found her new love, where she would protect her in it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care about where he goes with who he's going and if he's a friend.
I know that it's my fault, I loved Ivety and I'll be responsibility for myself," Joseph closed.
The worst women's crimes: are you too?
When you ask men if they could call such typical female crimes, all of them in one is very ready to get out of the hand.
Honey women, do you know in the following lines, where are mentioned a few women's crimes that can finally be able to men to broke blood in the jail?
Buying
Do you calculate your second half that you're dependent on the purchase?
Do you have to buy at least one hole a week?
Are you buying a hot and hot in the ships?
Then, in your case, you can talk about purchasing as a crime.
Some women realize that they should have their purchases at least a little.
But tell me who would just take it in business with clothing, look for good falling objects and then try them all (deeply in different color performances) in the cabinet?
Although for a woman's purchasing a kitchen, husbands can be a letter of ready peak.
Just remember how many times you've said to yours that she's waiting for you before incoming...
Inconsistent Inconscience
"I'm not too tired?"
"I'd have to lose at least five pounds - I should start practicing?"
"I love you all?"
Didn't you like these things to do anything?
Isn't it?
Then you belong to those women who are stumbled by the way they look.
Not that you should stop being concerned about yourself, but men are alergic to how their partners continue to look forward to their views.
The stronger generation is also agreed with what the frequency of this complication increases, the women are more cruel.
Order and cleanness in the first place
It's like an unusual shot.
He's missing windows, swimming, spraying the wheel, pulling the drop of the vany - and at least two times a week.
Do you calculate the partner that he's thrown his leg on a pure garment, the kid that they've spent the wall of the wall and that you've given so much work with?
If you're just suffering this "cool", you're trying to realize that nothing's to be overcome, and the order and cleanness should not be in the first place of the family.
This unfair desire after cleanness can threaten your mutual relationships and family deal.
Scrolling
"Their useful trainers go into the waste."
"You're going to get the old legs on yourself tomorrow?"
"The powerful struggle doesn't belong to the ground."
If your partner gets such a shot a few times a day, you know that you'll be able to make it easily.
Of course, you don't think it's wrong, you want to get it all right.
Maybe if the men imagine that women wouldn't want to get so much into them...
Speaking, disorder
For some women, there are also their own conversations, battles, but also the rape and association against someone.
Women are focused on relations, and so together they gather things of the type who, where, with who, who and why.
I guess everyone of us will leave a little worm or a clothet here.
The hand on the heart, it's probably your own women.
On the other hand, they are the weaknesses of the most cruel one that they are and often doing, they may be everyone in the surroundings and are for their environments - mainly in the work collective of women - especially dangerous.
Jagr and Voraček helped assistants to play Philadelowe
The Hokey attacker Jaromir Jagr shared in the Monday trip NHL two assistants in Philadel·e 5:3 in Carolina’s railway and is again in the main productivity of the Czech players in competition.
From the review of the ninety-year stars, Giroux was weakened in both cases, which added another player and was announced to the best guard player.
Two assistants in the shipmenal and Jagro's collaborator Jakub Voraček.
The Jagr after the sea journalists arrived, stated that Giroux had predicted a big evening.
"I told him that he's getting hacked."
"I felt it."
"Speaks this feeling will overcome you," Jagr explained, after which Giroux gave the action from the first arrow of Flyers.
The second principle of the team was a cheese stop for a moment.
The cockpit shot for the Hurricanes kitchen and presented it between the circles of Maxa Talbot.
A second before the first break was decreased in a weak home player Patrick Dwyer, but the second part of it was Flyers again.
Specificly to Giroux.
After cooperating with Jagrem, he shot the third, then his shooter moved to the fourth Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the lisa, but it's certainly between the best three," assessed Jagr's center.
"I'd never believe that at the end of my career I'll play with a hokeit like him."
"I'm glad of it."
"I want to play on him."
"All those years in NHL my partners have tried to play on me, now it turns," added Jagr.
Carolina still made a drama, Tuoma Rutua, and Duyer, who was sent down from a criminal shot, got to the section of one.
Another complication but did not allow Matt Read, who was reading to read two to one.
"He's probably put in our Pronger's box."
"He's thrown out the cup, I've got the rubber and (Read) went to the remote road."
"I tried to embrace him, and I'm sure that it was," he described the last record of his view of Voraček.
Philadel's winning got into the head of the Eagle.
The Czech defenseur of Montreal Jaroslav Spaček did not get a fight against Buffala, and the third was delayed for the damage in the top of the body.
Candians, near the tested beach, were also lost two-brake leaders and lost after the penalt dilution 2:3.
One of them hasn't changed Tomas Plekanec.
More than the lost points of the home trainer hated the row of the row of the back, while the ships were only on five wallets.
"It's bad."
"We've been playing with only one experienced player, the rest of the youths."
"But there's nothing to do with this quickly, we have to do with it," said Jacques Martin.
"What's wrong with us, and we couldn't get away."
"We should have simplified more the game, moving the puck out of our bed."
We had the borders in it," added one of the P. K. Subban sellers.
The Czech Officer André Pavel accompanied thirty sticks of Winnipeg to play 5:2 above Tampou Bay.
The Jets, who canceled the five-passed serial of the trailer, shared five different shooters.
How the interest prices were developed since 1989
In 1989, only five State travel officers were allowed in the Czech Republic of Czech, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The road of offices at that time sold only the interests to the country of the socialist block because the traveling to the west was very careful.
The Czech tourists thus traveled to the sea to the NDR (Democracy Republic of Germany), to the Soviet Union (Soci in the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A large exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Jugoslavia, but the Yugoslavia regime was appealed to the West, and the roads of the Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were therefore very distorted.
The great paradox of socialism was that the citizens of the social stage block (e.g. the Czech Slovakians) were not allowed individually to travel freely or in the socialist countries.
If the Czech Republic wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed a letter from this country, otherwise the individual path was not possible.
The road of offices at that time also offered interests to the West, but it was necessary to set a front over the night with a spackake or to have a "known" office on the road.
However, it wasn't won.
For example, the devise promise, which was a submination for the road to the West, was not made "politicals to the unfair people" who could so not be tried at all.
However, the Czech Republic was not freely changing currency, and without a devise promise, it was not possible to obtain financial (western currency) to the West.
However, most often, the Czechs traveled in the foreign, whereas the result was a large number of chat and chalup, which the Czechs had bound, and this habit survived today.
The traveling of the Czechs has thus lived in the revolution since 1989.
While in 1989 it was allowed to be our maximum in NDR or Bulgaria, Czech wheels were spent in 4,5 billion allowed in the countries of the whole world.
The huge paradox that we do not understand today is that we were not able to travel freely for us at the most age of Croatia until 1989, since it was part of that Yugoslavia.
Soon in the past 90th century, the visibility of the Neighbourhood European countries was decreased, which restarted a major wave of short-term visits, especially in the Russian Poland or Germany.
The Czech speakers couldn't be able to get out of the west, at least everyone wanted to look at the châa.
For example, in Paris, the Church's interests were burned in couples in rooms because our timely receipts were not allowed, and they could pay hotels or pens.
The typical trip of the Czech traveling was at this time the carriage of their own food, conserve, rooms around to be saved.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely changing Czech crowns, which our tourists finally could buy a west currency after many decimal years.
However, our live levels and the average payments were decreased, which developed around 1997 at another important time.
Increased requests after traveling have started the road of offices regularly since 1997 to prepare charter airlines interests, with which air interests have been able to make us a lot of sleeves compared to the past incrediblely malicious.
At the end of the 1990 ’ s, the Czech Republic had already had an invisible practice to all developing countries of the world, other than the United States, which has further facilitated our traveling.
Another interesting moment in the history of the involving travel came immediately in 2000, when a significant request was made from the Czech Republic of the history the first direct charter year to exotic, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, the air winter will fly directly from the CR to twelve exotic destinations with the Czech tourists.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100 thousand Czech every year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our evolution development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States dismissed the vision of the Czech tourists, and our country was definitively organized between the most developing country of the world.
In 2008, the Czech first in the history was acquired of more than half of their allowed in the ship (50.3%) and first in the history lost one of the expenses allowed for more than 15.000 in the place of residence.
Valna homada has to find the president, but it's dangerous even.
Nearly five months the Czech Bal is without the president and is threatened that Ivan Haška, in the head of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), knows even after another extraordinary valley hole, which will be performed on Thursday in Nymburce.
However, there is still no agreement on which election rule will be made.
Without her, it doesn't begin to vote on what three candidates will be chosen.
I'm interested in carrying the Czech Chamber of May Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelt and Tomás.
Hashek resorted to the rubber in June, and when he left, he invited colleagues to join and find a strong person that would lead to the future.
But in the years after Haskovi, the Balbal returned to the roofs between both bones, which cannot be agreed on the joint candidate.
It was completely shown on September 16 when the new president had to be chosen.
Delegates of Value of Worms are insufficiently in the National House of Prague in Smich Chale, because the negotiation remained locked and was only on the way of choice.
However, there was no agreement with who has the right to vote in fact - whether only the statutory representatives, or even the authors of the confirmation are full of power.
In this single point, a part of the agreement has occurred since that time, to which the recommendation of the State establishment and the right to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
But the poor are still governing the electoral order.
It has not brought too much to the executive committee, which has already been on its negotiations, whether or not too worthwhile or exceptional, in principle, does not solve anything else.
The view of the option of choice has changed sometimes, but the neuralgy point is still the same.
A question sounds: how to go in the 3th round to disrupt the possibility of patrol?
"The speech is whether to act in accordance with the provisions or to find another model," said one of the three presidents of the FAČR Dušan Freebod, who represents a professional ball in the management of the association.
According to the provisions of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate will win the more percentage of the support in the cell, which is not candidate.
Morava is evidently willing to go to the approach to win a candidate, which will increase the percentage of votes with both comor.
And the Czech party claims the submin that the winning must receive at least two-third overviews in this percentage calculation.
"Unless it would have left the meaning of the two previous rounds, it would have completely overcome the two-comor concept," it understands the married side of the Liberty, which would be the best order to avoid and choose according to the valid sets.
Thus, it is a surprise to be agreed to Tomás, although it is considered that the electoral order is designed mostly from all candidates to Pelt.
"I'm supposed to vote at the maximum according to the order."
"To do not mean any major misunderstandings like the past wall walls," said Major Victorie Plzeň, who first candidates and in his exhibitions, especially against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimist.
In Nymburce, the new president will be known, and the candidates will cooperate together in the future.
"All of you will be quiet in the case of today's National Team Measurement of Europe."
"Fotball will be again on a happy wheel, will be more willing to cooperate," a minimum model factor, who has three of the greatest experience with the management of the ball and at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more sustainable.
"I hope in the agreement, but, despite all, it's very disappointed."
"It's not between people from Czech and Moravia, but there's efforts to adapt the rules."
"It can cause the blocking of the wallets again."
"But I hope he will win a healthy understanding," said Rajchl.
It's not a long time for the agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations should have been reported directly in the Black Mountain, as anyone knows whether the Balance Generality will be complete.
The airport specialist in which they had to travel to the Podgorice, outside the other presidential Dalibor Kuchera and Rajchl, was not flying from Prague for technical mistakes and looking for replacement variants as part of the Executive Committee to the bargage transport.
Finally, there may be a decision-making meeting at the Ministry level to which it can reach data in the middle.
Ministry of School, Young and Body Ministry Joseph Dobesh would have accepted different parties within the most powerful sports in the country to agree.
It is a lot in the game: State dotation, confidentiality of Bala, and also a Valid CSTV hop, which will solve a new consequence of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
He's going to fight the president because he doesn't see the appropriate candidate
If the boss of the Balists Plzne Tomás had seen a strong candidate before a strange valley, which would comply with all his ideas about the new President of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic (FACHR), he would not have been noted in the fight against the top of the Czech Republic.
"When the quality addept exists, I'm fighting for and I'm not going to choose."
"But for the present ability, no one could find such," said the CTK.
In the fight with Miroslave Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl, a woman's motivation to just try to prevent Pelt, a given favorite choice, in the way to the FAČR head.
The record also highlights that in the case of his victory, it would only be held in the role of the President until 2013 when the programme is a strict Value.
In the vibration, it would have seen a experimented and spike manager, which is not too connected with the ball action.
"I've spoken with some people who would be in mind."
"For me, it was crazy when some say that they don't want to identify the Czech Bal at this point."
"That's what I'd like to change," he said.
Now, from all the most of them, Peltovo's connection to the President of the Plzeni National Union of Roman Berbrem, a man with a controversial story, who is known in conculicy as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates on the Valley Room.
It's so unacceptable for the chairman that Pelta's standing in the presidential position.
"If he wins, the current state is reserved and nothing would be moved before."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a powerful businessman, it wouldn't work more," said the student.
It also claims that Pelt's name has been sentenced in the investigation of corruption affairs, but from which Pelta has come out without sin.
"I don't know how pretty Pelt's victory would be."
"And as they looked also in the eyes of EUFA and FIFA," said the architect, who, however, also takes into consideration his opinion that he would "sell a pulmonary club if Pelta became a president."
In the case of a triumph in the quarter election, however, he would have been able to represent the future cooperation with Pelta.
It also considers another candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by the chairman before the severe valley cromado, which ended fiaski.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd follow."
"He has great ability."
"I could imagine him as a boss of representation."
"But the manager wouldn't be able to drive partners."
"I don't even stumble the nose where I don't know it," said the guy who raised a great attention in September, standing after the Commission of decision-making in the head of the Human Macel, who replaced Dagmar Damk.
The writer says he'd be aware of the leading of the association.
It is revoked to its ability from the management of private fires, also leading the Plzni since last year, which, with its support in May, celebrated the primary liver triumph.
"I have the power to change something in the Balls, to contribute to his certain culture."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups that may have the tendency to influence the disciplinary and revocation committee, which goes to insults," said a chairman who does not have their antipaties, for example, to the Spanish boss Daniel Christian.
One of the priorities would also consider the FACHR relationships with the Czech Olympy Committee, with which it would be helped by political spices to gain more money from lottery tax in sport.
"It's one of the key things that the new president should be presented."
"If it comes to the risks of political parties, I understand their arguments, but at the same time they have to say where money will go," he noted.
As a moment, it doesn't receive its association with the pulsed club, so it himself states that the President FAČR should be "oversided".
The Pelta is connected again to Jamal, Rajchl with the Prague Duklo.
"It's not ideal."
"I don't even see the meaning of translating my action to someone's club, and for a year and a half, he returned there," he said.
Pelta promised new FAČR provisions that would eliminate election pats
Two days before the Valley Cromadobal Association of One of the candidates to President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the case of the choice, the FAČR would have new provisions that would definitively distort the election line in the future.
The modelic ionionist is optimist before the quarter negotiation in Nymburce and makes it clear that the preferential fight will expose the event of today's success of the Balance Representative.
Pelta has already promised that just on representation and receipt of funds should be concentrated in the case of choice.
In the choice before the past wall cromado, he decided to go for the last minute, so a two-month department could be able to deal with his ideas of the Balbal management and to present in a larger context.
"The people at all levels are doing a lot of balls and expecting the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it's the highest time to be able to be associated with someone," my man, which is primarily connected to the Japland club, but who has been acting in Sparta for a number of years and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That is why it thinks he has enough experience to be able to conduct the Czech Bal.
It is convinced that, for the current choice problems, the Eufory was governed in the days of the Government of Ivan Haška.
"But, on the red wall walls, they were approved, which were not as perfect as they all thought."
"When different explanations were not made, we had the President since September," he advised Pelt.
The processing of the most important document of the citizen association took place as a delegate.
"When I'm chairman, I'll take it as a personal task and I'm willing to take a personal responsibility if it doesn't happen."
"It's the principle we can't be without," says Pelta.
He's still trying not to stand against his companions.
He already warned that he could present cooperation with Jindrich Rajch, who recognises for his legal education, and he knows well that his anti-candidate would be his first president.
He didn't have a long attack on the Tomase, who did not leave any sugar on Pelt.
"The battle moves something over a year, gets the same success."
"But his attacks were inappropriate, and a lot of people in the way of the electoral campaign."
"And this is why a number of them now doubt about his character," he said against the Pelta address, which is probably remaining a warm proclaimment that he has already announced in September.
His strongest weapons are, according to the knowledge of the lowest competitions to the representation.
This should be the exhaustive box of Balbal.
"And I would also try to finish all the affairs begins with the Bohemians cousin or the songs of the low corruption scandal."
"I'd soon go to negotiation with the private and state sector and we've provided enough money for the whole bal," said the CTK sixty-year candidate two months ago.
Then he also promised that his arrival to the head of the Bala would not mean any personal purchase.
"I should first meet with the full of individual employees," he said to the fear, where a comprehensive nerve is from long uncontrollation.
During the present disaster scenarios that run away from a valve hole, the delegates will not go on Thursday in Nimburk unfortunately.
"When the only contrary point is how it will be called in the third round, we can be able to move through it."
"Fotball Âe confidence, and there only gets it will finally have his leader again," Pelta remains two days before the possible day that decides his career with optimism.
Rajchl promises that the FACHR would start working firmly under it
The new president of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic on the quarter Valley Room would be chosen by the Vice-President of Jindrzych Rajchl, most people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that in his choice, he will continue to work firmly.
He wants to make system changes and take the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individualbals.
He also promised to solve Bohemians, improve the relationships with EUFA and FIFA, bring more money into the ball and continue in the work that Ivan Hashek started in the previous president.
"As the President, I would like to make the ball as a whole."
"From international contacts with EUFA and the FIFA through representation, professional ball, youth executive ball."
"I don't say that I'd do everything alone," said Rajchl in a conversation for the CTK.
"I am a team player, and I want to share competence in the Executive Committee so that each member may be a certain person."
"And I'm going to give up the tasks that every segment has a mile step in front."
"Most many people wouldn't have done this joy because they would start working the truth in a strong manner and not just criticize the work of the ends," added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the ball movement, he was probably thinking that it was again to candidate.
"I know I'm doing 20 hours a day."
"But I think that it's gonna have a sense and that I'm gonna have people behind me who will continue to put my clocks under my feet and doubt every step," he explained why he was weakened.
"But many people told me I couldn't give it, because then they would give it to others."
"This is the confidence I can't just reject," he said.
It motivates him to continue in the work he started with Haske.
"For the two years a big job has been done and I don't want to lose it now."
"There are initiated processes that will have a dose to be given for a few years, and I don't want anyone to stop them," he assured that if you choose another candidate, Miroslava Pelty would have been able to return for a time before Haske.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's what Mirek Pelta doesn't think."
"To him are mostly men who would do it so that he would only be chosen for those."
"I can calculate a lot of things, but I'm sure not that I'm looking for somebody."
"I'm trying to be objects."
"I want to do a ball for all, because then everyone will be well and not just the choice," Rajchl noted.
He also claims that he's just the Czech President.
"Although some people's trying to make up again, I'm going to make Morava maximum."
"For example, it's time to consider that the second liga would divide themselves into the Czech and Moravia part of which the winners would go to the first body."
"There wouldn't be so modern when there are only three moral generals, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," said Rajchl.
Since the Chairman of the Pleasing Club of Tomás, Rajchl doesn't need to consider his choice chances.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech cell, which has chosen me for his president and sees that there is a success behind me," said Rajchl, who considers its success to protect ten millions of crowns on inadequate consequences, to negotiate television contracts and to negotiate lottery law.
On the contrary, it gives a partner that the connection doesn't take for one trip.
While about Pelt, he states that he is "dispersible from returning to the Czech Republic of Faith," the second of the partners of the Czech Republic considers a strong candidate who has the Bala what to offer.
"Nobody can be surprised that he took a great job in Plzni for that year."
"When he was chosen, he might continue in the things Ivan Hashek started here and no one would mainly change personal occupation in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to cross it in his benefit," Rajchl valued the rival.
Europe's most beautiful basin
Scroll to Blue
Julia Stanek
Broadcast from Ufon's view, Ufon's refrigerator in Budapest: Whoever travels to Europe can enjoy his blue miracle - and after the towns' viewer or traveling, let his feet rest in the terms.
The book will show where wellness is the most beautiful water.
When Iris Meder was released in the past one and a half of the year on the open road, it wasn't worth missing in her obligation: her flocks.
Leaving a mark on the water, she looked at the height of the art of the building cups, flooded towards the marmor road (which I set a little naked boy, a child (with a wheel)) which waited on it on the basen edge and wondered the nicely restored sequences.
If some of hers enjoyed her, she brought her into her recorder - and with careful details about the way of building and the story of the building.
More than 200 broadcasts examined this way the historical tech of Meder and presents them now in its right issued book "Badefreuden (Radost from buying) ": People's vessels in Mnichva, historical palace flooded in Schwarzwald,"Turde nuclear beton buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries conducted her "Road for the most usual dust in Central Europe": Dutch, Russia and Switzerland visited localities in Italy, France, Czechland, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old Germany is a real enthusiastic enthusiasm of the floor culture.
With the sport, it's not too much, says Meder -- it's just something else in the water.
Only the faults have to be satisfied with the blue bottles and chlorides, while running for health can breathe the amazing bowl of the dark forests or listen to the joyful lighting of birds in the park.
"Every day I wondered why actually the floor must be so nice," says Ms. Meder in Vietnam.
"So I started sharing nice floors."
The water level doubles the texture
The shopping in the Scokane bassin and the ether oil for sauna is therefore so big that it is about all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they could be a feast for the eyes: "They have a man in the waters' hole."
"It's, however, transparent, but on the other hand, it's reflecting the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is doubled by optics: high clothing, pesticides, rocks.
The Malformation Image Link "Badefreuden (Badfreuden)" provides on 190 pages everything you need to be discussed about historical and cultural oases wellnes - is exciting, but especially the calamity to go into blue.
Watchful copies discovered the collector of Ms. Meder's floor at her traveling in Hungary.
Along with beautiful medications, such as 100 years old Shechenyi, in Budapest, the water was found with the contents of dusicnans in the pung crassed yeskyni (scale in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the terms of the basin filled with alkalic water and located in the building of a lahve (Városi Termaluridö in Jaszberena).
Beautiful looking towards this are offering many exhausted floors under the large sky in Switzerland and Russia. As long as a man has from the Kurish cross-border shopping on the eye of the city, he can look at the snow covered Arlberg in St. Anton - and: In the couples is a window from which it is possible to watch the moves on the lingery stars.
I hope the most attentive design of the basen is expected by the hosts in Längenfeld: Akvapark Ötztal looks like ufo that just came to Alêch.
From three on top of the winter-opened winds, a couple stood while the mountain of Ötztal is in the back of the heavens.
Alhambra and Schwarzwaldu
Not in every floor, Mrs. Meder's basin collector was thrown in a chloride.
Many terms are feeling after sire, in the Ar’s lazs in Hungarian Békescsab, that is tough oil in the measure that humans will just believe that he has reached the medical disease.
The powder comes from the medical water with the contents of alkaline hydrogenulicants, which is almost black and its powder slips on the skin as only a man enters into the bassin - sometimes a special benefit of wellness.
However, in one place, Iris Meder was also looking for nice flames: When she wanted to visit the Czech Solar and Climate Lake Luhaczo, she reached a closed territory.
In 1902, Dushan Jurkovic was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the rocking windows of red-white-glass sequence buildings, she saw the potentially growing floor between the pools.
In contrast to this, the Zanku was located in a shopping vessel in Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These weights have three phases of exhibition; a man can not only discover new Roman elements that are buried from the time of his exhibition in 1844, but also the Mauritious Sheet in Alhambra, which was attached around 1900.
Since 1995, Palais Thermal is the favorite place of lazena, the famous basin of Mrs Iris Meder, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's the same effect, connecting so many building stocks to a so beautiful complex," Mrs. Meder says.
In such a palace, it is obviously a surrounding in the terminal basen.
Agricultural speculations
Deutsche Bank allows to verify commodities trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave his trade with landscapes?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann believed the work group to investigate the results of speculation for the poor world.
Then in January, the boss wants to carry out the investigations.
Hamburg -
For the citizens is a matter: 84% of Germans, according to one study, are not acceptable to speculate the banks with agricultural sugars such as vegetables or kitchens.
Two thirds of the questioned even require Deutsche Bank and the final credit institutions from this trade because the problems of the world's world's world's worst problems are lost.
This is the result of the Force survey from the confirmation of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The report that Foodwatch presented in the half of October is addressed.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the taxes in global commodity bubbles exhausted prices in the height and that the banks have a partnership with the world's famine problem.
The campaign of consumers is designed specifically against the boss Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
In fact, commodities were thoughts to ensure that businessmen would be contrary to price expenditures.
In the meantime, however, the experts agree that the interests of high risk trades have been dismissed from the offers and requests - and the best benefits have been achieved.
Otherwise, competitors in the United States reacted to Ackermann's criticism: He promised that the results would be checked and said that no trade "is not for the good story of Deutsche Bank to be given in the middle."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international work is controlled by the Foodwatch-Report group.
The control shall be closed until the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank representation, together with the recommendation to be submitted.
On the end of January, the representatives of the bank want to inform the results.
Finally, the reduction of trade with commodities or even a complete refusal could be made.
Ackermann works with his help on his image.
The Chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time enhanced its criticism of the financial sector: "The seat on the growing price of food shows particularly drastics, as the banks are injured to the general goods today."
Let Ackermann be as the highest bank and the lobbys have a obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from his portfolio all items in which money is used for food prices," said Bode.
"It's great if Mr. Ackermann is about the famine of suffering people or about the story of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears first as a surprising view, but it is that the Concern Boss for a few months before his department from the office would never leave a perfect image.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank notified that the head of the representation would not go to the Supervisory Board.
Return from a sportive agricultural speculation could improve his image.
And the possibility of loss is not needed to be careful - with that he should be advised to the end of his representative.
Each second would make investment in the surface
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a high pressure on the manager.
There have already been more than 30,000 internet participants in the organization campaign.
The Bode published in the district the entity in which the Institute Fors asked 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only eleven per cent is based on the legitimacy that Deutsche Bank offers investments with which the feed prices are related.
Many bank clients would also carry out personal investigations if they knew that their banks were shared in such trades: each other would report all investments in which money was replaced in the speculation of surfaces.
43 per cent would warn known to such a bank, 49 per cent indicated that they would think of their statement and go to another institution.
Home of the 21th century in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
Periods with tops, falls and happy ends: Rakuski Pavilon from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 has gained prices, became a Museum in Vienna, remained empty and released.
Now it is opened again as an exhibition house.
When it burns for the modern wallet, for forms, glassed glasses, mild dimensions and new building materials that are typical for the faith in the technical progress, then the race pavilion, Karla Schwanzer, for the Brussels World Exhibition of 1958, is an excellent and glorious example.
The Swanzer's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his easily and easily acting from oil and glass.
The station has been set up as a milk of the current station.
He praised the text so that he also built the Pavilon of Rakous for the next world exhibitions.
With his Legendary Four-Wall BMW palace plus as a key to the outside building in Mnich, he finally glorified internationally.
As a temporary exhibition designed pavilion after the world’s exhibition, it was placed in the Swiss Garten at the South Bahnhof (South Tradition), reconstructed and opened Museum in 1962 - was called "Home of the 20th century".
But it was not suitable for the museum of the building, neither space nor technology - missing walls for closing artificial exposures, no exhausting climate.
However, it was used until the current art occurred in Vienna’s new station.
Since 2001, the building was empty and was still more and more.
Now the Adolf Krischanitz pavilon has rebuild, now has the name "Home of the 21th century" and will be used in the future as Museum of the present art.
In the morning evening, Museum Belveder will open, where the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy purpose in all aspects.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became a new director of the Russian Gallery Belveder 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted historical art with a significant career, e.g. in a young crass-border, in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's museum, and as manager of the modern Museum of Salzburg, made a variety of restructuring in politics and memories, watched public and private sponsory money and determined use.
Besides the current art, works of Fritze Wotruby's coach should be made with the same named opinion, the café and booking should be produced, and the office building should be established.
Good supervision, lower budget.
Then Krischanitz was a ideal occupation.
Not only that he rebuild and expanded the sequence buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and wined competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Wideo and Pavilon was a "increasingly important place", on which he saw the exhibition.
He knew the popproject and also knew the problems of the building that had already lost its greatness and easily when he moved to Witness and changed the use.
At the present restructuring, there were a far more difficult problems: Budova was "energy catapult", says Krischanitz.
The windows of glassed fasade profiles have been changed, using glassed flames of isolated glass and glassed steel was replaced by a special safety grid.
Cold-ocean nostress were sealed or changed, and asbest filled strokes were sanished.
Two underground grounds have a place for new use, left light channel between the building and the streets, and the input of the town - almost new building, but still the Swanzer's pavilion.
The input doors have been kept, the building is cut off in the old anti-corrose red wheel tone.
And the film is even exactly the same as it was before.
And it's all for a close monitoring of the Memorial Authority and a low budget.
"Freely, it must have been found a material that is good and leaving and also enjoyed the memory authority," says Krischanitz and shows it on a broad ground of suteren.
Over all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airful.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "Who came here from Brussels," said Crischanitz recently, the typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such assets appear to be "always in the wrong place" and, however, wants to be a suitable self-conscience.
In this case, however, there is no home of the 21th century in an inevitable place, because the urbanist success has occurred: In the circuit of Schweizer Garten, the new "Capital quarter" is designed with office and resident houses.
And may still come to another happiness: Home of the 21th century could receive support from another Crischanitz building, because the assembly of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and how to hear them, one with the city of neighborhood in Swiss Garten.
Draha plans a package for winter crisis in millions of higher
The road was a crises plan to protect the accidents of the woods during the winter period.
The beginning of employees must be doubled.
That's going to be millions.
In combating winter accidents, Germane Bahn issues more than 70 million euros in this year, according to the newspapers of more than 70 million.
The news "image" reported a preliminary report to the internal concert plan that it was calculated by a total of EUR 300 million in 2015.
Its help must also be achieved in the better use of flames and rail networks for extreme luminosity submines.
In addition, the number of intern and external employees is planned for 16,000 people to remove snow on railway equipment and staff.
The purpose must be to be removed from the start of the operation and 90 per cent for the operation of necessary movements within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the leader of the drama Rüdiger Grube warned after meetings at the highest level with the representative of the Government and the future before the accident of the floor and the late ends of the air winter.
In the past winter period, there were significant problems in personal transport because, despite the distress of the disorders, there were no reserves.
Thus, new regional flocks are expected for years to approve the Joint Railway Authority.
Moreover, it is accessible to the latest of the ICE heat lamps
The road is also not allowed to be more frequently controlled by ICE’s ICE’s carrier in the main coast of Köln to destruct the correction.
Deutsche Bank pays a million of dollars in the United States
After breaking around the boss Joseph Ackermann, it comes to new trampots in the United States: Deutsche Bank must pay millions of losses there.
As a result of problems at home, Deutsche Bank has not already been enough, but has yet concluded its past in the United States: The French institution is paying 145 million dollars in one balance management (106 million euros) in order to equippe the bankroot of five large company banks through the financial crisis.
It's the sale of hypothetic papers.
The NCUA financial market regulator calculates a number of large banks that the banks have been acquired by false promises to buy financial products; that the risk is probably decreased.
Such papers have lost significantly the value of the crisis and the banks have lost themselves to lose.
"We're convinced that we could resolve the subject without the need of the parties to join the court," said the speaker Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not recognize any wine.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has been committed to paying $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the correspondence of both money institutions.
National Credit Union Propertyation (CUA) is responsible for the United States banks and helps bankroots to protect the prohibition requests.
The NCUA is trying to obtain a refund for a rare billion damage.
Now finished balances are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took place on other large banks, and in the year, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In doubting hypothetics, such as Mortgage-backed Securities are addressed.
These are based on bank credits.
When the American bublin was broadcast around the possibility in 2007, it became a lot of financial fires.
In September 2008, the financial crisis changed its opinion on the top of the US-Investment Bank Lehman Brothers.
Although it came to the attack a few years ago, the banks are now footing in the street of the wind.
The investors and the supervisory offices have granted claims to achieve adjustments or doubts.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) laid down the largest wave of claims.
It refers to 18 international major banks that two State American financials who are involved in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in trade with hypoteches in approximately 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank must also comply with the FHFA complaint, which is more than 14,2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires that the French establishment be responsible for the "compliant loss" without putting the exact amount in place.
Deutsche Bank rejected the requests as an independent and declared that she wanted to defend.
Warren Buffett enters 10 billion in IBM
Buffett's financial mouth invests potentially into IBM IT substances.
Since March he purchased a share in more than 10 billion dollars.
A significant American investor Warren Buffett acknowledged that investment in IT and computers, because fire development only allows to predict difficulties.
However, he has now read the business reports of IBM and has changed its changes on investments in the market.
He had already had to understand that IBM offers services and provides computer systems for IT-separation of other companies.
Warren Buffetta's investment is found in the financial world for the passport on the river.
In the result of this, the IBM's mother's hornine is now called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has seen in the American economic vote station of the CNBC that he has purchased the IBM action from March at $10.7 billion.
His investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shared by 5,5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about his business yet.
He praised the management that was trying to make economic crisis even for the rational expenditure.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has already set a long time on the lucracy – IT services as the operation of the outcome centres.
More than 100 years of computers offers software and advice and executive computers for companies.
Buffett's becoming out of this day.
It claims that it is only invested in companies whose activities are also understanding.
Instead, Buffett sat after the cost railway, after the manufacturer or after the manufacture of machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has also shared around about 80 of his own daughter fires in a number of big concerts such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Münchener Back.
The 81-year master took a small textile company of Berkshire Hathaway in the past 60s and built with her a wise investment of one of the most precious businesses in the world.
Yet, his way of life is humble.
It's therefore for many investments throughout the world a culture.
His nearly inomiable sense of making money brought him the "Orakel from Omaha (Orakel of Omaha).
When Buffet's investment became known, IBM's action stood before starting a percentage.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a total price of over 220 billion dollars in the burst and is established together with Apple and Microsoft for the most precious world business.
In the Microsoft company, so much Buffett, but he doesn't want to go.
The founder Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The threat is hard.
After the discovery of the "Bunny in Zwickau", the Turkish media doubt about the German legal state.
The news are even talking about "blood ideology", which is now alive again.
The eight major companies of the Turkish Pound and one of the Greek in 2000 to 2006 had rightly extremist backgrounds.
This report was reacted to fear and anxiety in Turkey and within the German and Turkish population in Germany.
Because for many German Turks, it returns the fear that was constituted for dead: From the brand attacks in Mõn in November 1992 and in Salenge in May 1993, there was no comparative violence with the right extremist background.
The fact that in Germany there was xenofobie, however, has never been doubted.
However, the right-extremist network has discovered the range of which dimensions cannot be considered for a long time.
"There's a bloody ideaology again?", reported the titles of the "Haberturk" newspapers of the "Haberturk" to the Internet.
In contrast, the news of Sabah highlights that one of the pachators had to be a secret police officer for the protection of the establishment and fear that German authorities could also be involved in the right radical bath.
The Turkish province of Germany reacted very prominently: She remembered the weekend of the demonstration of silence before the Brandeburian port of the victim of racial violence.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish town in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish Policy, reminded the celebration Act of the fifty-year-year German and Turkish agreement on the construction.
In the joyful colors, a common life was insinuated - as a successful success.
As a pool here, the reporting of some Turkish media: "The Dutch to the 50s" is the heading of the article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the back of the murder series.
Also publishing the magazine "Hürriyet" for Germany can't take it so that it doesn't take this thinking connection.
"The begins to keep it," sounds the title of the Column from Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid tax and made their work a significant contribution to the renewal of Germany were killed.
The most critical is discussed in the German Internet forests of police process and its final success in the watch.
Why the German authorities haven't seemed much before to watch in the right extreme cross, the authors have wondered.
So many are leading to at least a retoric complaint to use drastical rubbers: "If the activity continues to be done so surrounded, there will be nothing other than the own defence and weapons."
"It's probably the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and accuracy of the entire network is very strongly dependent on the internal peace in Germany ", writes "Selen".
What it means, if the internal peace is threatened in Germany, they explain atentates in Mın and Salenge in the ninety years.
Fotography burning in Sollingen is deeply thrown into the memory of Germans and Turks.
For there was no other event shown to Turkish living here that there was a fatal threat to Germans and that the uncertainty and disturbance could lead to the right violence.
However, the atents have affected Turks more evident feelings of mutuality.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish print, the German policy failure was criticized at the time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those who survived in Mın.
After a fertility attack in Solingen, he sent a constraint telegram to the Turkish State President, but he left to celebrate a consensus in Köln his minister by Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated the payments of Turkey.
That's exactly as if the value of a man was measured according to the height of his tax.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows again how deeply many German Turks are not confidential in the current state-level organization.
According to the effort of a comprehensive interpretation and a new evaluation of the right of extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scandal bank at Curysh Lake
The best European bank has no seat in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered for financial crisis, as well as bankrot, and from one crisis to another from that time.
Now the German has to compare it.
So, Axel Weber wasn't thinking about it.
After his appeal from the head of the Government of the Society Bank, in July it became known that it would take 2013 to the same repeated new employment: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for his beautifulness and UBS for her newly obtained solidity and said friendly notes about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has reached the operation."
"I'm happy to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, everything would be fully different.
One UBS dealer in London was running all bank security systems and about 1,7 billion euros was lost.
UBS representative boss Oswald Grübel, not only a recognised banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Administrative Council has been as well as as the found - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber ́e can work since February 2012.
And the President's Administrative Council will be taken in May - not just in 2013, as the bank had been reported in an emergency.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be strong.
It's not a banker, more than a professional of the economy and the banker, and he'd certainly need a time to work.
We will then take the responsibility for the bank's strategy, which just once again proved that it deserved the title of the "The Bank of the Greatest Scanners in Europe"
Because UBS is, however, great - until recently, the greatest manager of the world's property - but it's clouding for a year from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it doesn't seem to be a fierce Swiss bank.
It started for financial crisis.
In 2007, UBS used a excellent story.
The image of silent and solid, but also the ambitional objectives of the property manager is combined by the ambitional manager: she also wanted to mean something in the investment banknote.
So UBS 2007 was managed on one hand with $1,6 billion more than any other world bank.
And, on the other hand, it was a investment bank in the liquor of the largest world banks.
That's what I was doing.
An ex-banker and the old-old banking professor in Curych Hans Geiger states: "I've noted UBS to my students as a model of good banks."
"How could I just be able to hurt like this today?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, something was clearly clearly shown in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli's representative boss was surprised, which has already been established as a highly intelligent and also a genial banker.
In a few months later, he realized why he left.
The bank's investment divisions missed subprime papers and had to repeat billions.
In order to make it possible, UBS advertised the increase in the range of 13 billion franks.
It was therefore found in investment, but it was so discreet that humans did not know his name.
But it was just the first time.
In April 2008, it was worse.
Bank had to admit a new billion losses, President of the Marcel Ospel Government Council, 2006 the second best payable Board of Switzerland, left.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS became its misleading investment for the financial crisis before the destruction and had to be saved by the State.
National Bank solved the UBS for ten billion billion valuable papers, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion franks to the obligation to change the obligation for which the joint bank could be established.
The whole Switzerland was cut off - because he noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when he has so large banks in his territory.
Finally, UBS 2007 was more than five times more than the Switzerland economy (see image).
"They couldn't save UBS again," says BankoGeiger.
The second is the first catastrophe.
For a few months, UBS held it in tax dispute with America and showed the will to issue the data of compulsory clients who if my bank was supported, the tax was ratified.
Moreover, she agreed with the payment of $780 million - as the return of unfair benefits from these trades, in the case of a deceased advantage.
The UBS has experienced more or less openly that it has helped the tax ratification.
At the same time, she lost something that was rejecting her chair in competition with rich clients: a sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Switzerland bank wasn't already secret what was before.
The head of representation and the President of the Administrative Council were followed.
And exodus the money of the clients.
Thus, the bank lost its equality in both central business: in the investment banking facility for bad speculators and in the management of the property for tax ratification.
And just when it was a little quiet again, just when the UBS thought that it was renewed, this nocturnal business anabesia comes here: the only dealer lost 1,7 billion euros before the bank noticed that it was something wrong.
And it's fair: with the management of risks in the investment banknote, it's likely not yet wrong.
"The case of Adoboli has probably secured that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, the economy and the Financial Professor of Financiality at the Bank's Institute of the University Zürich.
The financial manager of the Great German Bank is also saying, "Problem UBS does not control risks."
Instead, this was exactly the idea of the care that Switzerland bankers had done before a time to become guardians of the great possessions of the world: no too large risk, therefore the security of money - also from this side, the Albanian Republic rebuild the world.
The Swiss bank tresors became a symbol of inconsistent compatibility such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly quality chocolate.
The UBS center in Curychu is still going to the good Swiss private banks - is just a little more.
The position is classic.
Bank has its main seat in the Kurish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curish Lake, which is embarrassed by the tops of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are wonderful, the acquisition of trade belongs to the highest in Europe.
Clenotics like Tiffany's are found here between Swiss traditional trades like Sprüngli sugars.
Since the centuries, the Swiss bank sits here: from the National Bank through Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
UBS is entered into the receiving hail with hard turning doors.
Inside the walls are covered by a marmor, and there are potential skin steels before them, next to the bank's log, a large guide to the "seif".
UBS knows what the client is looking for: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank both Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, sometimes - have touched or produced how the boss finds a small Swiss private bank.
His name would never want to read in news, finally, as all Switzerland bankers, including with both large banks of trade.
UBS is probably too large, especially in the investment banknote, where the unexpansions have been extended.
Switzers have no more to say.
"And if it were, they had been adapted to English ways for a long time."
In fact, it was the English investment banknote that UBS changed, which led its first high profits and then the burst: No European financial institution lost the money like the Swiss Granbank in the jungle around Subprime.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was manifest.
"In that middle, the Governing Coal of Seven million countries were raised to the greatest salvation action in its people," writes the author Luc Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion franks or approximately 45 billion euros, the politicians have approved to save the bankroom of the capital bank.
How could it be?
If the Swiss banks are talking, they see your problem, especially in UBS size.
In June 1998, two of the three Switzerland major banks were connected to the potential concert.
The bank has already been too large for Switzerland during the fusy - and has continued to grow.
Instead, both separate banks were added to the UBS preliminary: one rich, but a blind bank in Curycha with difficulties in the management of property and poor, but internationally stronger involved.
The internationalized investment bankers immediately came to many money with which they could solve a great rule.
With this access, UBS are connected two titles: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Governing Council.
"I've always thought Wuffli and Ospel are the team of future," says Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble, who knows many of the models and statistics and Ospel, a man's feeling around the whistle that worked up from the bank."
But, uh, it's not the end of the wuffli.
And Wuffli, at the end, probably allowed a decisionful error: "I thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, the spirit has fallen.
UBS employees are focused on the main work leaders on which the Concern Boss Wuffli has still repeated the same password: Srazit Goldman Sachs from the throne below.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the world.
She said "League Tables", a officer who documents the success of the bank at that time.
The UBS tried to locate completely up there.
There's been a few steps.
The games were completely upstairs in the negotiation with divisions and actions.
However, business advisers who have been convinced highlight one weakness: in the international accounting trade, in the term "Fixed Income" bankers, it is likely that there is a great decline to the largest banks.
UBS has some areas in American hypothetic products.
In order to close this area, UBS decided to be a well-being that was almost existence.

Intelligent wounds are spread in cities
In many places, the havres of the field are placed for "problem birds": However, these high-intelligent animals cannot be released from the city for a long time, strong experts.
Some are owners, they would be able to save them very much: The wounds belong to the image of the city since the centuries, but in some communities, the inhabitant's complaint to the uncleanness and the sound of the animals caused.

The Havrani fields may not be able to go out of the city, the experts on the first symposium of the injuries in Eastern African Leer.
There were consultations of experts from the entire social area on possible exits.
Search for alternatives in towns
Natural protectors also rejected the problems of towns from the exode of specially protected hazards in the field: the use of chemicals in agriculture as well as in a growth of traditional life.
Training, growing deception and coating of typical trees to break up birds makes life difficult.
The backs are protected.

Masker at personal level
Emotionally strong new book Peter Anglunda with the name of Krása and Suspension: The trusted history of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with the long list of positions that appear until you get the head.
One advice to keep on this moment: Take care of this page and make a bookmark from it.
With all people, you are very well familiar with Mr. Anglund's Roman report, and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a boy - in the moments you will feel as men and women in history, as you are going to feel disappointment and loss in different responsibilities.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish history and a journalist.
It is also a new project on the Swedish Academy, which gives Nobel the price for Â.
The book we're enjoying here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, completely, as "antihisto work".
It contains a number of very known names, important contracts or celebrations, however, there is a lack of publics, energy journalists and discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book of what happened, explains the author, as well as "the book of what it was." It's mainly negotiated with " feelings, thoughts, experiences, and injuries."
"Worry and anxiety" in it combines 20 warrior inhabitants less than men and women, on both sides of baricade, from students and botanics to horoleses, doctors, salvators and officers.
Some of these people become herds.
Others will become war prisoners, come to the end, to be foolish or to die.
Their lives are mixed as flames of lights in the cossel - new added to the web of judgments, while others are arrested.
The book of Mr. Anglund is different from the classic historical Romans.
He adjusts the idea that the First World War was only about horrible wars on the Western front.
"Crash and worry" are also able to examine other places where war dramatics were running: Alpy, Balkan, East front, Mezopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve problems with the falling of the nests on them, they have to travel Christmas in the shadow of pyramid, or they are faced with the presence of much tse-tse.
From the beginning, it's about a very grateful reading.
The war will lead people to life as a natural disaster, such as Katrina urican, a shooting work.
When it begins to get a shot from the part, and you are a woman who is home with your children, you will flee or stay?
Who's really close to this?
No one understands what's going on, even why the whole war was dissolved.
"Vakuum resulted from the lack of facts," Mr. Englund noted, "the agreements, opinions, on thee, on the subjects, on the presence, on the conspiratory theories, dreams, night morms and famays were filled."
"Brace and worry" follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Farmborough, an English health sister in Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young seasoner who serves in German football.
Their stories are all overseered from lifegraphs, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives can sound disturbingly, but the combining of detailes and details are absolutely alive and reliable.
Many of them are negotiating to watch and balance with him.
In the history of German students, the author says, "Countries, all the same refunds."
"Coffee's coffee relief, the imitation of the gym, the paper boxes, the wood buttons."
He's still going on and describes the replacements of food in Germany.
It is mentioned on "mass made of lised rise covered in the woods (and added to false bone from wood), tobacco from sucked roots and sucked wooden woods, bottles with wood woods".
It recalls that there were "837 registered meat refunds in the production of parks and 511 registered coffee refunds".
Some stories are about honesty and devotion.
One American in himself is located inside the widow and brutality, as about the war, "You finally understand that this is a human nature. Never siting in a convenient cross with cigarette and whisky, evening news or good books, and imagine that this mask represents civilization and that there is no color behind me in the nitro."
Instead, the British soldier realizes that with the greatest probability he will die soon, and no one will not notice it or not, but he will triumph.
"When a man finally relaxes with the sacrifice, he would expect at least that will happen before the air of the thankful public," he says.
But instead, it seems to be a "courage that is secretly incensed".
Other notes are related to the decline of old Europe and the progress of new fears.
"The conflict with which the economic competition and competition was more competitive," says Mr. Englund, "a war between the companions."
He captured what he said "the new species of the beast of the next century: an explanable and ideologically promising massive murder in the shots of the peace that his blood flows, without rising from the table."
People are totally unexpected, the land is coincidence with herds.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who are prominently trying to catch a illness from the prostitute to avoid the service on the front.
"The greatest example of this behaviour was negotiating with a gonokoke kiss that soldiers purchased and cut off genitality in the sense that it would end in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most confidents have cut him into the eyes, which has often blinded until the end of life."
In this translation of the Swedish from Peter Gravese, Mr. Englund's prosecution is a famous, but no one has shown what is nice to his human theme.
In the decades of detailed outcomes, the way the war "hare has completely disappointed unexpected forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are supposed to fight.
The best books of the First World War more than with a complex story worked with signs, such as "The World War and modern exhibitions" from Paula Fussella or Romans as "To the Western front tranquil" by Ericha Maria Remarquea.
Mr. Englund gives an advantage to the inconvenience.
His book has the most increasing arrangements that have no period in the literature.
But I'm not going to blame him with you.
However, you will seem like the author immediately sprinkled out of the book, cut a page out of the list of herds and burned it.
After the previous missing this time a minute exactly planned time
Hundreds of police officers, some of them, were involved in the gateway disorders.
On Monday night to the shot was selected because the Zuccotti park should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the action other than some of the highly established duties, and the other was first said that it was about the habits.
In the head of the action, the police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police division had to deal with the operation.
The cases of the last weeks were not to be repeated, for example, when the use of pepper adoptions against demonstrants, which violated the rules of the section, and also the wheel of the public's simpatization had passed on the side of squatters.
It was therefore a police operation that aimed at cleaning the Zuccotti park from demonstrators, started up to two weeks of careful planning and planning.
Leader representatives have been allowed to inspire operations in the rest of cities.
Mass habits for the case of behavior in Crises was running in Randalls Island, which was prepared for action in Zuccotti park.
The leaders have strengthened such a training for disappointment - anti-terrorist measures that include the movement of a large number of police officers - by focusing on the city of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the education passed on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the river East River.
The orders to move to the park came to the word "in the last minute" to someone whose action was fully explained only as "cwiking".
"I know a couple of police officers who were also invited to this action, and nobody said to them that he was going to Zuccotti park," said the person who spoke only under the submination that he would remain anonymous.
"On to go to the Zuccotti park, they've just made the highest position of the members of the Department."
One of the damage was a lesson that the city had received once.
On October 14, the representatives of the town had to clean the park, but then they lost from the plan because, as demonstrators heard of it, they were included before the start of the operation in the park of a hundred.
The internal action was held by police officers from different units, including decades of the whole area, which are currently used to strengthen the quarter with a higher level of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day the park comes and a lot of people go back, so one hour tonight was a perfect time when the action starts.
"It was appropriate to make it at the time when at least people will be in the park," he said.
Before the units were exposed, the Pike Slip Street and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bri; the costs of carrying units with cloud lamps and amplions.
The light and the recorded news of the amplions were scared of many demonstrators.
When the members of the order units entered into the park in their blue vessels, many demonstrators packed their things and went away.
The police claims that until 1:45, she didn't reach the only apartment that she wanted to give the demonstrators time to packaging things.
Other teams of police were watched to cover the park's area so that they could be able to get into resource if it was necessary to carry out an accommodation.
The reporters were required to leave the park.
The speaker of the police department Paul J. Browne said that it was so for their security.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in the action, and some police officers also kept them.
Mr. Browne claimed that television vehicles at Church Street leadership of the western park border could be cut off without problems.
Police was in the west direction, and it was prosecuted by a cruel mistake of individuals protesting things, including bindings and igelites of full of clothes, which followed the teams of the hygiene division, which immediately worked all that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were removed from the park, and the documenting materials appeared sometimes on the Internet.
The most famous group of demonstrators went near the kitchen in their camp, which lies near the middle of the park.
Some have created a bathroom, and the police started their methodic attack.
There were about ten people in the camp center.
And two people joined the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
They were allowed members of the preparation services to overcome locks.
By 3:30 in the park, there was no intervention, Mr. Kelly told me.
The whole operation was completed at about 75 minutes after, the police's exhibition.
Mr. Browne said there was about 142 people in the park.
The majority of the prisons went out of the "Organization of Resistance and Resistance", explained.
The highest posted police officer at the place of action was Joseph J. Es日o, head of the police division, the highest uniformed department.
Operation was also aware of Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department Detectives.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he did not share in the operation," Mr. Browne said.
The second group of police were waiting for the east side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty Street and Cedar Street, for the case that it would be necessary to allow it.
On the Cortlandt Street Street, the north of the park, and on the Pine Street Street Street, the block southern from the park, were thrown up.
From these places, the police developed a protective feed from Zuccotti park.
In one place, police officers were watched, from which many of them were equipped, as people were spent away from this border.
There were some 28 people at the north border.
The most wonderful action of the night passed south of the park.
About five hours a demonstrator was seen south from Pine Street, as he shot to the police car captain, and a few other who left air from pneu.
In one minute, the cockpit was running out of the dave.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protestant was hospitalized.
The committee of assistant workers will complain the city for exemption
The Committees representing hundreds of school help workers who have come to work last month are planning to blame the city in the middle of the town. They claim that the release was not necessary and that it was further discriminated because of an inappropriate impact on the school visiting poor students.
The Court of Justice is probably the latest options that the Committee in District Council 37 remains in their efforts to repeat the decision of release.
Seventh October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, family coordinators and other employees who belonged to the worst payable employees of the town. Their releases were described as a payment of the town because they were not allowed to access the health care fund by reading the town by means of which the town wanted to flee in the budget.
The representatives of the city rejected this category.
The Minister of School of Dennis M. Walcott said that the release was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately checked that there was no specific talk in the budget on the exemption of the aid workers.
The representatives of the District Council 37 reported that they had already fulfilled the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of School that they would complain it. In the middle of the pressure, where they formally announce a complaint at the High State Court of Manhattan.
Mr Walcott and the Ministry of School will be accused of the process, while the complainting party will be the eight lost works, from whom all are African or hiss, as well as the rest of those who have come to work.
Elizabeth Thomas, speaker of the town's legal division, said that the city hadn't yet seen a complaint, so that it would be expressed to individual accusations.
According to the complaint of New York Times, the committees were focused on the numbers of the poor parts of the city, who wanted to support their claims on unrighteous acts.
They show that while schools in Staten Island were not left in total and at least in the Upper East Side part, in Brooklyn, part 23 of the district in Brownsville, 17 school assistants, and in sections 8 and 9 in South Bronx, even 46 assistants were released.
It is likely that at the University of Public School 36 in Harle, five of the eight assistants have lost work, although it's about school where 68 percent of students live in poverty.
The start of the Public School 36 was decreased by 3.26 percent years, and the school also arrived for money when the city changed the way to calculate bonus funds for each of the poor students.
The Committees, other than otherwise, claim that the directors of the Mediterranean School could be determined by the way that document was written that authorises the release of family coordinators.
The document used for the description of the action by the word "excess", thus refusing the position, although this word is more frequently used for the description of the movement of the factors from the school's payment sheet to the database of available works, which is limited by the Central Authority.
"Seventy-six family coordinators have been released," they stand in charge, "and never only moved to the database on the location of available workers."
Mission is at the end, Congress is ready to adopt a Libya agreement
Finally, the Republic and the Democracy will agree with something about the resurrection in Libya.
However, before this occurred, the revolution had to succeed, and for a period of Governing Dictator Muammar Kaddafi had to be arrested and killed and a number of United States units had been completed.
The Commission for International Senate Relations will decide on the exhibition supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McC:m (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which Libyans should be thanked for their successful resurrection and the American units.
"These statement we want to evaluate the courage of the people of Libya who started with the construction of their country," said Kerry.
"But the political spectrum sides would like to support their democratic efforts."
This may seem innocent, but no debate related to Libya has been easily.
During the years, the lawmakers of both sides continued to consider the version of a series of declarations to approve or reject the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain represented resolutions allowing the use of American armed forces in Libya.
It was rejected in Snevney because of the different opinions of both political parties, so it was never voted in the Senate.
However, at the same time that the chair was rejected in Snevvia, the chair also refused measures to stop financing American operations in Libya.
This is what the American mission in Libya experienced in the legislative cleaning - Congress criticized the way the President of Obama's mission conducted, but its members obviously did not hurt so much to stop supporting him at its start.
Finally, the adventure of the congress had been predicted by further events.
Rebels received Tripolis in August, and on October 20, Kaddafi was killed.
Miss Nato officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate is probably ready to act.
The Commission for international relations in its declaration "congratulations to the people of Libya for their indirect courage and wonderful concern they have been able to free their people" and "thank to men and women of armed forces of the United States and their associations who participated in the operation for the protection of Libyan residence, for extraordinary nationality and professionality."
The statement also confirms the national interest of the United States in successful and unreverse transition to democracy in Libya.
Does the Commission's full support for international relations, or will the legislators again be divided into two halfs, as it was in the approval of the Red Point?
On the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugar's speaker on Monday said he hadn't seen the final version of the new story yet.
This week will be voted on the Statute, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority at all of the Republics and Democrats in the Congo.
This measures, assessed by Bob Goodlat (Va.), shall be the first subparagraph of the Establishment of the budget or other topic to vote in the whole of the Sněm or the Senate.
The other legislators have not yet been able to interfere with the vote.
Goodlat's advice is only one of the 68°s to the establishment, represented at the conference and touched the wide scales of different subjects.
Some of them were the same - the same thing is presented in Snemovly and Senate - and others are only the small exchanges of others.
Only in Snevney can be found at least 15 versions of the balanced budget and the other resort that would "regulate the federal expenditure".
Some of us, though, are the same, but their staff - especially the starting publicans who want to improve the story - can glorify their "health".
The budgetary regulation which was approved in August requested to vote in respect of the balanced budget by Sněmovna and Senat.
In March 58, the Senators voted in the benefit of an illegal declaration to support the result of this.
Besides the budget, several members want to negotiate and limit the number of periods in which the members of the convention could serve while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) want to increase the period to be in the president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole range of assets that would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
Permanently, there remains an additive prohibiting couples of the same seed and an additive prohibiting the fire of the State flag.
Some legislators also want to enable the cancellation of federal laws in the case of two third countries against them.
Although the members of the Congress seem to be very active in the course of various areas, in comparison with the previous years, they do not exhaustively decline from the average.
In the 11th Congress, they offered 77, while in the 100th Congress they were 66.
Their activity even blends in comparison with the beginning of the 90s of the 20th century when, according to the senate books, members offered each two years more than 150 or more.
However, they were not much more successful than the current policy.
The latest added - 27th appendix - was added in 1992, but the Congress was proposed in 1789.
"Small, but not hurt," says Gifford in his first television chat from shooting
Ten months after the shooting on the public meeting with the electors in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) discovered her on Monday at a total TV, she sing together with a melodia from the broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declared that more than return to Congress was worth to salute.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" order at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation still makes problems and needs help.
The whole order documented her rekonvalescentials, which was necessary for the destruction of a caused bowl, which was spread before it, split down the left half of the brain and behind them out of the head.
Three months ago, she was surprisedly returned to Sněmna to participate triumphally on the vote on the debt.
At his first television interview from the yellow shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were hurt, Giffords laughed, smiled and songs -- and she described her detention as "swak".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she answered the one-five-year-old Giffords, "Very well."
The conversation with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour special work of the "20/20" series, which was sent to the previous evening to issue a new book of this couple, named "Gabby: Period of courage and attitude".
Specially followed the entire Gifford reconvalidance from the shooting of 8 January.
On the videos that Kelly switched during the first week, it's to see Giffords in the hospital bed with a thrown head and a rubber over the whole head.
While her husband encourages her, she can't be able to raise one or two fingers at that time.
Over a few months later, Giffords is arrested, sitting in the cocktail chair and terapeutics teach her how to perform simple activities.
Pushing the head.
Exhaustion of lips.
And then, her first word, "What."
During a few days, Giffords expressed another word - "toast", when she asked changes in her dinner.
ABC's highlighted stations shows that a traveling role for Gifford's music playing: Congressmank can sing on them together with a melodie therapy to the song "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" from Tom Petty.
During Gifford's discussion, which holds two hours a day of therapy, Sawyer did not remember anything from the day when the shooting arrived.
Her husband said Gifford had preached the news articles on shooting up to 12 March when she first asked him who was the sixth who was killed at the accident.
From the shooting, the suspicious Jared Lee Loughner, who is held in Missoury's campaign, where violently given medicines are waiting for the court process.
"Too many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Free, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that at one time his wife stated, "I've lost."
"That's what I said to her right now, Gabby, you didn't lose," said Kelly.
"Now you got a coach.
But you'll be able to do it, you'll get back and get back more stronger than ever before."
The military units are more competitive than with respect
This event was a galaxer at Wall Street, who has brought millions of dollars for war veterinarians in New York who have no shot over the head.
Kid Rock sing a ballaad about weakness, frustration, and loss.
They moved around hundreds of soldiers, mariners, flyers and mariners.
The honestly dressed damage rises up and softed.
"The men and women who served in the army were considered herds," said David Saltzman, who was a jealous benefit.
The celebration dinner was also involved by the President of the Committee of Chiefs of the Chairs of the Chairmans. Besides, advocate Mike Mullen was at the place, who, however, saw the role of military units sometimes differently.
"All were represented as the poor poverty," he wrote in the e-mail.
I'm sure the organizations thought that well.
I know yes.
But what I saw wasn't respect.
Thus, totally contrary ideas only illustrate a bad relationship between the army and the often disturbed, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The soldier is freely included by praise for his victims.
But these praise are worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is still more walking as if the one in the uniform would be foolish.
"We're not all victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who took up the units in Iraq and soon left Afghanistan.
"Unless it seems that in the only way some can support us, it is to put us into the role of anxious souls."
This is very sensitive for military leaders who do not want to look ungrately or to show the public relations they serve.
They also realize that the wrath to which the units had to be brought back from Vietnam was much worse.
The result is that the centuries of words of mildness are discovered in silence and in particular between military veteranes.
When two sons of Colonel Mark Cancen returned from fighting action, where they served as a member of the sea pigs, their father warned them that people would look out of two corners for their service.
From the view of some, they will feel respect and respect because they have struck the enemy resurrected and visited exotic places.
But to others, he'll turn his head, if "under the surface doesn't cover a bad, violent veteran," said Cancian, who was struck with wars in Iraq, and after returning to Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for work, some people who were talking with him were unfortunately indicating whether soon after returning to battle, they could deal with the stress associated with the work in Washington.
"When you're talking about your service, you have to count with negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
Inquiry of the military partly depart from the American lowliness to wars.
Success in the victorious field is only a few times of recognition in the country, which has only a small army and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is only a little own advantage.
"So as a nation we no longer appreciate military heritage as it was running for the Second World War," declared General Commander David Barno, who was a major American unit in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition of the political and public is focused mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
The soldiers are designed for the start of actions that have endured, the number of friends that have lost, or in the range of their hurt.
The Armageddon takes the growing pressure to strengthen the violation
This week will be decided whether 28 women and men against military will be initiated because of certain inactivity in the case of violence.
No, they are prepared for the complaint to give hundreds of other employees.
The first military class of Elizabeth Lyman was the night when his colleague from the Army was evidently violated 25 years and was on the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008, and she moved to the casier to the airport based Miramar north of San Diega. After a dinner with her friend, she reached her husband's unfruited boat with 12 birds.
He asked her if she could join her that they could drink a little in her room.
"I had a warning light in my head," said Lyman.
But the father of Texasan ignored her fingerprints.
No, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," she said.
"I would listen to my instincts."
She says that just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man went to her, gone her to bed and violate her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other staff or former military members will wait for a hearing verdict that could have a historical impact. This will be played in Arlington in Virginia and it will come to him on whether the accusation against the former Minister of Defense of Robert Gates and his preacher, Donald Rumsfeld, will be made before the court.
The accusation states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in combating the spread of violence in the army, which is in contrast with the establishment of military rights.
The accusation was given to Washington's lawyer Susan Burke, and the complaint party had 17 members at that time. However, during the following months, their group increased to 28 - 25 women and three men who claimed that they were violated or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army and that the military had occurred in investigation, accusation, and any harm for justice.
Burke states that he's going to the highest heads of the army, because the problem starts right at them.
"The Army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in the position that they can prevent the efforts to take measures against such actions?
Burke also stated that she had contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, of which many of them could be part of the other claims given in the future.
Her strategy: More than to collect all accusations in this case - she put all the flock into one box, as it says itself - gives complaints in several different cases, if it is necessary to avoid pressure.
The Defence Minister of Defence is a member of the State representative of the United States of Neil MacBride, which, together with its cooperation, has contributed to refusing the case.
The newsweek's court documents detailedly deal with the strategy of dealing - in principle, it is that the current or former soldiers cannot complain the army for hurt that they suffered as members of armed forces.
In accordance with Regulation of the High Court of 1950 called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for hurt that the soldiers suffer in active service.
"Frequent hurts are related to military services of complaints," it is written in the document.
The Ministry of Defense has refused to express this matter.
However, since the fifty years, the elders have changed.
Although women still do not have any official service in the fight, it is only a wordbook: in modern wars, it is only difficult to find the front line given.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams played a more significant role, especially in communicating with civil women in the war area.
Consequently, between these wars, 150 women's soldiers fell - two thirds of them directly in battle.
It was time to come to modernization in the army, explaining Burke.
It's not alone in her fight, but it'll kill three other legal representatives.
At Yale's legal school, visitors of the veteran seminar on the legal services of claims on four main military academy for the cruel development of the atmosphere that supports women's hatred.
Unlike that, the unexpected organization of the American Vietnamian veterans is deploying the funds for its complaint against military. This claim is focused on the diagnosis of "personal pollution", which was particularly found in the victim of violence to have an army inclined to release them - according to the activists, such as Anu Bhagwati's party to a group of human rights Service Women's Action Network, it is absolutely a practice.
Her group has already made a complaint against the State organization for the negotiation with veterinarians, which is committed from discrimination practices to which the application of assistance from persons who claimed that they were sexually attacked in the service.
In Congress, nine self-determinations were presented, which a group of senators and missions of both political parties had submitted and provided a number of correct measures in them.
According to the Office for Prevention and Solution of the Sexal Violence of the Defense Minister, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains uninformed in cases and, according to Pentagon's own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated number of 19.000 incidents that occurred in this year.
In the report issued in March, there is also a decrease of the penalty of the suspicious: In 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army - which is half of the exemption of the civil justice system.
In the case of the representative of Burke, appeals are described as the first of the whole series of traumatisms.
For example, the first military of Lyman's class reported that the military police violation had not been a hour after it had to come to him.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat the details of her violation to 11 times different members of police, doctors and leaders.
She understood all investigations necessary to determine violence and the blood of an attacker was found in her bed - from the blood that she made for him.
At six months later, in April 2009, Lyman's hearing before the court, during which it was questioned whether she was loved by her friend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were invited who, as witnesses of story, were pronounced in the benefit of a given pachate, who finally was disappointed by the fault.
"I'll take myself on the day when the judgment was made," says Lyman.
"I had to feel that right there in the place of birth -- with a cry, I went out of the courtyard."
"They placed me on a psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember that I said to my biggest duty, "This was not his judgment, he was my."
The Lymans ordered to visit a military psychiater, who finally affected the disorder of personality, which indicated it as an injustice to the service.
In January 2010, military was released without honour and, therefore, without demand for the debt.
Whether the case of Lyman and the remaining complaints is moved to another stage or not, it's a run on a trace, says John Turley, a professor of the right to the Right University of George Washington.
Of course, he notes, "From my view angle, they should be able to deal with another stage of negotiation."
However, between them and the verdict, a mentioned doctrine has been criticized since the first moment, watching the light of the world.
I'm the entire life critical of the doctor of Feres Doctrine.
The Army is a few decades behind, because their obligation is not allowed to maintain the same measure of motivating enterprises and disturbing clusters.
She adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try it."
It's just going to change when good people will be willing to fight.
In the hearing decided in their benefits, Burkevoa, lawyers of complaints, keeps hundreds of others prepared to give a complaint and continues to work on other cases relating to this subject.
"We will not stop with the army in this question to fight where the reform does not come from," he says.
Or until we die, according to what's going on before.
The wall has eyes: How do you look at Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of the right extremism in Europe, he was only another young man who presented his anti-private views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who was admitted to the murderer of July after which 77 died in Norway, participated in his first public audience.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was not absolutely single in the cyber space: during the preparation of an attack, he was chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who supported the rights group on social networks.
After the tragedy of the year, they want to learn more about these people.
But how's it going?
Easy - enough to go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not really so hard to get them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of the recent reports of the British research team, which had been related to European Digital Populism.
The principle of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett that it was enough for the doctors to easily use the advertising on pages and, thanks to this, they determined a demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for a whole year.
Bartlett's team throughout Europe has found half million right-group fans, thus focused on them and sent them insults, but instead of calling them to a new emergency group or offering them a new diet product, they invited them to fulfil the questionnaire in which questions about the level of their education, the relationship with violence and optimism have been raised in view of their own future.
In the middle of Facebook with Bartlett and his colleagues, the results of more than 100,000 fans of 14 different rights groups in 11 European countries - unless they have to leave the office.
"It's a completely new way to carry out research," recalls Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online groups of rights are generally young men who are increasingly involving.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more intelligent, democracy and less violent than those who remain on the screen computer."
The DEMOS team work is only one of the examples of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of doctors.
Experience teams, health teams and political researchers use these pages to study all, from health problems to social trends which cover status updates, breath contributions and pressure buttons "I love".
Facebook reports more than 800 million activists. Each of them each day provides three different data, which from this social network makes the term "information supernovation", which is based on the development of many new research. The beginning of akademical work in which the word is shown Facebook has increased the status for about 800% ago.
For some teachers, Facebook's kitchen is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to be forced somewhere on the street.
"Previously, when you wanted to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them."
"You should get to the side where you would never leave," she says Bartlett.
"All this Facebook rejects - you just go directly to them."
Others say that the page can offer a way to identify the social and health problem and avoid them.
In recent study of Dr. Megan Moren's University in Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discovered their opile outcomes on Facebook were far more threatened by alcoholism than students who were silent about this subject.
Morenna suggests that the types of students of the page monitor and come with a offer to the student who publishs too many opile statuss.
"Problem can't be resolved if you can't make it," says Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, together with Dr. Moren and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development of Children's Research Institute in Seattl.
"We found a way to identify the threatened kids that wouldn't have been able to discover."
Facebook is still studying the data of his owners.
The information team was developed in relation to related statuss and the day of St. Valentin, elections in 2010 and the coefficient of the satisfaction of the people (in particular with the use of information to which they had access - the websites of freedom already stated that the website had its information facilities to access to research and the final).
But Facebook members think that it's the page that they like it or not - exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is a thousand miles away, it is necessary to provide your personal information on the page.
But what if Facebook people become part of the research they don't even know?
Scientists have a limited rules on how to simplify data off-line. However, online data are available to everyone.
"I don't think that they could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociolog in London Knowledge Lab, about the study of 2006, which he conducted with the use of the public facebook walls of his students.
"When it was about them, they took it so that there was only information between them and their friends."
The following is to consider the question of methodology.
Even in offline research there is no guarantee that the entity is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is not possible to verify how large parts are information on the profile and the contributions on the wall of the truth.
"What you say on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook, it's two absolutely different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who has been conducting research for a long time, thinks that the complaint and writer will still remain with the best possible tool that can be used for research.
"When you go into the real world and talk to individuals, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"The joint research should be about society and community activities - and a lot of community activities still playing offline."
"Callow and Nillyd": Anders Behring Breivik's first public courting
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who recognized the decree of two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway during his first public audience in Osla, described himself as a war of "reply".
"I am a military leader in Norway's movement of opposition and among the Norwegian Temple Rivers," he declared before the court where 500 people were deceived.
"I'm telling you the Court of Justice because the mandate has made you a organization supporting hatred ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I know my actions, but I don't recognize any wine for them."
Judge Torkel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monology because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a podium from which he could report his opinions."
From the same way, he refused Breivik, who brought a ready word with him, to enable at the end of the hearing to celebrate his family victims.
Nesheim also commanded the police to keep Breivika in the obligation of the next 12 weeks, prohibited him any media in 4 weeks and announced that the competent authorities would have a full control over all his visits and all its correspondences.
The hearing took part of about 30 family victims and survivors.
Some have come into the idea that Breivik's ability to look in the eyes, others to make sure that he is held firmly under the lock.
All participated with the aim of moving the case to quick closing.
"I thought he looked cold and neilly," he said to the NRK commenter one of the survivor attacks.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I could say for myself that after what I saw and heard the suspect, I had psychic moved back a little further."
Breivik, in dark clothes and blue cravate, remained quiet and professional for the whole time of hearing. When you come and leave to the building without a view of present journalists and survive in the eyes.
Despite Breiviko's bizarre view that it is part of the "opposition" movement, the judge recognized that he was not foolish and noted that there was no evidence that he had the same partner.
Someone can be comforted that attacks from 22 June seem to be the work of one extremist and no group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the harm and harm that are still in minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I'd like to look like a creator, but it's not," said the family one of the victims.
"If yes, everything would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a film that moves to kin this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, people who compared him to Henry Ford started to be seen - and chose him for his geniality by the greatest modern finder.
For the recently repeated discussion of Jobs, which was designed for a special movie, which moves to cine this week, it will be for all the fans of the Apple company that his creatival mind was perfectly understanding business processes and workshops that stand for his products.
He was an accurate designer, image and self-called member of the hippie movement, but even the pepé organizer and a person who ships every detail in the smallest details - he believed that many businessmen suffered "predicting that the great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent product is still a long way of work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the Triumf series of computer fools, who discussed the lighting of personal computers, and played a unique, more than a hour talk.
At that time, there were ten years since Jobs was invited to leave Apple, and he had full hands of work with his new computer company NeXT, and he was not patiently viewed how a broad public will accept the Internet.
Finally, in the TV, only a short part of the whole Cringely discussion was used in the series, and about p-copies of interviews was traveled that they were lost in transport.
However, shortly after Job’s death, VHS copies were found in the repository garage.
Just this material, quietly concentrated, creates the foundation of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which moves to the selected cines this center and Thursday.
On someone who has heard his insults to provide longer conversations, Jobs acts so surprisedly that he can talk about his philosophy and business strategies.
And it also appears as a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the discussion, between the question and the answer will be a longer pause - 10 to 15 seconds thinking when it is to see how Jobs’ answers are perfectly thinking to be the most exciting and clearest.
It also appears when Jobs’ perfectionism is exposed to the surface, when Cringely's questions act incompletely and encourage him to reach more important problems and subjects.
The conversation has been drawn up before the era of P&R, iPod or iPhonu, and there is a huge prophecy in it when Jobs value what the final companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the deadly evaluation of Job's career, but on Jobs, which we see here as a respiratory shadow in the blowing of his geniality, is something syrical and inspiring.
He has his own view of how things can and should look.
No longer, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
Quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which are determined as a comment:
How he learned to conduct business:
"In the years of business, I asked me, "Why are you doing this?" And the answer was always the same, "Well, this is just what it's doing."
No one knows why he does what he does never thinks about business matters in deepness.
I tried it.
Jobs continues by describing his effort to simplify ethnicity in Apple.
He was completely deceived by the way the costs were mentioned - often started by the signing "standard costs" on their height could only be thought. At that moment, he decided to take his own road - developed a automatic tool that ensured that trade costs could be defined during a moment.
As he performed the wheel on the paper:
Jobs focused on the "Modrue box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a equipment that allowed people to get into the phone company and call freely anywhere in the world.
It was already written in the past, but Job’s surprise, when the Blue box describes as a tool of power, is a sign.
It explains how they tested with Wozniak using a pay phone, and during the conversation, they were allowed to connect from one AT&T network to another, while they used the largest number of satellites.
"Now, half a half times we've pulled this way around the world, so when we cried something to the pay phone, it's been called for a minute to start from the second phone at the door," laughs Jobs.
"We were young, and we found out that we could build a thing that is able to drive the infrastructure for billion dollars throughout the world."
We made two of us a little thing that could control a lot of more work - it was an incredible experience, and I think it would never destroy Apple without it.
Jobs continues to be described by the bridge that they and Wozniak had reached to the end. In the middle of the blue box in the night they called to Vatican and asked whether they could talk to the papa, while they were best published for Henry Kissinger.
The Catholic Church members were gradually invited to talk to the American diplomate at night, just before the phone was raised up a single papa, two were spent and listened.
How he was in love with Bill Hewlett:
When he was 12 and spent the replacement parts to be able to set a piece, he found a number in the phone list on Bill Hewlett and called him.
Shortly after their 20 minutes talk, Jobs had an annual brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"Incredibly influenced me, it was the only company I knew at that time, and she formed my view of what it really was and how it was to be with her employees."
Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the firewide research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "for the table computer that was ever made".
He was big like a coffee, he had a CRT monitor and I was in love immediately.
As a teenager in HP, I went up and up, I fought around the computer and started writing programs.
How the innovation thinks:
In some places, Jobs talks about how new products are thinking about.
At the beginning of his career, when he sold a couple of tables with flat connections, one client asked him to set up a whole computer.
He had only 30 payments days available during which he had to find out, install and add ready equipment.
When he was in Apple's company, he takes into account the problems they faced in the computer mouse development:
"I remember how we've been very funny... they cried to me that it would last five years [the mouse that would be 300 USD] when I stopped getting it, I went out and found a designer."
In ninety days of repair, we have been able to make a finally low mouse for 15 USD.
How the big company comes to breach:
A long time before he led the resurrection to Apple, Jobs probably predicted that many industrial leaders in his vision would collapse and lose their share in the market.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox company, so you're doing better copys or printers, well, and what's going on?"
You have a monopol market, so the company can't be more successful.
At this moment, the marketing is already governed, so companies lead people who are concerned just this, while people who are concerned about their own products are exhausted from the decision process.
Technological genius, which has led the company to its inappropriate position, is now replaced by people who do not have any idea of good or bad products - the quality and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in the Xerox company...
Xerox community could own the entire computer development.
She could be ten times more than it was, she could be Microsoft for ninety years...
However, in the place of winning, they have been able to go.
How it takes innovation as a form of art:
"It's a long way between the excellent idea and the excellent exhibition product and the long way of work... and as the great idea is developed, it's also changing and growing."
During that time, you're learning much about him.
You have to access a series of compromises - some things just electronics, glass, robots or companions do not accept.
You have to have a memory of 5000 things - different concepts - and put them into the...
Finally, you're trying to think of the best things that mankind has created, and in a certain way you're trying to put them into what you're doing.
Picasso said the good artists are copying, but the best artists will steal.
I've never been worried about my best ideas.
Macintosh community was so fair and successful because people who worked in it were excellent musicians, basic artists, artists, zoologists, history, and the best computer experts in the world.
Without being computers and new APIs, they would be able to do things in fully other sectors.
Scalia and Thomas divorced with the repayment of the law of health care at the time when their case was in charge of the court
On the day when the High Court set out at the closed doors to negotiate a political controversial question, whether we would accept a meeting against the law of the President Obama's health care, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and chairman Thomas, attended the celebrational dinners sponsored by a legal company that would be before the judgment.
The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges arrived to discuss the issues given.
One of the issued cases was charged by 26 states who doubt radical health care processing, which loni approved the Congress - the law that mobilised to conservate activists throughout the world.
The judges agreed that they would hear the complaint, but in March there are 5,5 hours of negotiation, which will also increase the results of the presidential elections planned for 2012 and at the time of the decision will be in full course.
The right which is standing before the court and will try to achieve the rejection of the law will be with the greatest probability of Paul Clement, who served as a general prosecutor of the United States for the Government of George W. Bushe.
The Clement's legal company, Bancroft PÃ©C, was one of the nearly two tuckets of companies who helped sponsor the annual dinners of the Federalist Society group, which has already been a longer period of conservation principles.
Another company, who sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations of doubting laws, including the National Federation of independent business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical gygant Pfizer Inc for which they are in the process in a major financial cup.
At night, she was at the Washington hotel a few hours after the court debate on the subject of the case mentioned.
She participated, other than Mitch McConProperty, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate and the confirmed repayment of the health care law.
And the guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: these two judges with the Federalist Society's group's action for all years.
And, of course, it's not about anything that would be in contrast with the ethics rules.
These judges are devoted to comply with the principles of behavior which are subject to lower federal judges.
However, their behavior would certainly be under the principle of C4, which says that "the judges may be able to take action that are rightly associated and other organizations are ordered to obtain financial feeds, but the judge must not be a speaker, a honest host, nor should it be indicated on the action programme."
However, the relationship of Scalia and Thomase with two legal firms in the case, and also with a major financial interest in this case, was rich enough to save the activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking destruction of ethics and lowliness towards the code of behavior is in contrast with the establishment of some judges that the highest court is acting in accordance with the same rules which are paid to all the remaining federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The Courts have bought and dinnered for community benefits together with the legal representatives who wait for the negotiation of their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining financial rubbers through this action undergrounds the feet of all undertakings of unemployableness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown their critics only a wide understanding and have shown them that they also combine their judicial obligations with group action, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is highly designed to conservate an activist.
Moreover, the conservators suggest that the ethical problem is mainly judged by Elena Kagan and none of Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for the Government of President Obama when the first trial against the law had occurred before the court.
Kagan's critics pressed her to say to the case, and she claimed that she was fighting for the law so much than that she could not be asked now.
Kagan's nobody indicated that she wanted to go away.
Boeing community obtained a recording prohibition for aircraft in 18 billion USD
Aerolinks Emirates in the area of 50 bicycles Boeing 777 airports with the possibility of buying 20 other.
Boeing also sells six years of Boeing Dreamliner links to Aman Air, for which he incases more than 1 billion USD.
When the company gets a negotiation for 50 cuts of its products, it is not a deal to celebrate.
However, this company is the Boeing Co Airport producer and the price of these 50 years is making a record of 18 billion USD, it is something else.
The same important report is from where Boeing has received a prohibition from: Medium East, growing the golden lot for the future aircraft negotiations.
According to the suggestions issued on Monday, the Chicago Company considers that the links at the Middle East will need 2 520 years at 450 billion USD in the next 20 years.
The Boeing company announced its biggest negotiation in the history about the dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 two-country Boeing 777.
Since the decree came from the Emirates seat line in Dubai.
The Boeing company on the field 2011 Dubai Air Show notified that Links have the opportunity to buy other 20 airports, so the total value of the prohibition would be exposed to 26 billion USD.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air seven cars were negotiated with Boeing 787-8, sometimes also called as Dreamliner, which was very better to use fuel and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six years exceeds 1 billion USD.
"It's about an excellent message for the whole Boeing company," said Neal Dihor, an analytic for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific clients is very high."
A lot of lines on the Middle East belong to the more difficult peoples of the Middle East.
This means that it has not only money for the payment of aircraft, but the growth of the prices of the weight - most damaging links, because it's about one of its largest costs - it's not so determining, because the country's alone on the highest prices of the growth is produced.
It is important because they are not as probably as in other letters that they can make or delay aircraft charges from the increase in the fuel price, says Dihora.
"They have so natural protection," he says.
The prohibition from Emirates is complying with Boeing's leading position on the market with a broad airport and brings it into the difficult company Airbus SAS, which was trying to refuse Boeing's dominantship with its A350 model.
The victory of Boeing comes four months after Airbus's representatives noticed that the first year of their largest airport A350, which is the direct competitor of the airport 777-300ER.
It was declined because the clients requested more useful aircraft and aircraft, so the manufacturer took time to add machines to the engine.
The Boeing Co share price increased by 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
Mexican president's sister was deceived in Michoacan elections
Louisa Maria Calderon states that her counterfeit, Faust Vallejon from Pri, helped a drug buyer in the moon for the crystal for drugs.
Sister Felipe Calderon seems to have been spent in the violent state choices on the poster in Michoacán. On Monday, she declared that one of her anti-victors helped the buyers of drugs.
Previous outcomes were judged by the leading in the west of Faust Valley's options by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The principles of the members of the organized crime in the whole election process and, in particular, in the past yesterday's elections are alarming not only for Michoacán, but for all our country," said Louisa Maria Calderon in a discussion on a day after the weekly elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the Group for Public Reviews... they enjoyed election urnes, made roads and allowed people to vote for the Pri.
The Prie party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when the presidency came.
However, it plans a quick return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacan is a important step in this effort.
The Prie party hopes to win in July in the presidential elections.
It seems Vallejo's hurt Calderon, who has done a day before the elections, just very close.
Calderon, the candidate for conservation by her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejona as a winner.
The third place was Silvano Aureolis, candidate on the left side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has done soon controlled the Authority. For the exhaustive and strictly investigated side, the presidential elections in 2012 are to be a very adversity.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, an ex-country officer of the State called Morelia, rejects and invites the final candidates to recognize results.
Michoacán was controlled by drug cartridges specializing marihuana, heroin and metamphetamine.
It was the family state of President Calderon and just in Michoacán, in 2006, military fight against buyers.
However, violence endured.
Ancient of the PAN, Colonel Luisy Marie Calderon, was killed only a week before elections, and many candidates from the elections left out of fear.
However, if the outcomes of elections in Michoacán look for the Pris, the victory of the side will help to get a new impulse.
The expected representative of the Pri in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Neto, from Wahington Valley, welcomed and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraged because of the overcoming year."
The ADB bank invites Asia to help save the Euro
The Bank of Asian Development invited India and China to be prepared for aid to save Euro'na from its commitment to debt crisis, otherwise, it could reach a global decline of the world's economy that would have a negative impact on the growth of economics in Asia.
Rajat Nag, the ADB bank's general manager with the Side in Manile, said that two most growing economics in the world must "do all that is in their powers", to help them to deal with a monetary block through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] followed all European movements "too uninterrupted" and declared that Asian financial assistance in combination with European guide and helped to bless global economy.
"We're all together."
"So everyone who could help Europe from the crisis," said for Financial Times during the discussion on the World Economic Forum in Bombai.
"Asia may be protected in certain ways, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should decide."
The European Monetary Association has been tried along a few months of difficult trial for a long crisis.
In recent days, the exemption costs of Italy were dangerous, and the presidential governments Italy and Greece have fallen away.
The growth debt crisis in Europe was afraid that the global economy could be restored to the recess, and it started to reveal the calls to renew the innovative economic connections and helped Euro to find solutions.
Mr Nag foretold that all Asian support would be directed by IMF, but he noted that the distortional aid - such as the purchase of the Financial Aid Fund, the institution for European financial stability - would provide more negotiation options to the Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, Indian Ministry of Commerce, said that "India will do what will be powerful" to help Euroone, because her own economy is now suffering by the reduction of exports and increasing the attractive effect of relief.
"Nobody wants the Euro to remain stable and insane," he said.
"We're going before a hard job and we must keep a high growth. "
"It's not an alternative, it's a bad fact, because how different they could find employment for ten millions of our young men and women."
Others suggest that economic developments, such as this, do not have anything to help European economics when they are required to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor of the Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to explain aid for Europe 1,2 billion people of India when 800 million of them live from 2 USD or less daily.
"The Greeks could be able to go to the arrival in fifty-five, and they would have been allowed to use on the beaches, which would probably be difficult to explain to them," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, doubted about why Indian resources should be used to maintain a good payment of employment for many Greek citizens in wrong-handed and lost sectors, such as railway transport.
Mr. Nag highlighted that the crisis of the Euro's is threatened by the dangerous dominant effect.
The bank's predict that between 2011/2012 and 7.5% of economic growth in Asia, now the "reduction risk" of Europe's threats is being held.
He declared that the vulnerable development markets must create "unprevisible expenditure plans" to be protected from the decline and significant exemption of their economy.
Warning from Pentagon regarding possible defenses
Leon Panetta Defense Minister, on Monday in Congress, was strictly added to the cattle when he warned that the risks of auto-countries in the budget could threaten national security and call for a financial road reaction starting in Pentagon and continued through the battle in Afghanistan to civil montage lines.
The Pentagon will have to take this way to reduce the budget by 450 billion USD during the next ten years, but now it is afraid of further 600 billion USDs if the Congress cannot conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The effects of these sticks would be destroying for the whole resort," Panetta wrote in the letters to Senators John McCain, Aríbana, and Lindsey Grahams, South Carolina.
He said that the incapacity of the Congress reached the budget agreement, and from that emergency, that would cause 23% of the poor reduction and stoping many new projects.
"For such a huge decrease that is used in this inevitable way, where possible to carry out our building or ship projects - you can only buy three quarters of buildings or ships. Moreover, it could be a serious damage of other modernization efforts," said Panetta to Senators.
"Before we will need to separate many of our civil employees, and since the decrease is to continue so, we will also have to send civilisms to the needed allowance, and they have been able to fulfil the target requirements."
"These changes can be distorted with the faith of those who care for our army and seriously hurt her preparation."
Finally, they'll touch the battle units, he announced the Panet.
"Although the funding of potential war operations in the ocean will not be directly affected, further operations will be negatively affected by serious changes in the final budgets," Panetta warned.
"It comes to the ships and in the contractual staff, which will be the result of the late end of contracted contracts supporting the military efforts of our people."
"The status of employees will be decreased, from which the payments to the suppliers and the successful violations of legal and political support will be made."
Both Senators replied to Panett ten days ago and asked him for details about potential impacts on the auto-defense ministerial.
"The outcome of the defense ministeriality could cause degradation of the view of the United States as the world's military Majesty."
"We are strictly against this strong measure," the Senators reported in the joint statement on Monday when they published the Panet's letter.
"It's not about the conclusion they could live with, and we do not want to sign ourselves."
"The planned sticks are a threat to the national security of the United States, which should not be allowed."
"The Panett's letter and healthy warning will first be seen if the pressure on the Congress will be increased and strengthened by the votes calling for the release of Pentagon from the list of covered pigs.
Panetta was last in discussions on potentially opening, even though he himself passed to his high position in Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he concluded that he would go to this battle.
On the printing of a minute of a week, the Minister of Defense indicated a structural image of what his resort can wait - a shortcut of the army, which will be in the mistake of the nuclear.
"Be like a ship without mariners."
"Be as a brigade without municipality."
"I'll be like a flight without school pilots."
"By as a paper tiger, like the army of cazar, buildings and bombs without sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the speaking in Pentagon.
"Be as a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to equippe the enemy."
"In the result of this will be welcomed to the aggression..."
In the Annex added to the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how to be reduced as follows "evident operational risk: latest reaction to crisis, conflicts and disasters; extreme restrictions to the possibilities of leadership and seating throughout the world; predicted unacceptable risks in future war operations".
In addition, the Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could wait for the end, including those already tested, and those who are just in the early stages of planning.
In the list, for example, the F35 aircraft project, planned by a new bombarder, the Balistic pools of a new generation, the new coast fighting ships and the new earthly warfare vehicles, which wanted the army and the sea pitch to replace humvees.
By stoping the further development and testing of F35 aircraft, 80 billion USD would have been avoided during the next ten years, but its stakeholders claimed that it was necessary for a further step to improve the army, which is necessary to cope with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to divorce lies
A late view of recent newspapers indicates how serious and all of them are lies and claims in every day.
The Republican President's candidate Herman Cain has full hands of work with accusation that he sexually charged a few women - both sides say that the second lies.
The administrators at the Penn State University were accused of a false witness when they tried to hide the records of the sexual attack of a pen-bal trainer.
Last week, the French president Nicolas Sarkozy was approved as the launched microphone calls the American President Barak Obam that the Israeli president of the government of Benjamin Netanyah is a liar.
It was able to destroy the entire career and to include the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and Anthony We's Internet exhibitionist made a deal when he published information that was soon returned by undesirable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of delaying the funds from his campaign to try to deal with his unmarried situation.
And no one will never forget the median circle that broke around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in a matter of his sexual injury with Monica Lewins.
Everywhere it's just deceiving the stories of undergoing at school and at university.
There are cases when the factors themselves give their students a test answer only to look well in their trials.
Mentors who have to make a repair are sending a message that lies and underways are acceptable.
How much underwater do we meet?
See shows that on one day you're going somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let us imagine that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that foreigners were lost three times during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life.
The definition of lies, or the "rekening of lies", is the need for everyone to win, either from personal or works.
However, there is no community game that would be similar, let's say, Shadrad, when man will say, "I have you." The recognition of the claim is a seriesous sector that works with decade data stored during the last six decades of the pressive universities through detailed research projects, especially in psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that the percentage of old myths of lies was rejected.
He's lying to you quietly say in your eyes.
It's not so they're getting tired, cooking, red, or swimming.
However, do not export from the fact that it is difficult to observe and discover.
The educational identifier of lies can be able to discover the truth of the famous buildings, detailed expressions in the face, the way to make questions and their time.
I have been working for a few years by sharing decade knowledge from a comprehensive and developing sector regarding the recognition of lies and it is that discovery of claim is a modern skill that can be easily learned and in today's complex world can help you very much - especially if your work and obligation belong to the name, management of conversations, negotiation or management of people.
Good liars can read well and in the ends, let them be watchful, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side is accepted.
From research, we know that extrovertis are more frequently liars than introvertising that men do more "autocentral" lies, while women say more lies "related to the end" - most often to protect some feelings - that marriages are less often liars to their partners than free people (which lies say, truly "unfair").
We also know that if you are pronounced as a sinner, the final feels less provoked when they lie to you.
How do you know someone lies?
First, observe the normal behavior of the entity.
It's called "start observation".
He will have more recent discovery to compare with.
Take care of the body of the entity, his smile, his work with the voice.
You should be able to think if someone runs away with the feet so that you don't accuse him unrighteously from the lie only because the meetings will begin to swallow his feet.
Then try to determine the slides of false verbal and non-black behavior.
Nevertheless, take it as a warning sign, not as a evidence of lie.
People who spend the lie can stop moving the top half of the body when they are trying to remember their thought story, the bottles can turn to the door, move up to the east, change the body's dress or give the "left after talking out" - overwhelming efficient respiration and change of positions when a difficult response is behind them.
People are running conversations often issue a fake signal that interview is at the end, just to see how the goal will look after it is finished.
Take the language of the entity too.
It's fair about how Scott Peterson's ever rejected and used the past time when he claimed that his murdered woman is alive, and that has spread up the whole country's career after her body.
They can also express a delicate expression: "I had no sexual relationship with Mrs. Lewinski" or they got the question again.
The most current verb characters are only very inconsistent.
Someone can use a lot of "smiling language" when he answers the question, "Well... to say the truth... of what I know... according to my best house."
In such an answer, we will not know too much of facts and often refer to another warning signal.
There is no cup that can be discovered by every lie, but it is possible to win the power that can be liared.
Helping these powers will have a greater opportunity for humans to find personal and workless liars and undergoing.
Controversial plan for the exhibition of ships will be passed after the threat of the approval by the US Government has occurred
A few days after Obam's Government threatened that he would reject the approval of the planned chairman from Canada to Mexico City - which respected the committees against himself, but quietly disturbed the environmental - the company who had an effort to take care of it noticed that it was willing to move the project so that things would be returned to the movement.
The TransCanada company announced on Monday evening that he would move the planned road to travel from the ecological sensitive Sandhills in Nebrasce, and it was convinced that the project would also be approved.
The company notified this Decision at the printing of the Nebrahian Government.
TransCanada Alex Perbax's staff claims that the company is convinced that the building of the puzzle will finally be approved, although it will lead another road.
This announcement came after the last week the Ministerial Ministry stated that it declined the decision on the federal authorisation of the project, from which it did not conduct a study of potential replacement routes, which could not be involved in Sandhills in Nebrasca and in the aquatic level of Ogallala, a clear underground water resources.
"This is the real move in front," said the Republican Representative Lee Terry from Nebrasky for Fox News.
The new ecological review of the Ministry will probably take place any decision until 2013, then the year after elections in the next year, but the authorities refuse to play a political role in the decision.
Both in the written statement of the last week described the decision as a request for the Ministerial Ministry and issued its support to him.
1 700 miles of long troops will connect Canada and Mexico.
From Albert's province to Texas' raffinery I daily protect 700 000 bars of rubber.
This will be the way to fight six States.
This project hates the environmentalists, but it loves the work of the chats that believes that 20,000 new jobs are opened in the work of the work.
However, the legislators in Nebrasca set up against this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would cause the company to not enter into the region of Sand Hills and in the waterful level of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and inflation.
The study on the ecological impact that the Ministry negotiated has assessed that the project would only have a detailed negative ecological impact, but the resource from the energy industry said that the General Ministry Inspector had negotiated a new review of the whole process of a ply-studi, and focused mainly on two questions.
One time it was whether the lobbyist found by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was the adviser of Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not represent in the conflict of interest.
Next, whether the company invoked to conduct a ply study was not chosen unfairly because she had linked to the TransCanada company.
Patti LaBelle is accused that the bathroom was rejected for her.
The New York family claims that the song of Patti LaBelle had soon entered their home of Manhattan and feared their daughter so that she was disappointed from that fear.
The outcome of the song hit "Lady Marmalade" feared the eighteen months Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "a change of personality, a disturbance of sleep" and "increased fear of foreign people", states her family in the complaint to the Most High Court of Manhattan.
On November 10th, Kevin Monk, his wife, Rosen, the teacher in the school, and Genevieves were chaosed for a family road.
When Kevin Monk arranged a car, Rosene Monk met down to their house in the Riverside Boulevard and took with her and Genevieve.
Rosen Monk said she stopped at the door on the ch'a, and she left her child at a moment.
"Nobody came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes" and I went to bring her up."
LaBelle's worrying to the pregnant woman.
"The aggressive tone said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter to the door," Rosen Monk said.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She's been kidding and started talking straight, and she's voting the most simple expressions...
She had a laugh with water with herself and started getting water after me.
He says Genevieve got histerical inhibition.
"I said to the woman, "See what you did to my daughter."
LaBelle was on her mother - who still had Genevieve in her hand - and had to stop her until her delivery, which later took her away into a waiting car, told Rosen Monk.
The daughter had so much to run when she returned, she added.
After that, the family sent a letter in which LaBelle asked for excuses, but they didn't answer.
LaBelle's songs and speakers don't respond to our phones so that they'll get to the whole box.
The claim requires nearly unexplained, but the family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free and that the family plans all exhausted money for charitable organizations with child with cancer.
"I intended to offer Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for its start," said Davis.
"This behaviour is absolutely inappropriate, especially if it's intended to be against the student of the school holding in the hands of eighteen months child."
Unfortunately, the climate has distorted the economy
During the first year of the Government of Maria Lópeze Valdez, the unemployment and unemployment increased in Sinaloa, reduced investment and economics with them
In 2011, it is written to the economic progress of Sinaloa. It is the first year of the Government of Maria Lópeze Valdeze, which is called a government of changes. This government has brought a great expectation with herself regarding economic progress, however, from the degree of unprecedentable climate submissions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been mentioned and has even reached the decreasing of the main economic development indicators.
Low winter temperatures have caused million losses in agriculture, have limited the possibility of growth in the state economy, have awareness of the reduction of the economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year, which has reached historical reduction by 31.16%, which has distorted dynamic and other economic sectors.
According to the reports of the caused damage issued by the Mexico Council for sustainable development of the foreign, damages were mentioned to 582 835 hectares processed by ground, from which 78.03% was completely destroyed and at the remaining 21.07% were discovered by part of damage. The mainly destroyed fruits belonged to greenine, sugar and games.
The reduction in economic activity until November caused constant growth of unemployment in the State. According to the National Institute for Employment and Logo, the non-employment measure in the first three quarters of the growth. From January to March, 55 053 people of the Sinaloa were not employed, which represented a rate of unemployment in the amount of 4,53% of the economic activity population. In the second quarter, the unemployment increased to 5,28% and between July and March, the average non-employment continued to grow and reached 6,19%, which represents approximately 74,000 non-employed persons.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard Lópeze Cervantese, the UAS Factory of Economic and Social Affairs is possible to explain the growth of unemployment indirectly based on steps conducted at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of growing unemployment, relating to different factors; among them is the loss of liquidity on the market from the limitation of resources in the light of the legislation which has approved the congress in relation to the fight against spending money. For people who are illegally forced by dollars, it is not easy to make them, invest them or use them for something," he said.
Stop
López Cervantes noted that the growth of unemployment also shared a demographic factor.
"The beginning of persons who go out for work in the farm, the United States, has decreased, however, from the deficiency of the income, and then also because, even though these people get outside the border, it is hard for them to get jobs, so people remain and require work from our state, and so unemployment grows," he said.
Insufficiency
Analysis of the work market in Sinaloa is also deteriorated from the growing inefficiency that controls the workshops. For the National Institute for the Democracy and 60.38% of the employees in the State, without taking the dose of social security.
The low payments of the labour market are added to the unemployment and non-effectiveness, such as the lower payments, which are the lowest payments from the whole country, as indicated in the registers of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Secretariat of Work and Social Planning.
The average monthly receipt of workers in Sinaloa was in September 5, 352 pieces, deeply under national dimension, which moves to parts of 7,375.
Return of direct business investments
In 2011, with the increase in economic activity and the growth of unemployment, the most significant reduction in the direct investment investment in the past 10 years was also made. According to the Ministry of Finance in the period from January to June, the investment of 630 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74% of the sales of 5 143 312 dollars for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry for Economic Development of the State provides investments in 17,280 million pess per year, which focused mainly on businesses in service.
Double
In the context of the reduction of the economic government of this State, the State congress requested in July to approve a loan of 3 billion weight, which would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 cities to live in economic. The local congress approved a loan in 2 600 million weights. No profits were changed until November, and it was not in any sector of the State economy.
Reaction
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Maria López Valdése showed the lack of government ability.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Common of Transformation, declared that in 2011 there was a failure to solve the will of individual sectors, including the governments of the State.
"The diversity of the economics in Sinaloa was truly intimate during this year. We have to work intensely on it, and we have returned to the land we lost in the year. In 2012, we have to double effort, we have missed the harmonization of our efforts to all, especially the right and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let us hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic weakness
Loredo López noted that the events as a fraud at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a variety of tasks, otherwise. One of the main results was the degradation of the economic that was not enough to remember to re-speak dynamicity that would allow to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, we experienced deeply under expected prospects at the end of the year."
Redefinition of transmission
According to the Teo -- Salazara Uriarte, President of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, it is necessary to affect the state of more dynamic production activities.
"We generally note that it works, and we believe that it is necessary to prepare a plan that would be defined again the objectives and economic focus of the State because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work that's before us
President Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a future view that would better lead to the efforts of the government.
"I would generally say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, in the economic development has reached some progress, but it is important to create a plan," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policies.
"There are elements that allow the government to claim that the government is trying to be priority. I can say that it is here to see a work made and I think the government is the fact that it is also a job before us," he said.
Adjudicated for 8 kg marihuana
The population of Navoato was sentenced to five years of procedure and 100 days of trial for eight kilos of marihuana.
The general procurement of the Republic informed that the dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. It was judged for a criminal action to health threat, particularly for the marihuana-materiane for trade.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by mexican army members on 7 June 2010 at the travel in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposed to the station 80 of El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer took a pick up white color in the supplier. In the car, he had a black bag in the cotton and a small bathroom. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of the marihuana 23 grams.
From these cases, a man insured remained available to the Court of the Second Section and the Administration remains internal in the Centre for the implementation of legal effects of criminal acts.
Project contributions debt
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, Saving public places and 3x1 for persons, are dangerous that they are affected to the end or that they will have great delays from the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of the City Social Development stated that if the building work has gone forward, it is now threatened that the Government of the State is able to ensure the relevant supplies required by over 11 million weights for three programmes.
He noted that the total investment in these three programmes is about 50 million weight. The State is 25%. Only the Federation and the city have been added to the end of the project.
"They have to ensure almost 12 million, and although the year is going to end, we haven't got anything, but even though we had to get part in July," he said, "and they didn't have time, we started projects and continued very hardly, but we missed money."
He noticed that in the latest year, Jesuse Aguilar Padilla State had not fulfilled the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, he had to ask the city for a payment for more than 7 million who had no State administration.
"The fair thing has happened to us in the past sixth period, because the state has no economic capacity to achieve and the programs have gone further. And this year we got to the mentioned programmes, we have had to get the cups that would cover what has not been done," he explained.
Despite the fact that there was a promise from the State representatives relating to the transfer of these resources, he noted that the request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary for Administrative and Finance to facilitate the management and the corresponding percentage was at first reached.
"They had to give us 12 million, and although the year is close to the end, we haven't reached weight yet."
The Court approves "the end of the analogue sending" in Mexico in 2015
Replaced analogue signals by digitals is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) refused the constitutional complaint submitted by the Senate and the Sender to the presidential decree, who wanted to accelerate the "deactivation of analogue signals" and to perform it in 2015 instead of 2021. He noticed that there were no needed eight votes that would not be applied to it.
At least four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his power when he issued a decree in which individual steps are mentioned, which would refer to the transition to the digital television.
With this exam, the claim granted by the Senate was rejected because the eight votes were not achieved in order to ensure that the court could be entitled to the establishment or incompatibleness of a mentioned decree that remains valid.
In the judgment of the Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero, the Decree has the possibility of reporting a decree as inconsistent, since regulations of all issues relating to the and television are the matter that is replaced by the Federal Telecommunication Commission (Cofetel). This is the way to violate the principles of hierarchic subordination and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero were voted for the project.
With this argument as Senat, the Missionary Summit supported the constitutional dispute in trying to fight against the decree. Minister Sanchez Cordero adopted the requests and stopped the implementation of the decree and all actions described in it, leading to digitalisation.
The Meeting of Ministers also decided to refuse the complaint given by the Latvic, without having entered into the debate on us, which is also concerned with the Ministry of Sanchez Cordero.
The Minister said in his committee that it does not comply with the arguments of the opinion in the meaning that federal executives cannot structure by the general standard of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if it had done it, it would have touched the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and he reminded that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunication sector is a federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the respect of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals digitally is one of the biggest changes that the world has experienced in the last years. It relates to better use of the radioelectric speech, better quality of the signal and more channels.
It seems that it would mean to separate changes from digitalization, which requires decisions in the matter of public interest, so digitalization does not only have technical dimensions but also "the economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he highlighted, these questions "require the operations of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of the State's economic control, which includes the entire number of competences that the Institute trusts in the Government of the State".
He recalled that a number of countries throughout the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and thus affected its governments, even though they had highly specialized technical authorities.
He noted that the Government could not be allowed by providing an unconcorded decree that contains in certain ways the powerful congress, leading to the administrative control of laws prepared for legislative powers.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of calculating "stem by voice"
According to the data published by PREP, the section between the first and the second place in the elections of the owner is 27 per cent. The votes 879 of 6074 optional circles were not yet calculated.
The possibility of calculation of " vote after vote" has been revealed in the aerodrome options in Michoacán, where, in accordance with the data published by the Previous Elections Programme (PREP), a division between the first and the second place in the electoral options of nearly 27 per cent, which has not yet been initiated by the vote 879 of the total 6074 electoral circuits.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Election Institute in Michoacán (IEM), Mary de los Angleles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that the electoral authority had approved a number of measures to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
As noted yet, Michoacán did not officially confirm his political establishment or its State election code or law on electoral justice, so the State congress approved reforms shortly before it had to expire the legal duration for their entry into force yet in this electoral period and helder Leonel Godoy Rangel recalled their publications in the appointed period of the Official State Instance Act, with the fact that he had an accommodation against them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) decided the establishment of the local legislative power initiated and announced the vote of the State's head in the case of the establishment reforms for "invalid and illegal", because it has no right to "approve or watch".
On the question of the option of counting " vote after vote" María de los Angleles Llanderal replied that by approval of appropriate measures by the General Council of IEM, the local electoral authority would be possible to carry out part and total calculation.
In this way, the partial calculation of votes, one or more election packages, can be carried out after the following submissions: optional results do not agree; there is no entry on the calculation of votes and calculation in the corresponding box, or no chairman is available to it; or if it has occurred in errors and clear distortion of election results.
Moreover, the total renumber of votes in all elections will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential victory of elections and the candidate is less or equal to one percentage point; and when at the beginning of the session, the representative of the party and/or the coal of the candidate at the other place shall be shown.
The total number of votes will also be possible when, after a proper summary, the difference between the probably winner and the candidate is equal or less than one percentage point and also when there will be a statement request for a political party whose candidate has completed in the second place. In that case, election packages will be drawn out in which part of the calculation have been performed.
It is necessary to mention that such options are located in Morelia, where the PREP is divided between the first and the second place of 0.16%, even though 129 of the total 923 electoral circuits were not yet counted.

In the middle, new Italian government will be named
The named President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet the Italian President to present him a new government that will lead to a crisis that holds this country over the loss of economic disasters.
The named President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet the Italian President to present him to a new government that will lead to the crisis that this country holds over the loss of the economic disaster and which has brought into danger the whole euro.
The President's palace reported that Monti, named on Sunday, will meet with President Giorg Napolitano in the middle of the middle to confirm that he could create a government.
It is expected that it represents a majority of the technologies, although it is not yet clear when the new government is capable of enforcement.
Monti announced that he would represent the president's outcome of his discussions, which he led with political parties in trying to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to convince this phase," said the former European Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could create a government, but the tongue of his comments indicated that overcomes were convinced.
"The frame is now well indicated," added.
Monti has completed the process of establishing the government within three days, so much shorter than it is usually, while Italy is trying to fight against political and financial crisis, which has exposed to an insufficient level.
The new administrative conducted by the former European Commissioner Montim must approve a strong package of emergency measures required by European leaders, which will only be able to renew the confidentiality of Italy.
In Monti, a large pressure is developed to accelerate. For the stability of the markets, the amounts of the Italian BTP debts with the decade of 7 percent limits, the level where Greece and Ireland have to request salvation.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Organization of Employers of Confindustrie, said to journalists after meeting with Montim, "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this flat.
Montiho na · succeeded was expressly discovered by the support of the PDL Silvia Berlusconi, whose crisis had been provoked on Sunday to reject.
"We believe that the effort of Professor Montiho is intended for good investigations," she said to the journalists Angelina Alphano, the secretary of the Mediterranean.
The PDL support, the largest Italian parties, is important, since until this time, a number of members of its members have been established against the Government with the technology that Monti is building.
Support of the Parliament
The new Monti Government must have a strong support to Parliament in order to promote non-annual sustainable reforms.
Any interruption or delay in that effort could be called for a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian banking association added to pressure and warned that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started on Monday negotiations with political parties, committees and business groups, young and female organizations.
As long as the negotiation ends in the attack last night.
Monti was appointed by the president of Napolitan on Sunday, which enabled a very positive process to respond to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of the last week, when the Berlusconi had already been seen by demission, the rates of Italian duty returned to the critical border and thus reacted to the uncertainty of the new president of the Government to succeed.
To protect Italy, whose public debt is moved to EUR 1,8 billion, it would be over the possibility of the current financial reserves of the euro.
Monti announced that his government should maintain its power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general prognoses that claim that politics only give him time to implement reforms and then report the preliminary elections.
Monti noted that the policy would be initiated in its cabinet, but the large market party on the fact that this government should be solely charged by experts to bring Italy out of the disturbance of which the country has reached from the financial pressure.
Political resources have stated that the uncertainty of uncertainty and ungodliness between parties is complicating the efforts to join government and political personality.
Spanish international resources more frequently than Kosovo
From 22 Spanish Balalists, ten exceeds 50 international reserves.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 authorised players has grown up to number 50 feeds.
A huge contrast on the side of Kosovo, if we compare 22 players of both countries who have meet today on friendly trip at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
During the world and Europe, the number of a monthly FIFA salvation, has a wide scale between the elections of class A, Kostarika has only a dealer of Michael Uman, who played as the only 50 international reserves.
This number reached the last Friday at the Panamah station (0-2) at the stadium Rommel Fernández.
Spanish Balalists who play in the Eagle of Stars and in the powerful Clubs of the first disease, maintain the intensity of the activity in the campaigns and the households of the halls and atmosphere at high levels of European fires such as Champions League.
We also need to add experiences from the national Spanish team in complicated exhibitions on European and the world championate.
Costars players have very careful options for the drifts in ́i. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered as the lowest level in the FIFA.
We see that the largest number of Spanish representatives has on his account Iker Casillas, who was last Sabbath before England (program 0-1 in London) reached an ex-Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international challenges.
Casillas is still in the case today against Costa Rica and gets a new record for Spain - 127 international challenges.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelony, has on his account 106 bags.
Casillas and Xavi have been officially informed of the EUFA last week with other Spanish players who have hundreds of stocks on their account. In addition, Zubizarreta has already been mentioned with 126 and the medium attacker Schalke, Raul González, with 102.

Thereafter only 5 crossed the border of 30 ships: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Minimum number of stocks.
With less than 30 ships in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 stocks Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest hasn't exceeded 20 years.
While Nao Moreal has only four games and Jordan Alba two, Victor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson is still waiting for their first stock.
The best shooter of Spain is David Villa with 50 Ây and follows Fernando Torres with 27.
On the basic side, Brian Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Kvanteto included the country in its tour in the 20th year of celebration
"The way to Kosovo is a dream that becomes awesome."
In the exclusive conversation for Viva, Jeff Ament based on Pearl Jam said that the group was ready next Sunday to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the same group assures them that the possibility of playing in Costa Rica represents a full dream.
That's what the baset said and the founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South America continent in the tournee in the 20th year of celebration, and on Wednesday 20th, it will be a single stay in Central America.
This day will come from 19:30 to the National Stadium together with the English group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a show from the conversation that you will find the whole translation on the La Nation pages on the Internet.
You know what your fans enjoy?
The way to Kosovo is our dream that becomes aware.
In South and Central America, we were just underlying and adequate experience.
I was in Costa Rica just once, for the allowed, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to kill here for a few days.
So we have a great joy we can bring you our music.
I'm asking, because a group of letters are loved here, the fans use these days very intensely.
What do you say to your most swimming guests?
Thank you for standing with us so many years.
We've been almost 21 years before we arrived in Kosovo.
Some people talk about the concert already as the biggest show of the year.
Does it call you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've preached in the last 21 years have occurred in the horizon for a few weeks.
We preached a few great shows in Sao Paul and hoped that we had a concert for Costa Rica.
We really enjoy the concert.
We love this country, we serve, we like jungle, and for both activity, Costaric is the best country in the world.
How did you know Kostarica and her wings that are suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfair friends and a good friend living in Tamarindo.
My friends are going to surf in Kosovo or in Nikaraguy, or in Mexico. These are the best places for surfing, and so we have learned about Kostaric, through people who love surfing.
If we're looking at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Because we never played here, we have no restriction that we couldn't do.
We're going to make the best show with multiple tracks.We'll play a couple of songs from each album and present our fans a good and different repertor.
You're never repeating a repertorial.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 tracks and everyone has other tracks, so it's hard to choose what songs we'll play every night.
When we have two three songs we haven't played in the repertorium, we're focused on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked that and that we might have forgotten it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and I think it's more interesting for people.
You celebrate this tour 20 years of artificial roads.
When you look back, is it difficult to believe all that you have done?
Yeah, sure.
First, I think no one of us could imagine that we would be in one large rock group and we would stay in it more than 20 years, it sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and thinking we can still play together.
We've got it and we're making a music.
We're lucky to look at the place we used after.
We couldn't get better.
What did you mean that you were a significant part of the gender of gruggy?
It was always the honour for us that we could be part of this group, in which they have been entrusted.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice and Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when moving comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen too often.
Since time, a group will appear in the town, but it is much less habitual to take up five to ten groups from one city.
We're proud of it and we're honest that we can be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we're still playing with some.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We're happy that they're all our friends and it's our honour that we can be part of this movement that came up in Seattl.
It is also very unusual that the group as yours continues to be maintained and have the same members after these years.
Yes, we were four together 21 years ago and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is a longer time than the general duration of the group.
First, I think we're all happy that we're still in this world and the second plays our role is that we're still interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and we have been able to open a musical path that allows everyone to have sufficient freedom for his own experiment.
We believe each other, we appreciate the music of the other, and I think it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find the equality?
As we grow, it was a degree of how easier to find the equality.
We are trying not to eat too much on the tour, because it's very easy to fall into this cave of gifts and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come to music, you will remember that you have to respect music and what you have given them. You should not be allowed to deceive by being slave, rock stars. This is never really interested in us.
How do you focus on the next project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs, and at first it was something big.
As a cab, we had three years and never had any albums after Andy died.
It was very frustrating because it was so long. The most important is that we are now friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Gregem (Gilmore), who started in the capelle with us. When I listened to a song or looking at the song, I guess Andy, how incredible I was to be with him. It was always a joy to work with him, to smile, to enjoy music or lustball and many others.
It was an incredible person, and we missed much.
The National Chapel Las Roberts will be confirmed by starting the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Veder, and that's why you've chosen them as a pre-speaking?
Yes, the production sent us a few videos with them and this group was most liked to us, so we know what Las Robertas offers and must be very fun.
Why are you living changing Yellow Ledbetter's words?
That's the question of Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's sing her, and I think he adds the first thing he's gonna attack him.
Who affects you as a base?
It's like people.
I'm first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so much that I could talk about the bases I like.
How was Pearl Jam able to keep the gross, although it's not in the mode?
I think we've all felt easily separated from the words of the gruggy.
When the grug is told, I'll imagine the groups I mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the rests that came up at the same time. And if this music is valid today, it's something great because it's a music that's standing for listening to and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At the beginning, your music had an easily humor character and now it is more positive.
What's the matter of this change?
It's interesting because I feel that in the new album there are some tracks that are easier, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very humble, although they can be recognised as a positive.
At both of them, when Ed played me, I wept, and they're deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and have a trauma in life, you lose someone of your family or friends, these things will start to affect your art and music and these two songs for me just represent it.
I also think you can be a happy man and even make a fun music.
Peru:
Fuymori was again hospitalized for medical tests.
The former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in the public hospital, where the tests of the swallow loss that he suffered in the bottom of the bottom, informed his medical doctor.
The 72 - year - old Fuymori, who rejects the penalty of 25 years of freedom for human rights violated by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers some diseases, including the cancer of the language, which has been operated four times, and has already own doctors at the time under control.
Sender Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the TV station Canal N that Fuymori will submit tests in the National Institute of Displaced diseases, where they should see why he is sick and why the loss of powers in the bottom coasts.
Aguinaga said that, according to his opinion, Fuymori could have mercy from humanitarian deficiencies, however, the former president does not receive grace because he feels innocent.
Four times it was operated for the cancer of the language, he agreed 18 kilograms and other diseases were added to these problems as a difficult erosion of gastritis, a cystas on the slinder, a renal stone, a high pressure and the ambitious problems in the feet, called a doctor.
Fuymori has rejected the sentence since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, 25 years of death proceedings were sentenced to 25 persons who killed the murderer of the army who acted illegally in the first years of his government.
Music at the visit of Mexico to strengthen political commitments
The official delegation of the Uruguay president, José Mujica, which has been granted to some ministers and businesses, starts in a depressed visit of Mexico. Its goal is to achieve the expansion of trade between both nations and to touch the political issues of the region.
The music is in the middle of its mexican protest, Felipe Calderon, which is the most important meeting of the full meeting with the representatives of the political, trade and representatives of the Uruguay community living in Mexico. The Uruguay presidential office published.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between both countries," the Uruguay presidential office published at its websites.
According to local communications, Mujica will try to accept Calderón to support Uruguay in the contrary with France when the French president Nicolas Sarkozy organized a country of Southoame’s country on the list of tax collectors at the G20 meeting in the French city Cannes.
In his presentation, Sarkozy threatened that countries that will continue to keep on the position of taxes will be removed from the international community, which has called a refusal statement from Uruguay and a conciliation with the prosecutor in this European country.
Mexico presidents G20 since November. G20 is a group created by the most powerful developing and developing countries in the world. With the Latin-American country mentioned, it has concluded from January this year an agreement on exchange of information that will be prohibited by the two versions.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government is trying to specify a financial exchange agreement with the aim of obtaining the "Black Letter" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in which countries have not included all required international cooperation standards.
From Mexico and Uruguay, the free trade agreement (FTA) has been concluded since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between both countries.
Youathy installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario is already more than 25 years of war to save the princess Peach from Bowser's burns, but he has never seen in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl with the stereoscope.
Title that comes this month into all trades throughout the world has already been created since the beginning to use all characteristics offering a transmissive Nintendo 3DS console that allows playing three-dimensional games without using a brilliant.
"Mario is a position that must say how stereoscope is to work without bleeding," introduced the worker of the printing specialised at Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of video games in Madrid.
Alvarez noted that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Pr'a video game Nintendo created specially for this nose", since until this moment successful photos such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adapted to existing titles.
The Nintendo speaker noted that, besides that the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "Available" video game that allows it to use a → and gaseous party.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "single", whose task is to attach less handicap.
As soon as you convince this level, you can leave to the "three wheel" at the levels that are more advanced this time.
Moreover, they can choose a real time between "agressive D" or one who has only a depth of action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D so that it can be convinced of the most different challenges and "no delaying optical cloams".
This new approach of Super Maria in 3D also provides with the return of positions on a transmission console, which has not been reached since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays the notes of those who watch and repeat the successful formula from the previous parts. It means that the installer of a youth man will have to go through dangerous inmined platforms to free the princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in the surroundings, in overflows and also between enemies, it will also appear "playing" Luigi.
Colum approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced in the decree that he made steps in the issue of the former President Alfonse Portilla, which has to be responsible in the United States for the expense of 70 million American dollars.
This is the end of the process that Guatemala was aimed at responding to the request of a northern country, which requires the issue of Portilla to be able to judge it.
The pressure Colom confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judicial and executive power and that he remembered that the court has already ordered the issue.
He assured that during his mandate he was not "in" in court decisions and allowed all the issues that he received on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for murder and difficult health pollution and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trade.
The step of Coloms is a step to execute after all the courts and institutions have been excluded to conduct the process against the former president who was governed in the years 2000-2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Court of Justice and the Court of Constitution (CC), Portugal shall be issued after its laws in Guatemala and shall be ensured to maintain human rights.
Portillo was considered innocent in the case of 120 million in the Ministry of Defense during its presidency, but the Public Ministry was revoked and so returned to the game.
Trinium helped 6000 young people in a threatening state
The organization raised to help children without education so that they would not feel in the area of the company.
The balance of the first 25 years of the social aid organisation of Trinia is very important: 6.000 young people who threatened social exhibition have been given to help.
It must be added to the hundreds of jobs obtained for this social group.
The yesterday year also served to represent balances in the celebration Act which was played in the former production rooms of Fabra and Coats, which had been involved in more than 300 persons.
In 1986, Trinitat Vella was held in the fourth trinitat, with a view to helping young people with low education, without work, involving drug dependency or in social exhibition.
In the last meeting in Sant Andreu, a large number of representatives of the organization and institutions that cooperated in the past 25 years.
A diversified political representation, at election time, has shown the unique nature of the work that Trinia is performing.
Along with President Generalitat, Arture Masem, and his preacher Jordan Pujol, the former socialist adviser for education, Ernest Maragall, and the former age and the current ecological and socialist Council Ricard Goma.
In the large room of Fabra and Coats, the current adviser for social welfare and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of social work in La Ca, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinia had come up in a very difficult time and that today's a lot of overcome, but he added that the work that the association has brought to today is "good foundation".
The President introduced Trinia as an example of the possibility of fighting against an unprecedented circumstances and of giving courage to people in difficult circumstances.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work he does, I'm not new," he said.
Return to the house in which the gigantic festivals were organized
Each of the 13 apartments in Balmes building, 51
12 employees left the house yesterday without resisting
Everything convinces that the nightmare of the neighborhoods of number 51 in Balmes Street is finally at the end.
Twelve people willingly left the building that they were illegally inhabited and where they organized the gigantic festivals that were neighbors.
After the end of the operation, the closure on the door was changed to prevent the repair.
"From this moment, income will be guarded," said the manager.
Employers who took 11 of 13 apartments in the building - remaining inhabited - took all electrical and partly and water equipment, in addition to breaking the walls and left all sorts of waste, especially after alcoholic drinks.
In the first three apartments, a great party was held up to two days and spent the final salaries.
At the building, there is a discoteca, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press that after the construction of the building, the markets fell about 80%.
The drive holder highlights that the building occupants did no competition because they sold drinks for three euros, where the disketten is 10.
Furthermore, the owner of the enterprise had to react to the complaints of neighbors for the sound. But the problems did not affect the visit of the discotech, but the people of the departure of the house and, in particular, those who had been here on the ordered dinners, whose frequency and intensity has grown in the last weeks, according to divorced populations.
The owner of the discotech explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have forgotten them for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that during the last weeks she had received more stumbles from the neighbors to the date.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the City Group of the PP people on the Council, requested that "the building be moved immediately, and thus dealt with the problems of citizens' conviction that suffered by the neighbors and the destruction".
The president of the people explained that only one step has been prohibited before the year, but in the past months the accusers have reached all the fathers of the building and at all of the apartments, and in one of them even reached the cursing.
In this direction he added: "There must be associated with impatience and result in the effects of civil responsibilities that have been achieved in the building."
The city police also held a building in New Barris last night.
In 15 hours of 30 minutes, the police came to the building 35 on the Mont-Ral Street after they called her neighbors who saw entering the building four people.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
Architects have meet in the possibility of printing a procedure which takes more than a pole for the honorers
The city election procedure on 16 hours opens a debate on the role of Collserol park in Barcellona.
In the middle of the 1980s, in the time of the largest flow, Corporation Metropolitan de Barcelona (CMB), this self-subscription printed a few pamflets for the support of the Collserol park.
The flight defined the mountain as a big metropolit park of Barcelona.
Moreover, he was completed by digital comparison with the non-oral Central Park.
After the outcome of CMB in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many like the top border of Barcelona. The catalyst metropole is one of the small ones that are not oriented to the northern axes, but up (horn) - down (sea).
Collseroly Qualification as a natural park is in this direction.
References were already not Central Park, but Yellowstone with the whistles instead of Yogi's beauty.
This was the position until September, when the Board announced the mega concurrence of 16 competitions to the same amount of entrances to Collserola.
Of course, the brain burns more thoughts of the park.
Be this, or someone's trying to put the door on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or hour?
During competition, as well as purely organized, as well as on the basis of the town's reflection, this question becomes the central subject of all Barcellona.
It is already the same topic as if two members of this old box selected at the meeting in the outcome are given their hands.
And just this resort has chosen one of the rare agreements between the three Barcellone teachers and the predecessors of the university.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the election procedure has its resolve.
According to Roldana, after the question of the side of the rubber, "this must also be discussed about the "horse side", so the manifestation of Ildefonse Cerd on green eggs was not addressed to the end.
"We have to get out of the principle that the most clear barcellon park is the beach.
Despite other things, it's a big accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," he declared, for which the name "broad to Collserola" is "lexicological past": we can't imagine them "as incoming into the park, but more as a area where it is possible to be done."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayon with the experiences of the world of urbanism, is like "intelectual challenge" which indicates " some dangers".
The dangers resulting from "the uncertainty that today represents the project of the public place" after the experience of the 80th year, which had in Forum "they lab songs".
By fear it is a single limit of the border where it should be built.
"It's meaning to make another step," it's in principle to move a step further.
"The new urbanist and planning tools must be remembered, because the current (with reference to the General metropolitical plan (PGM)) can cause a fair grave."
If we focus more detailed on the question, the Modol believes that the powerful Collserola can be "considered as a park", but the Barcelone part of nowhere, and it is from the pure topographic.
The module also reminded that there is already a work that Patronat de Collserola has been carried out, which "not to end on the pack", even though the adviser's welcome to offer his place that it will be in the project from "a minute".
In addition, it understands that near the mountain and the city is a quality of a disability that allows them to be involved in the debate, but "in doubt," that it should be just this technical profile that will lead a multidisciplinary team ("it's all about consciousness", adds), which must be created: "Architects should be only tools."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question that has given the name of this game is consistent because there is no global view of Collserola, "16 election procedures, which will be killed by all the axes of the mountain - the sea, but there is no part study that would look at and understand it as a whole."
This causes at least he has notified himself to all 16 election procedures.
Otherwise, the project of one board can lead to the concept and definition of the neighborhood ship.
According to his opinion, the Council should assure that the aircraft which is unfairly over Ronda de Dalt should ensure the entire length of the area of equipment that would ensure a gasoul transition between the city and the green.
Casino passed Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of prison, the legal prosecutor Cadino Red granted grace to the brother of Monterrey's oldest in the process in which he was deceived for a fair exhibition.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal worked in 72 days and now will be released after what the legal prosecutor Casino Red gave him mercy before the Second Court of Justice in the circle, which negotiated the case of a sentence in which the brother of the oldest Monterrey was accused.
Following the attitude on Casino Royale owner Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published the series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás had to ask for a payment of the economic quota to enable illegal operation in the house of the Monterrey.
After public accusation, the State procurement started the penalty of the brother of panicity. On September 2, he was arrested and arrested for 30 days.
Following four hours from the Agency of the Public Ministry, number 3 for the property offences was transferred to the section 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the main city of the State.
In this place, the next 49 days after the second regulation was issued to the prison and the public ministerial agency had issued the opportunity to participate or organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadreyta for suspecting the owners of Casina Red by one and half million weight. However, only a few hours remained in the court with a centrally difficult supervision because he was threatened by death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the cities of San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On October 25, it was submitted to Jorge Yanez, who declared that after two months of investigation, the sufficient evidence that allowed Jonas to demonstrate the wine was provided. For example, the payment of 1,5 million weight of casine was made to the representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation would be enabled.
This Monday, the legal prosecutor Casina Red, Victor Aldo García Gomez, delivered the judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the elderly brother of the region. On the basis of this, it will be possible to return to freedom soon.
During the legal negotiation with the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, he asked Garcíi Gomez whether the damage was made and who of the partners decided to give mercy. But the lawyer also showed that the name would remain disappointed.
On the basis of the official writing 197/2011, Jonasis Larrazábal is granted legal grace. In the process that was led against it, there is no complaint to be given. It is also not possible to ask for damage or offence.
After a conversion with a legal agency about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanéz, was brought to the officer in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas of his official mercy and his case was sent to the archive.
He also announced that the judge had issued immediate regulation for its release.
The Secretary of Dionisio Pérez Jacome presented details about air accidents in which the secretary, Francisco Blake, was lost, and the other seven persons.
The Secretariat for Communication and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation of an accident in which the Secretary of the Government of Francesco Blake Mora and the other seven people show that the wheelman has fallen directly on the territory with full force, without having a chance to try for a needed arrival.
On the printing → Dionisio Pérez Jacome, a secretary for communication and transport, stated that before the start of the airplane, the pilot observed that climate submines allowed the years.
"The parts that are discovered are convinced that the unit has come into contact with the teren sometimes, the wheel has entered into the woods of 25 meters from the place where the unit was lost."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, therefore complied with all requests for personal transport.
Furthermore, he concluded that, based on the investigation carried out in the state, no parts were found in the country.
"When searched, it was found that parts of the flights were not located in another place, so the flight came to pén as a cellular.
"The wallet was appointed for 19 persons, complied with all the requests for transport of persons.
Terén shows everyone with seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment it is the most important to gain the most important results. However, investigation may take a few months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, the Director-General of Aviation and Aid Services, declared that at the moment of the arrival, the chairman of the President-General was moved to the aerodrome, and that it was unfortunately reached on a slightly accessible territory.
"This information supports the hypothesis that in the event of an accident, it has been a transitional operation," he said.
The representative of SCT Pérez Jacome called six basic points of investigation:
Visual years:
In accordance with the aircraft standards, the year has been carried out in accordance with the rules of the visual aeroplane, which means that the asset must be seen on the territory during the year.
Meteorological submins:
The AICM report refers to appropriate submissions at the start, in accordance with this aircraft, to the border, between DF and Mexico State, the low levels were dark in the lower heights.
Selected paths:
It is probably likely that the dark debt looked for lower and more visible to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the race.
The coordinators of the race and the last record of the radar heat records are agreed, it is likely that it has not occurred to the loss of control or to the deterioration of the aircraft.
Distortion of air residues on a limited territory:
The information we have available at the current time allows us to assume that it has occurred on the same tracker and on the side.
The design of the flight spray remains indicates that at the time of the pe·n’s speed was a celitic wallet.
No fire nor explosion.
There were no evidence mentioned in the place of unfortunateness that would testify of the explosion or the fire.
The recent analysis of the investigation shows that there could be some contacts with peʹna.
During the territory works, the rest of the flights were found in the height of up to 9200 degrees above the sea, the territory is combined, and the above is from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs show the boxes that probably reached the part of that road.
The information provides elements that, as it seems, indicate that the wheel could be contacted with the country in some places.
Following a delicate monitoring in the area of accident, there were no residues of the wheel, which strengthened the opinion that it had occurred in the condition when the wheel was still celitic.
Mexican health insurance institution started a gene research that causes obscurity
The Health Insurance Institute is conducting a research aimed at detecting gene responsible for children and adults.
The Mexican Health Insurance Institute (IMSS) noted that the research aimed at discovering gene that causes a residence in children and youths.
In the 21th century, Miguel ́z López report explained that a multidisciplinary team was established by doctors, sisters, survival professionals and social workers.
This team is based on the support of postgradual studies from the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Politechnical Institute (IPN).
The research can also be connected to a broad public, having or having no rights. People can come to sports centres of IMSS in Valle de Mexico, where each group of 8 hours will be conducted to youth tests.
He highlighted that the research began in the Sport Centre Cuauhtemomo (Mexico State) and from 8 October, this activity is also carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sport Centre (Sport Centre of Mexico).
When data will be obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sport Centre Independence (souterly from the Federal Age) and finally in the Sport Centre Morelos (Northern from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the objective of this research is to specify genetics and the importance of the development of obesity, and to focus on the risk factors of mexican children and young people, and thus to predict the result of chronic degenerative diseases.
In the event of the International Diabetes Day, celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the purpose is to store data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the agreement and supervision of parents, for specific questions about survival.
The questionnaire will also ask for physical activity and family anamnese of heritage diseases to avoid risk factors that may cause disease such as sugar or renal failure.
He noted that every Sabbath antropometric weight (weight, height, pass) is measured, the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and are tested by genes (to try to identify genes that are involved in child obesity).
López noted that this research reflects the concern of the health care of the alarming growth of child weight.
'The health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that only six years have occurred in boys to grow up by 77% and in girls with 47%. It has also been dramatic growth in the case of overweight,' reported the IMSS expert.
He noted that one of the arguments to look for indicators is thinking that the population of the country is different from the final populations of its genetic history.
He informed that the median Mexico has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% of European and 5% African, which is reflected in genes responsible for diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the general obesity genetic is currently explained as an incapacity to collapse the survival energy we consume (calorie) and which is stored in the form of tubes.
The researcher explained that the direct use of the students is that they will have a total assessment of the status of the child, which will prove whether they are known to be obscured or obstacles.
He concluded that even the presence of the dark color (acantosis) on the grid and the pre-decision indicates the probability that a given unit will suffer with metabolic problems and pre-sufficiency.
The information is confidential, doctors give it to parents in writing and explain to them all the feelings and changes of life that must be carried out to avoid illness.
López explained that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obscurity and other chronic diseases: a seat of life that means the lack of daily physical activity, a whole day seating before TV and the use of transport boxes instead of a short distance.
It also causes a big caloric income, which is the eighth consumption of coated drinks, carbonhydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of ducks and proteins and genetic force that is subject to this research.
In Asfalt with UNAM’s requests
Rafael Herrera, dec from the Chemical Faculty of UNAM creates modified asfalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with a better quality, independent of climate points and temperature
If it had been properly concerned about deficiency, it would not have been necessary to make almost 200 thousand profits after each period of rain in the Metropolitne Valle de México, Rafael Herrera Najer, a dec from the Chemical Faculty (FQ) from UNAM, which, rather, added that if the asfalt debt was appropriate, it would have reached a significant limitation of the benefits, or even it would be possible to remove them completely.
In its presence, the Technology cause of the benefits he made in the International Year of Chemicals noted that the laborator under its management develops modified asfalts with polymers, which should have a mixture of similar characteristics as as asfalt, but even more mechanical disorder, as well as at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asfalts could be used in places with extremely warm climate, such as in some cities north of the country. It would improve the ability and reduce the creation of winning.
He explained that asfalt, the most difficult part of the rope, is the collection of the molecules of carbonic, the molecule with a large molecular weight called asfalt, and other with low molecular weight that is called malten. Commonly adds asfalt typical viskoelastic character.
Viskoelastic character of asfalt consists of that, at high temperature, about 180 degrees, it is treated as a fluid, at 120 degrees has a high viskocyt and at 50 degrees it is at a strong condition, while the asfalt has the tendency to lay.
This means that the devotion of asfalt in the streets is not unique, but has changed during the day according to the temperatures and temperatures, the expert warned the chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Chemical Faculty noted that the range of streets in Ciudad de Mexico is covered by a flexible garage that creates six types of materials, from which three last are mixed with asfalt.
Among the highest levels is a asfalt injection, made by small stones of asfalt and then cut.
He highlighted that every stone that makes the injection is to get asfalt.
When a car passes, or when a pressure is created, it is so possible that the powers in the forest are well exposed.
If it was a modified asfalt, it would be better for them, the chemical engineer seems to be considered.
He added that on the asfalt index the last layer called the plastic, which is made by a hot stone, then also with a witch in asfalt.
Since this level will be attached to the contact with the vehicle, it must have more mechanical power than the asfalt entry and have to ensure the third vehicle.
As a part of the debt is made of a large complaint, it must have a sufficient pressure and must be taken into account the material from which it is prepared.
The climate, especially wheel and temperature changes, is also a very important factor that must be in memory. In particular, water has a big effect on asfalt inputs.
When the territory is low, the water spreads inside and is hard to get out, it causes all the levels of the forests and the outcome.
He explained that during the creation of benefits, the movie is to be destroyed as the first, and then the asfalt entries. But it does not come to damage at one moment, but it is a permissible process that should be stopped in the first signs using the appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National System of Factories, he also explained that the carrier is another important factor in the creation of profits, and therefore the steel of each individual level of depth must respond to the vehicle complaint and must be assured that this layer is not exceeding.
Rafael Herrera warned that on asfalt, we are still waiting for work and research at the beginning. For example, asfalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries, allowing us to easily perform the requirements without having to use high temperatures.
What was wrong with the Valle candidate to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the coronation of Miss Columbia.
That's how Valle gets the 14th title of the first multimise.
Valle del Cauca has not reached the corner of Miss Kolumbie again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the feeling of a victory, obtaining a silver corn and scarlet, based on the new Colombia's first majority.
Based on the outcome of the yesterday final in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico was winned and seizled, the department mentioned received the 14th title of the first multimise. Melina was so connected to the representatives of women from Valle del Cauca, which were obtained to winning crowns, but were finally announced by the first additions. Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (90), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Gi Elles Garelle Cacesias (2008) (2007).
A question that a lot of people do. What's wrong?
The result is the destruction of a great favorite, which in all previous rounds has shown that it is to become a new Miss Columbia, and not freely became the Queen Police and the Greatest face of Joile de Volgue. These titles, for example, reached Talian Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who had recently taken the title of Miss Columbia.
One of the key factors that decided that the report had decided to call her only Pr· Multimiss is that she didn't confess her answer to the question, "What book did you most like and why?", put Martin Murillo Gomez in the Leamos literary editor.
The candidate answered:
"I read much. I believe in the role, I think it's one of the culture forum. The book that most affected me in childhood was "Small Prince", a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of the world’s world’s life which everyone had to know. And today I have a book from Irene Nemirowski, Russian author. It is a wonderful book named "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, this answer was not pleased because of the term "culturalising" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual mentioned books found.
After the end of the celebration ceremonie, Melina declared that she was in silence and has joy from the outcome: "The world is wise what is going to happen.
And you people, you read, if you can.
One of the other hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogotic journalist noted that since the beginning, the candidate was the most famous, unfair and the one who took all the preliminary prices (Gastronomic call Oster, the title of publicity for the best artical clothing and the Queen Mother), raised the dependence of other resorts, stretched the Queen, which then burned on the scene.
It was evident at the first presentation of a boat on the beach of Hilton and during two reviews before the final crown.
Even when she was on both sides, it was to know that she missed power and burning, which led representatives from Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, the journalist of the "Aka home" program on the RCN Canal, thinks that Melinda has received the title of the first multimiss confirms that the candidate who has the most titles during the competition does not finally go with the corner of the Queen."
Moreover, in the last days, the Valle was more unfair to the media, and it didn't be paid to him.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the report on its interest in social work, which are based on the National Concurrence of Beauty.
Only two days before the election of Lucy Doughty's international member's report stated that they are looking for a woman who will have the social needs of their country.
"In the competition of Miss Colombia's niceness is lost about himself, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is important that candidates have been involved in such projects before they come into competition," she explained.
It also speculates that Valle's candidate lost points for the failure of her background and fibrosis, which was on the back of a pattern, but it was completely in contrast with the verdict of the portion, which chose her Miss "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, the right survival and the responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the Queen, admits that Melina had not the best body that there were the best girls here, "but the problems with fibrosis on the bathroom, which, according to my opinion, were not too significant, took them points to the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine believes that a parent from Valle has made a mistake when she has reached a few chirurgical steps.
"The chirurgical orders are all right, but they didn't tell them in Valle.
The body has never been her strong page, and here she has chosen her tax."
From this evaluation, which first made the National Conservation of Beauty, after the overseer in the floods came to the hard speech that was fulfilled. It stated that this was the satisfaction that Raymondo Melina wanted to not finally give them the highest coronation.
Whether it is true or not, it is certainly that Melina has started the year of her domination today, not as a Queen, but as a princess, from the position that gives her the opportunity to represent Cookie on various international concurrences, where it will be appointed by the National Concurrence.
However, it is written in →in as one of the kings who, despite the successful success in Cartagena, have not reached the highest coronation.
That was the job of the people of Cali who identified the dead Alfonse Cana.
An expert on the printing of the fingers from Cali entered the story as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonsa Cana.
The work of these officers is key.
On November 4, the CTI fingerprint expert entered in the history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana" and this by comparing the printing of fingers.
Of the seven officers on the printing of fingers that work on the CTI section, this week was the row of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada, who works 21 years in the court research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the officer in Chocó, where he often had to look for more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the dead were needed to identify.
In 2000, he moved to Valle’s main city, and after he solved the relevant cubes, he started to specialize the printing of fingers. This is the study of the third round, then the hands and the feet.
The week when operations were conducted against Alfonsi Cana, they told Eliazar to take clothes with her at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in the Palmir winter.
He knew that he had to identify two dead ones and that he was understood that one of them was a man who led the oldest guerilla in the world, so they asked her to take a card with the printing of the fingers of Guillerma León Sãoza (he's right name).
However, when he came with an investigative team to the place where the dead was found, he didn't have it from a physical distress; he seemed very different than in the reporting events.
He had no tissues, clothed as a village in the Danea, without bleeding, much more shielding.
But the prints don't.
Along with the galton light, inquiry and transplanter and light Eliazar began to compare dactil records with the card records.
It was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was confirmed that the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinson, confirmed whether it was actually the highest commander Farc.
Searching for tracks
For the Daktyloscope from Siyen de Cali, the recognition shown to Eliazar González President Juan Manuel Santos on the print operation of service against "Can" is very important.
People don't know our job.
Daktyloscope is exact, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in decisioning criminal acts.
In addition to the identification of the deadline, these people are helping them to investigate criminal acts such as clay or murder and confirm the identity of the offended persons.
When taking them, the delicts present false documents or have no papers.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator stated that in the case of hurt, he had to remove the wall wall in the house, because he was oppressed in this place to cut out the treasury full of shoes and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to collect prints, but in this case we could get the printing of the whole hand and identify the pachat that shared in some crowds," he reminded.
The printing of fingers may also confirm or reject suspects in case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with alcohol low around them.
On the basis of the investigation, one of the family members could be responsible for murdering and confirming that the printing of the carriage could be confirmed.
Although it cannot be gradually confirmed that he was a real murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the crime scene.
The CTI's fingerprint expert explained that the prints of the objects are "free by chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, the transplantator or the wheel is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the deliver database, or to the Registration.
"Problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are nowhere," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not all is as shown in the CSI TV.
Like all that's softing, it's not gold, not all you're touching remains.
However, if it can be used, the corresponding comparison must be carried out.
"Devastation" protests in New York
Hundreds of demonstrants were tired in the place of Zuccotti, where they wanted to set up.
A large part of them waited for the Space's order and moved to the nearby park.
The members of the Movies Obsidi Wall Street have been executed in the attack of the representative of New York when the court order tried to get back to Manhattan, from which they were carried out. Then they tried to take a different non-oral park.
Hundreds of manifestants were pressured in the place of Zuccotti, where they wanted to be given by the court command that allows "devored" to return to the place. The second part of the movement reacted to the layout by taking a park north of the city, where it came to another detention.
"When the court doesn't allow us to come back to the place, we'll sit in another place and continue to fight legally with the aim of returning to Zuccotti, and how the confusion, so peaceful manifestations," said one of the speakers' moves "Let's Watch Street", Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the answer "defrauded" to the exhibition of the camp that he himself commanded to the New York Officer, Michael Bloomberg, reached to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a command to prohibit the violent movement of the place and enabled demonstrants to continue to set here.
Besides, they took another park located on the crossing central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance in the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the Fary in Trinity Church.
At least for a hour, they were able to take the place, but then the police came and kept some manifestants.
The organization ensures that several hundreds of people have been sitting in the place, and that the delegation of religious representatives has also come to support them and has also been trying to negotiate with the police.
During the location of Zuccotti, which is a private property, it remains closed, and it is expected that the legal law of evacuation should be undergone.
Some of the moved manifestants even divorced and distributed a copy of the court order and even gave them to those who watched the place, which called "may shoes", said Bray, who judged that some police protestants were.
The Court order prohibits the offices to move "Ocupa Wall Street" motion members or to use "the laws that were published after the start of the debt, or to prohibit access to demonstrators to the park with trade or other places they used before."
The elder of Bloomberg said to print that, due to this court command, the city stopped opening the public room again and the manifestants warned that local laws did not allow them to return to the states and spackets.
The highest representative of the city has personally protected the vulnerable movement of Zuccotti, the operation in which it was arrested for 200 persons and to which it was attached because the manifestants "harmonized the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the location because it was "the place where people were not going to protest, but the laws and in some cases, because " some trades received a dangerous letter" and "the summers feared the quality of their lives".
"The morning procedure was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests for the workers of the American people," added a speaker's movement that committed concern that "they do not appreciate the freedom of expressing."
The representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" moved also stated that it was planning to organize "great actions" on Thursday in cooperation with Community and Committee organizations to remember two months after which the protests were marketed.

Along with Michael Bublé and other significant Canadians will appear in the TV program "It's and 日 Peters Christmas" on the 1st
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tima Allena in "Home Improvement", a boat in "Baywatch", a boy in "Playboy", a wife of Tommy Lee's annual musicist, and now a hero and a model will be Mrs. Maria in a special Sunday TV order.
The CTV private television station today announced that Anderson with the song of emotional songs Michael Bublé and other important Canadians will appear in the television program "It's and Peters Christmas" on the 1st, and will encourage Mr. Maria.
The CTV today has shown records from the television program, in which Anderson, also known from the Internet pornography photos, will appear to her former husband, the engine "Möttley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as Mrs. Maria holding in the bullets of Jesus's representative.
As Joseph appears on the scene Peters, a known Canadian comic of Indian Power, who recently acted as a modernist on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Crome Anderson and Peters, in the special CTV switching, will appear a Canadian song Bublé, who at the end of March march march was married in Buenos Aires with the argentin model Luisana Lopilato, which is close to the counterparty.

Japan returns to life after destruction of landscape
HDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household and ends the period of falls started in March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now it is declined from a devastated landscape that has grown into nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had to have to come from World War II.
The Tokyo Government has calculated material losses of $30,000, which, despite the difficult world-wide deficiency, are well decreased.
After three quarters of fall, the HDP value between July and September was found in the position that it was possible with the definitive validity of turning the page: the HDP increased by 1,5% in comparison with the previous quarter and 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for the Japanese tax year begins in March 2012 - also provide the largest growth time compared to the ice period to March 2010.
The survival may be partly explained by the purchasing of machines necessary to restore destroyed landscape and following tsunami.
Companys have increased their investment by 1,1%, the expenditure will lose 0.9% of the ice period to March. It is the first decrease after six months of uncontinued growth.
However, the real development of the Japanese economy is exhaustively from the impulse that needs to use the crisis for it, and from it they have strengthened, or re-infrastructure, which is to use the failure to do so, and they begin completely from zero.
Japan was wake up, in particular thanks to the development of the households, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese BDP.
This variable increased by 1%, increasing the costs of vehicles, roads and free-time activity.
Yellow Stigma
The rounds were in the hand of the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "reserved values" for investments that flee from the long crisis from the euro and the inquiry of the United States. It is a privilege that is, however, a great challenge for export undertakings.
With a stronger currency, products in the cargo are more lower, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony recommended their weak results in July to September just the yen course.
While markets continue to cover EU border countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda is aware.
"We must take attention to the risk that remains, such as the destruction of certain economics, the impact of the inflammation in Thailand and the increased yenu," said the State Secretary for the Economic Policy of Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And the perspictives are no encouragement.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that the percentage of Member States had shown the characteristics of economic disabilities in September.
The indicator, which predicts integrity in the world economy, showed that the economy of the main powers is quiet.
She reduced four decades to 100.4 points above 100.8 in August.
The euro has even been obtained under the average of 100 levels. It has reached to 99.13 points.
Atenas width the incidence again
Papadimos says that they will be approved by oppressive measures, but the conservators will not subscribe any written commitment
Greece, with strict and risk-border guarantees and the uncertainty that she has re-controled, is still more attached to the labyrinth that leads to the outcome of a large debt crisis in Europe.
The opinion that the "convention" of the new Greek transitional Government is given more than the requests of Brussels than the real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days that he received in his name would probably be short for them, the president would conserve the New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, stated that the new suspicious measures would not support and repeat its request to subscribe new elections to the proposed date of 19 February.
"The task of this Government is to apply the summit decision of 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will take place tomorrow by voting on the government's confidence.
Package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officers and new measures against tax institutions will be between the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samarase does not explain the doubt about his position: "We have committed us to help the transitional government, but we have no more committed."
The Chairman of Conservatives took a little away in his presentation to the EU and MMF address, and these organizations have to dislock 8 billion, which are attained by Athens, and he also declared that they would not support and underscribe any commitment to the implementation of difficult measures.
The European Commission, which has already been identified by the effect that caused Papandre to play with a referendum, noticed that her requests were unprecedentable: it does not block any aid if the new government and representatives of the main parties did not describe "the written commitment without doubleness and what may be first".
The speaker for the Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Trinity inspectors will return "very quickly" to Athen and will act with the new government about "what's to pay the sixth part" 8 billion. Definition of date but does not exist.
The Greek friend's still having a choice of what to swim from.
Queen Sofie: "There are tools for progress and advancement"
The Queen highlights the primary position of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the world level in relation to microfinancing".
Queen Sofie remembered yesterday that in the last two decades, the country became a second gift of the planet in relation to this tool of cooperation, which is based on "the tool of social progress, justice and the better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in humans".
The Queen yesterday started the 5th worldly summit of micro-country in Valladolid with the conviction that "no doubt" is that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" for it, and they reached the Millennium Targets set up by the United Nations for 2015. "In particular, it is about the fulfilment of the objectives that have to achieve the reduction of the half number of people living with less than one dollar per day, so with the amount fixed by poverty."
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all the corners of the planet and take this task responsiblely", stressed Queen Sofie, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions of Summitu, which takes up to Thursday, "assuring the creation of better capabilities and opportunities for the most poor and especially for women", which are designed mainly.
"We've got a lot" and "Multiful challenges are still before us."
Summit of micropayments must be not only a discussion forum but also a platform that supports "base objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal was that 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services until the end of 2015 and that 100 million families would be over the poverty in which they are currently living.
The concept of micropowers has been extended to Spain and to other countries of the world after "what was issued on this road by the Mediterranean of Muhammad Yunus," the Queen introduced and added that it was "the act of justice and the needed recognition".
The father of this tool described as a "wonderful idealist who had been on the way of fighting poverty." She met his work for 15 years ago when she was released to Bangladesh to meet directly with his money policy.
After this experience, the world summit in Washington and other meetings, for example, in the Power of Slovenia in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I could find a continuous development, the Queen explained its support to the project last night the title of "the head of the family", which she had made in Valladolid "poor loss".
The Queen Sofie made her exhibition by calling the staff to participate in the debate and search for solutions and thus enabled them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical emperation"
The Ministry of Zambia, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that the solidarity is "ethical imperative" to which all democratic states must be managed.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to join cooperation with developing countries only with the balloobject, because this cooperation is "permanent obligation".
Jimenez believes that micropowers represent a "serious and honest policy to remove poverty" and now more than ever before the Government of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to become a victim of grapes.
For Spain, a micropower is one of the main development cooperation lines.
The State Secret for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on our confidence to people who are all locking the door.
The CDU calls for the election of the European President on the basis of the general electoral right
Without serious initiatives for the Office and the Christian Democratic Party of Angela Merkel, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) passed on Monday 14 November.
The question of Europe's future was not fully, but it has become up to the top, especially to be satisfied by members of the parties who consider government policy today against Greece and may be tomorrow to the Italian for lax.
On behalf of the President of the European Commission, the leadership was to be adopted almost uniformly.
Only nine of the 1001 delegations were against, and 10 delegations remained voted.
A few minutes of sheep comes to the conclusion of the exhibition of Angely Merkel and follows a few hours after Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European Ministry of Finance, did not leave a place for doubts.
The Officer's thinking and our ability can be put into the slogan: the response to the crisis "not less than Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "new million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Office in Europe, "the time was changed."
This could be done by changes in Lisbon, which allow the European Union to enhance the control of the budgetary policies of the euro Member States, but it could also take place in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the general electoral right "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the thoughts of the convention accepted, whose inspirer is Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly only less likely that all twenty-seven countries will agree on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom and the leaders of the CDU believe that we will also take the same position as Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is out.
Similarly, delegates refused to evaluate the weight of each country in representation of the European Central Bank, depending on its economic weight, which evidently contributes to the strengthening of German weight.
The Officer has taken a few references to the Conrad Adenauer and Helmuta Kohla, but it has not been attempted to get a congress of the "small" European States or of the states that are in age to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although we are concerned with Europe, one subparagraph of the importance of "France and German friendship", Angela Merkel France did not quote.
Just not right.
When she recalled that just two years ago, the bloody battle has passed in Lipse.
At the time, it was one of the most humiliating destructions of Napoleon Armies.
What is the subject of the work of incapacity?
Following support, UMP and the Government of Official Incapacity are launched.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on July 15th in Bordeaux and will visit the Office for Social Support, where the statements on the subject repeated from 2007 on the fight against social undertakings and the re-distribution of solidarity.
As a result of this official, which comes from the willingness of support in the context of increased accuracy, but is nothing less important in the view of the right presidential campaign, the rightness is to focus on work and incapacity.
Firstly, for the budgetary efforts, the Government intends to introduce employees in the private sector the fourth day of unability before they continue to support the disease.
Clearly, without a consent of the company, the employee who is sick would lose four days of swimming, so at least 15% of his monthly receipt.
Awareness that risks to cause a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the list of Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
In addition, measures to be made by the following symbolic advancement measures: giving the national employees an unlimited work on one day (not yet incapacity is not able to exhaust three days in the private sector).
While these questions are the subject of the debate, the right holding will also start the subways that this time are related to crimes related to work incapacity.
"The controls will be much more stretched and further: if you are attained, you will return," advised Xavier Bertrand when talking about the RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
Similarly, as in other cases, the effects of the notice seem to be sometimes unproportioned in view of the truth of unrighteousness in work failure.
These were the subject of continuous follow-up since 2002 and the political support that brought their fruits.
The French are not more sick than anywhere in Europe.
Let's first stop with some official numbers.
According to Caisse national d'assurance, more than 237 million euros of daily refunds were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Health Documentation, in 2008, the replacement of EUR 11,3 billion were represented by EUR 5% of health expenditure.
From this amount, 46% were related to maternal contributions and employment contributions and 54% were related to work incapacities, e.g. 6,2 billion euros.
So only 2,5% of health costs.
According to the Alma Consulting Group studies, Franceses had an average of 14,5 days of work in 2010 and were incapacity for 17,8 days in 2009.
The average that covers certain derogations in itself: another survey published in 2007 on the sites of killings with the opportunities of Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 questioned French employees replied that they had not chosen any day of work and incapacity.
Another studies, currently conducted by disease insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37.8% of work incapacities were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% remained longer.
When we compare them to their European neighbors, the French employees are not more than other than the worklessness.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total absency (of health care or none) was in France between 10 and 11,8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 18% in the Netherlands.
The sublime in work unability is only a very small part of work on black.
It's about subwaters, these are just a small range.
Increasing legislation since 2002 caused systematic controls to work and incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM concluded that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285.000 were carried out for short-quality "inadmissible or too long", including 37.050 cases.
In the case of systematic control incapacities of less than 45 days, 11% of cases were calculated for 1,2 million controls, namely 132 000.
Thus, in total, 169 000 "inadmissible" cases for a number of million employees who had an incapacity.
The number that represents much less than the number expressing work on black.
According to UMP Dominique Tiana, the author of the red report on this question, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the choice of tax per year, which is more than the total amount of daily refunds and, therefore, unnecessaryly more than the underwaters associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new salvation plan
Greece will need a new salvation programme to restore its economy.
On Monday 14, the President Lucas Papademos made these words before the Ministerial Parliament and added that hundred days given to his government would be sufficient to fulfil this task.
"To this end, and again set our economy on our feet, we support our European partners and a new budgetary plan," the Governing Boss announced when he found his first public manifestation in the middle of the debate on the vote of trust in Parliament.
The application of the decisions adopted on 27 October in the summary of the euro will be added to the new government's task, because our country is in the game in the euro.
Consequently, Mr. Papademos suggested that the public deficit of the country will be from now to the end of the year "approximately 9%" of the gross domestic product after 10,6% in 2010 and 15,7% in 2009.
The rights reject new sustainable measures
The leader of the rights of Antonis Samaras expressed its support on Monday with the already approved measures to try to avoid the debt crisis, but he warned that his party was not committed to any additional sustainable measures.
"For any new measures we will not take on our hand," Samaras insisted on meetings with the lawyers on the New Democracy side.
We agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and fighting against destruction, but we are against any policy that would protect economic survival.
Mr. Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that MMF and the EU do not debloque the necessary amount of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties supporting the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that they did not sign anything under the external pressure.
The Commission of Experts has to legalize Eutanasia and assisted suicide.
According to the news of the King’s Canadian Society, the Canadians have been deprived of death.
In the case of the Commission's paliative care, it is important that governments, health care institutions and doctors work income in order to ensure the best paliative care and in cases of cancer.
The Canadian company lives with the idea of destruction.
Only 9% of the Canadians accept the opportunity to talk to your doctor about the subjects in which they want to die and takes decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society, which shared six experts working in different areas, including ethics, rights and medicals.
This Commission recommends the Government to amend criminal rights so that it allows aided suicide and eutanase if this option appears necessary for the patient considered competent to take such decisions.
At the beginning, experts quote recently an independent agency Economyst Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Maybe Canada was located in 10 places, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has brought up a culture in which people fear to speak of death."
Medicalisation yes or not, 77% of the Canadians do not have access to the carrying care, experts communicate us with the Mandate of the King's Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die in the house of the Canadians, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to the entire Canada, while in Quebec province this number is the maximum of 86% of the dead in the hospital.
As regards the delicate issue of eutanase and assisted suicide, the authors of the reports affect the conclusions that are against the position of the federal government, which has already said that there is nothing to change on the criminal law of eutanase and assistance of suicide.
According to experts who also undertaken controls of all countries where these accesses are legalized or are not considered criminally, there is no evidence that this discovery causes an injury in the practice of eutanase or an assisted suicide to persons inadequate or incompatible.
Instead, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, together with the reports, confirmed more than four cases in the telescope just in countries where eutanasis and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasis is also conducted in Canada, where it is uniquely illegal."
"Assisted suicide is carried out in Canada, where it is uniquely illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are declined from Eutanasia
Remember that, according to the investigation of the forum of Reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already been expressed in the benefits of eutanase, because they are allowing people to facilitate their suffering at the end of life.
And 66% will mean that the legalization of eutanase means that we send a message about the life of older or hendicaded persons has a less price.
41% of the questioned persons think that they should not be judged.
In the matter of maintaining or interrupting the care of the patient is less, the authors say reports.
In the list of their recommendations, it is also indicated in the criminal law that the derogation from the treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not penalty.
The Commission also requires experts to be trained by professional doctors to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of crime.
In the case of the Commission's paliative care, it is important that governments, health care institutions and doctors work income in order to ensure the best paliative care and in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of a paliative or final disturbance already used in Canadian health equipment, the Commission requires that it be considered at the time when it does not serve for the reduction of physical pain, eutanase, and to support the same procedures.
Refunds of residual experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their deficiencies regarding the conclusions of the reports of the King's Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a medical specialist, implied the position of experts-signers of reports as "extreme" otherwise because he does not restrict the practice of eutanase to sick in the final phase.
"This opens the door of a cup when everyone who was invoked by life and who had been more than 18 years could ask him to help him burn self-mortality," says Pierre Deschamps, who justified the summary of messages yesterday.
P. Deschamps also highlights that it seems that the authors of the reports have made the autonomy of the person over all the final values that create a social leading company.
'Cause in the company, it says, there are aware marks and restrictions.'
Margaret Somerville's medical rights specialist also introduced "fortunate records to the conclusions of the report which she was used as "manifest for eutanase".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly doubted about the data of the report on the absence of doubts in some countries where eutanase and aids are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and in the United States of Oregon.
The Jordan King invites President Assad to reject
The lady's talking about "complot"
Syria is more isolated
Bašára al-Assada stoups showed yesterday before the Ministry of Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures were intensified on Syria, president of Bašára al-Assada, who distorted them with Russia's support and talked about "complot" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria in Lisa of Arab States, the European Union enhanced its sanction against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the Neighbouring countries with Syria, renewed a position in the benefits of the President of Assad.
The Jordan King Abdallah II was the first ruler of the Arab State yesterday, who called the president of Bashara al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about 40 civilians and military forces were killed, "a power."
"If Bazhar had the heart of his country's interests, he had to give a demission, but he had to also create submines necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, the country of neighborhood with Syria, in interview for the BBC station.
To its part, the Turkish diplomatic leader Ahmet Davutoglu was aware that the efforts of Turkish dealing with Syrian regime from the beginning of the year have not been corrupted with success.
"They who don't live on the Middle East in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will go" he declared with an injury to the neighbors of Syria, which Turkey applies to what a stronger line is.
The United States enjoyed the "forestation of the consensus against Assad and the inevitable negotiation of Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab States Ligy and the European Union.
"The International Community, the United States, the European Union, the Liga of Arab States, the country as Turkey applies to what a stronger tone is to the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, speaker of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
As the Syrian observer for human rights announced, during that time, Dera was destroyed in the city of 16 civilians in South Syria and 19 members of the prosecutor forces.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians have been destroyed by the shots and the concentrated shooting of hard bullets in the town of Jobar in Hooms.
However, in the pressure of the Syrian Ministry of the Affairs, Walid Mouall considered that the country had been released on the way out of the crisis.
Recently, he also reacted to the decisions of the Arab States to stay in Damascus, which represents a dangerous step.
Syria's not going to be removed,'added with the assurance that "the complots associated with Syria are not successful."
After his decision, the Membership will consider Syria's "mechanism of protection of civilians" at the time of the Arab States' Liga and will be planned to send 500 protectors of human rights, journalists and military observators to the country.
The French Ministry of Alain Juppé is also favorably acknowledged to send the United Nations observators with a view to protect civilians from the repression of a regime, which is "paranoidly".
The new special Meeting of Ligy is invited to the morning to Rabba to find a plan for a crisis solution, which was decided on the 2.
The Russian Minister Sergej Lavrov considered that the decision of the Arab States Ligy was "in error" yesterday, while China invited Syria to adopt a crisis-resolving plan, but it was completely providing support against Damaskus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifices in Italy
The next leader of the Italian Government Mario Monti requested the markets for a little time to be able to form its team and to start applying a program that will include "offers" with the aim of getting the trust lost in the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed the political parties yesterday before the representatives of officers and employers are meeting today.
It should be set up a relatively shield cabinet composed of technocrates that do not belong to the parliamentary parties.
"Monti has spoken of a important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a lawyer of one of the fair parliamentary groups of discussions, after meeting the designated Ministerial President.
The President of the Missionary Summit Gianfranco Fini expects that Mario Monti will request the Parliament to declare confidence to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
Finally, Mario Monti will end with the representation of a small team of twelve ministers to the President of Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on nervousness on financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
"Democracy pays exact terms" concerning the preparation of the government and its programme, he highlighted and added that it is certain that markets will be patient and understanding."
His name by the Chairman was accepted from the beginning, but anxiety again occurred after the unexpected unexpected injury of the industrial production in the euro.
The named Minister should be a team that includes mainly technology, even if he noticed that he would also adopt "policy".
He concluded that the new government would take up until 2013, namely to the date of the next elections.
According to the President of the Missionary Summit Gianfranca Fini, the new government will receive the trust of Parliament to fifth.
Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary interest and to become Italy again a strong article of Europe.
The speaking Commissioner of the European Commissary of Rehna stressed that our diagnosis of the Italian economy has not changed with the new government.
The European Union is convinced that, despite the sustainable plans adopted in the past months, Rome will not reach its objective, which is equivalent to the budget in 2013, and requires a new firm measures.
Confindustria Emma Marcegagli's business association head, who is meeting with Montim in the deterioration, focused on the need to resume the economy "for the country that does not show growth cannot maintain deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognised for its professional knowledge and independence, "profesor" symbolized by the authors of the leaders "the challenge to seriousness" and "other Italy", represents the "epochical change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The time of his team's life will be very unknown.
The President Napolitano would have generated preliminary elections, since Italy has to place a state debt for 200 billion euros until April 2012.
Soviet Dec helped the Iranian nuclear programme
The Soviet Deputy Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator used for atomic weapons, reported in an American non-governmental organization specialized for atomic risk.
The International Agency for Atomic Energy (MAAE) and other documents excluded from this UN Agency shall be reported at the identifier of the Institute of Provision and International Security (ISIS).
Last week, MAAE reported her "severe concern" about the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute, the width of the MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (No. 1934) should work three decades ago in the Soviet military research center in Czechland (Ural), where the production of synthetic diamants should be used by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave the center to establish an "nano-diamanty" company in Kiev.
The economic forces of his company were to bring him to contact the Iranian Majesty in 1995 in Ukraine.
Before returning to Russia, he had to cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, MAAE has made clear information about the development of the detailed system carried out by Iran "from the work of an alien specialist who did not only know this method, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked during a substantial part of his work and career in this field in the military nuclear programme of the country from which it comes."
Anti-muslim crimes and delicts were 50%
According to the FBI published on Monday, the number of crimes and delicts against the Muslims has increased up to 50% from 2009 to 2010, while the remaining racial and religious violences have declined quickly or have been low.
According to these numbers, the total volume of violence burned against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which was 49% of increase in 13% in violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4% in crimes against Jews and a total growth of 14% in anti-governmental crimes and delicts.
The total group of "owned criminal acts" was very easier to 6,628 cases, from which 47,3 per cent were based on racial differences and 20 per cent of religious differences.
"In 2009, it is disappointing to see these criminal acts and delicts again," the Human Rights First Organization, who is involved in human rights, said the growth of anti-muslim violence is particularly significant," added an organization in its communication.
"Human Rights First acknowledged that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, must be considered to be seriously defrauded by human rights," adds one of the leading factors of the organization of Paul Legendre.
"American Government can and must do more to cope with these crimes," he adds and believes that this could be the improvement of the police reports of the hatred crimes."
"Ownerial criminal action" in the American federal law is the inheritance of the time of fighting for civil rights.
This legal rule was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to maintain violence associated with the race, the color of the wheat, the religion, the pêch and now and the sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and likes more Facebook
The site that provides a microblocks service Twitter has made changes in the design on Monday to enable its owners to observe the activities of followers, which sometimes compares its Facebook services.
New "activity" and "name" offers makes it better and directly know the activities of other persons who follow you or whose responses ("tweets") you follow.
This allows whether they can monitor the contributions, whether they are notified to new, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August at a small percentage of actors" before it was extended in the whole network on Monday, the AFP speaker said to Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known by his little instinct function, with some incomprehensible terms (RT for repeated extensions of any other, followfriday for recommender de suivre un other user) making le bonheur des inities, opening so a public plus large with a maniement plus comparable a the of the networks of great public Facebook and Google+.
On the network, people immediately consider the importance of this innovation in their "tweets".
"It's unusual, it takes many places and it's too like Facebook," writes @imb123.
"Function The fact will help me to follow some of my Twitter elements," sent @dannykronstrom.

inscription of the Golden Rules on the balanced budget in the establishment
The Government has decided in order to decrease the public deficit and avoid such a decrease of the rating agencies of the Russian rating.
It was the same social-democracy officer Werner Faymann who reported this decision to the conclusion of the Council of Ministers when the Russian public debt is 74.6% higher than the criteria set out by Maastricht Agreement, but much less than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of the Russian solvency was reduced only to one degree from AAA+, they had to pay at a rate every year for three billion euros more," argumented the major officer and minister of the Christian democracy Michael Spindelegger.
In this case, the Commission requests the summary of the euro country in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the heads of States and governments requested to reduce public deficiency and the achievement of the equality of public assets to the establishment or to the law of the same value until the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the cancer government is close to "the German model", Germany was the first European country that adopted such "regulation".
By 2017, the public structural deficit must be reduced by 0.75% of the brutal domestic product (HDP) each year and begins by 2017 the public structural deficit of the Federal State's deficit shall be reduced each year by 0.35% of the HDP, while the landscape and the foreign countries will have to show a balanced budget.
The objective is to obtain the public duty under the criteria of 60% set by Maastricht with − in the Horizon 2020/21.

Node threatening new intervention on the division markets
The Japanese Minister President Yoshihiko Noda warned that the Japanese institutions would have to recover on the devises markets if they should only continue in strengthening.
"Let's see how we've done this in the past, if we're trying to get too much inconsistency" in the changed yan course, he explained the Y. Noda senate.
Once again, the historical values of the Japanese offices were brought to intervention on October 31.
On that day, Tokio sold a currency for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has recently convinced the record against the dollar valid since 1945.
But only since that time, the purchases of investors have been regularly supported, which consider it as a "safe stage" in the uncertain periods of world economic decline and European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar was recovered under 77 January and the euro falled under the symbolic layer of 105 January to the nearby level of the last intervention.
Before financial crisis in 2008-2009, a dollar had a value of approximately 120 January and more than 160 January.
This planning of Japan's currency is damage to the export island because it delivers the price of the products of Made in Japan and reduces the value of the costs received by the Japanese companies from the foreign when it transfers them into the domestic currency.
"Japan's refusal" from the consequences caused by March landscape and wheel tsunami, which deployed the region of Tohoku at the north-east of the country, Y. Noda, who fears that this trade has not yet been killed in the cave of cruel survival.
The third world's economic power renewed growth in third quarter years (1.5% in view of the previous quarter), which is first in one year thanks to the growth of exports and to avoid domestic disasters.
But the Minister's president claimed that the high value of the yuan nerelected the "National Economy of Japan".
The Japanese Minister for Financing Jun Azumi invited the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which started at the two-day meeting of its political and monetary Council to adopt all possible measures leading to weakness.
But the major Governor of this Institute Hirohide Yamaguči warned that BoJ had already adopted "appeal measures" before, indicating that no additional monetary weakness could be expected in the middle.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the cost paper establishment increased by 5.000 billion of January (47 billion euros) its purchases of national post-lines and increased to 55.000 billion of January (519 billion euros) a range of amounts that are based on the purchases of different price papers with the aim of covering liquidities.
Euro:
the sazs stood, the worsts fail.
The risk of debt crisis is still supporting European indicators.
With the name of new Government leaders in Greece and Italy and the best numbers of growth in France and Germany, the taxes of weak countries continue to grow.
European villages are still concerned about the Euro stability today, on 15 November, to negative expectations.
In Paris in 10 hours CAC index 40 losses 1.4% at 3.064 points.
Index Dax in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"As new incentives, the outcome of the euro's moneys that are in the past, the markets with shares worldwide are still a part of the recent profits."
"The Norwegian investors only realize the risk of orders," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets, quoted by the Re日s agency.
Burza in Tokyo was concluded with a decrease of 0.7%, which suffered because of the risks of the market for Europe's ability to cope with a long crisis.
"Japanese as the rest of the world has eyes on Europe and the change will continue only in a difficult variation core until investors have evidence that the stability is stabilised," Mitsuige Akino, the fund manager of Iquiyoshi Investment Management.
This restart in the future of the euro is a damage to the single currency that continues in the attack in its decline.
The euro is at the lowest level since a month and a half.
In 10 hours, the European currency is 1.3570 dollars at the approach of 0.4%.
According to customers, the CDU officer Angely Merkel adopted on its conference on Monday and the predicting opportunity to get out of the euro for countries that would be experienced in the trends and that they would not have to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far from 6%
The tax rates for money in Italy and Spain remain in a very concernful height.
Today, the estimate of the Italian decade obligations is 6,85% and the expenditure of the Spanish decade obligations is 6,2%.
These efforts affect the rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of the market.
The chair of the future Italian Government Mario Monti requested greatly time on the markets to be able to carry out a threatened in Italy with a harmful caused by its debt.
The new Greek President Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of decisions adopted on 27 October at the summit of the euro will be "the task" of his government.
Spain is once again located in the draft markets in the country when they make elections in the missionary snippet on Sunday.
The term ("pread") between the decades of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
In expectation of numbers of euro growth
The statistical numbers say that France mentioned in the third quarter of the economic growth of 0.4% caused by mainly household, which is a little better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Insee and Economic Studie revised the direction of the numbers below for the second quarter of the decrease of 0.1% of the BDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that the economy's most concerned.
During the same period, Germany registered the growth of 0.5%.
The European Commission has just warned the risk of a new recess.
Energy policy:
the facts must win over dogmates
If there are any subjects that cannot be understood on the basis of short development or under emotions, it is a energy policy.
Availability and the price of electricity has direct impact on the purchase and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural that the meeting at elections is the opportunity to think about such contributions and the location of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be successful when all economic, social and environmental reactions are examined.
The French must put their position on objective and rational data.
Moreover, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but the demography development calls from now to 2050 a double demand for electricity, if we want a significant part of the world population to save the important part of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to take into account the lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, and it can not be forgotten to reduce the need to reduce the need for gases caused by a glass effect to fight against climate changes, which is the subject that is in the present environmental debate.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains only in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
However, it is not a case that undermines its decision of need but another source of replacement by himself, nor Switzerland, which considers the right establishment of only the electrical last generation.
Instead, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, and at least some countries have been cited, continue to decide in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand their park on one unit renewal of one electricity interrupted after Three Mile Island.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality resists it.
The Berlin election is shown by the delivery of the electricity price, increased in energy dependence on gas imported particularly from Russia, with an increase in CO2-elected electricity for land gas and carbon.
All of these inappropriate tricks we've been feeling for a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves, and they thought about it.
The European shampion in the electrical electricity, from which 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest carbon consumers and gases from the depth of irregularity, for which the CO2 and the Danish prices are higher than 65%, and 50% of the European prospectus.
On the contrary, our energy policy will pay our neighbor for electricity 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in globalised energy economy the costs represent the key factor of competitiveness and security of the national area, the French enterprises consume the benefits of the most late electricity in Europe.
In this context, any significant reduction in nuclear energy share would lead to a strong increase in electricity price, which would result in the illustrative beautiful declaration of the renewable industrialisation of our country and purchase forces.
The price that the large quantity of French refuses to pay, as is essentially against this energy, as shown by the research of public reduction.
Remember that our country's energy policy has enabled to establish sectors with 125,000 direct workplaces and with 41,000 employees.
The exporting sectors are strongly involved in the international markets in large quantities of small and medium-specialized enterprises creating jobs which cannot be transferred into a carrier.
If France decided to leave the nuclear, she would offer a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would come to 6 billion euros per year, which the country would gain for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrical owner would deal with a nuclear reactor proposed to work 60 years while the impact of his manufacturer would be planned?
In the solution to energy balance, there is no power source for energy production that does not exist nor a devil.
The volume of low CO2 production equipment and nuclear equipment uses renewable energy resources carried out by the French industrial AREVA group to witness the complimentarity of energy resources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Agency for Nuclear Safety, which conducts an uncompromised and transparent supervision of existing nuclear electricity as well as the building of a new electricity in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionality is recognised have a sense of security in blood.
In fifty years, he knew the nuclear development of three serious havary.
The only in Three Mile Island was inside normal operations and remained without human victims and results for life.
The drama has caused the concept of the reaction and the inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some believe that the havary was a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented district, which caused decades of thousands of people to die.
The nuclear progress will take the teachings from this havary as it did in the previous two.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and the German nuclear security authorities, operators and actors is that the EPR reacter represents the concept of the ability to deal with such animals.
While all interesters who want to build a nuclear electricity, they consider it, the stop of its exhibition in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to AREVA and EDF group competitors and the release of the way to strengthen the leading positions in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best solution of energy for our country, but it would be necessary to allow emotions, dogmates and machines to control the debate so decided for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is it for the economy of immigration of trials or chances?
The immigration in Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles - the payment of police, courts and administrative policies, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights" which France glorify.
Recently, it was the administration of the complaint that was the subject of the students of the students who became currently when the Minister of the Inner (see the letter of Libération of 23 May) declared that France had no other talents, walls and servants.
But it was just sometimes elected under the economy.
It is necessary to say that there is a pretty large agreement between left and right.
In 1976, Jacques Chirac gave his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrant works are located" and at the left of Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France could accept all the world's distress."
The only difference is the degree of magnitude
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the Poland installers in the French territory was divided and left.
In both camps, immigrants are assumed as a force for economic and French company.
The only section consists in the degree of magnitude that we are going to make for immigrants.
In his programme, François Holland is limited to banality when it believes that the common development will enable us to resolve our "immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a challenge and a problem may be paid in elections, but the economic is very lovely.
As economics Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in their recently published part of the most recent synthesis of immigration knowledge (Exceptal People: How Migration Shape Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton Family Press, 352 pages): there is a wide consensus between specialists on the position of impact movements on economic growth, etc. and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Limitation of immigration protects growth and damage of employment.
The fears of the effects caused are based on the idea that these people can replace the French work, especially those less sensitive, and create a pressure to reduce their weeds.
However, experience shows that immigrants are much more complementary than refunders for French employees by performing work in sectors with lack of employees.
Small immigrants in sectors that do not participate in French employees, and most of them in dynamic sectors in which the education offers places.
Put the effect on mzda
Like chirurg will have a job in the country where the lack of anestesiologists, this complement between France and the employees causes immigrant income to have a positive impact on French employees and employees.
Giovanni Peri so calculated that growth movements of 1% would lead to an increase in real mixture between 0.6% and 0.9%.
Instead, it does not take into account that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of thoughts and economic growth (a large part of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were imposed by immigrants).
Migrants are also pure social system contributions in European countries in the average 1% of the total budget.
The World Work Organization, for example, considers that in Germany, one immigrant will bring his life to public budgets a pure contribution (income minus expenditure) 150000 euros for a period of 30 years.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed at the beginning of his mandate the desire to get for the missing percentage of growth's estimated teeth."
The following teeth used for the destruction of immigrants had just a negative effect.
Europe has discovered the democracy that remains in the view of the European Democracy
Democracy is rare and very cruel goods.
The European continent should remember that, although he had invented it in Athena two thousand years ago, he lived in the tragedy of world wars, totality regimes, holocaust, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that to make democracy definitively triumph over their enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and carry it out the best way.
However, it is already known from Napoleon that it was about the easily thinking.
The general electoral right, even if it is necessary for subminal democracy, is not sufficient and can be a "appointment tool" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, division and control organisation, education, dedication, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we live is a economic crisis, but it is just that since the beginning of the political and democratic crisis.
The recognition of the error of the Greek reference type of yes will not have the value of double discovery in this direction: discovering the need for a great return of political power, but also the discovery of anxious feeling of his incapacity, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought to be convinced.
The truth is that the front lines of democracy have been moved today and that many of the Republican wars have no longer been shot in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we'll require a number of national references organized in accordance with needs and deorganisations.
Bianco made to the European absolutist monarch or a spring with the legs of the feet to an empty nationalist depth: what choice for citizens!
No, we don't want the node of gilotine, but a common, full-right, peaceful, and continuous choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crisiss in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor were they finally not knowing where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the same thing that all Europe stands before the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers its incapacity and their lack of solidarity.
It is the same whole Europe, which is decreased at the international scene.
We are disappointed by transfering the overseer to Europe - but this is the whole Europe who will quickly lose its sovereignty and everyone of its nations with it.
It is important to return the management of the European Democracy Project.
Because only the Europeans will be able together to reduce their debts, to avoid market governments and to prepare the future.
The crisis will propose decisions at European level that will be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to the graves.
After we were fighting against this socialists and Jacquese Delors, all today are deeply demanding a European economic government.
Come on.
But thinking of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as citizens, would be a new foolishness and a new blind street.
We must take a new stage of European building on ourselves.
To survive the Republic in France, it was necessary to be "republised".
Revolution in interests couldn't suffice.
This lesson continues to be paid.
We need to build Europe, which will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more political and real European democratic superiority.
Let us become Europeans, and they built Europe.
"Uncontakt" chips cards are broadcast
In the optimistic atmosphere, it will be opened in the vilepinte attack near Paris the world headquarters of chips.
In 2011, Eurosmart’s cabinet should complete the increase in the world sales card with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most weightless is the uncontakt segment that allows payment in a hot transport or purchase purchases only by enhancing the card to the reader.
This year should be sold throughout the world 460 million chips cards against 320 million sold for a year ago!
Their share should remain in 2012 (evented 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total market of chip cards (6.925 million cards).
After it was in the APEC country, Europe gets a territory in an uncontakt payment.
Approximately 26 million bank cards of Visa are already equipped with this and 75.000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginning of humility is more than 400,000 uncontakt cards of Visa.
But big business rows work in two.
This year Carrefour delivered 2,5 million uncontakt cards Pass MasterCard.
And they have assembled a higher level, it is necessary to make their clients out of the bank now.
"Two large French companies have committed to distribute systematic distribution in the future to their customers a free card bank," Gérard Nébouy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is just the first stage for the future payment: a mobile phone.
NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needed to perform transactions is now only a small number of devices.
"They got the late."
"But their real division should come in the next year."
"For 2012, we consider their sales to 80 to 120 million units in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President Eurosmart.
But the banks are already ready forward.
Bank Agricultural Crédit yesterday reported the launch of the test conducted in Caen, which will take from the farmer to the next year.
The iPhone tools will be equipped by a free-contact payment of approximately 200 clients and co-operation.
Bank BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also announced yesterday that she was preparing to offer a offer that allows her clients to pay a mobile phone free.
Teroristic front of Sahary to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the connections between Al-Kajdo in the Islamic Maghreb and the Section Boko Haram.
Long-term doubts that there are associations with the terrorist group of Al-Kajda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Ministry of Algeria has even admitted that Algeria has made it clear from now.
"The way both organisations operate, and the reports of expert services show that there is a great cooperation between them," he explained without further definition.
It seems that Paris has similar analyses.
In January 2010, study of two French in Nigeria could help to clarify the connecting facilities.
After the AQMI members were taken from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delity had to be killed on the next day at the same time as some of their entities in the operation conducted by special French units.
The French and Nigerian investigators had found several phones with chips of terrorists.
Teroristic Osa
Analysis of calls leads to some people in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to the Radio France Internationale (RFI) station, researchers are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, which has long lived in Maiduguri, the city northern Nigeria, which is the colebie Boko Haram, and the other to a person who says he is close to AQMI and secte.
"It's a progress, but there must be no doubt waiting for more convinced evidence before we start talking about operations and cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But you're possible."
"We already know that the external financial and intellectual support is more active," the peaceful statement of the Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In the past months, this "support" was more and more evident in the development and demonstrations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims or even more complex explosive equipment in the same manner of implementation as the AQMI organizations used.
The international community has developed the pressure in Nigeria since that time to take into account the problems that Boko Haram has taken place.
The Nigerian authorities in the Upperties considered a group of mysticals a little valuable interest.
Quick Success
See Boko Haram was based in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mixture, schools and fundamentalists of Mohammed Yusufa. Boko Haram, which in the Haouss language means "West Education is a sin", admits the detention of the Islamic Emiration in the Muslims north of Nigeria.
This poor region has such success.
It is political and requires a close compliance with the Islamic Rights of Sharia, while its staff start fighting against the Central Government.
These people go first on the bones, bars, and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram's staff remains extremely active and violates their attacks against police stations.
The government's reaction is like usually the same.
The army surrounds the city, and the outcome is 800 dead.
The founder of Mohammed Yusuf sect is able to kill and kill.
Since that moment, the group has been radicalized and left its effect on the north.
On Sunday 2010, Jos’s attention will be carried out in the city of Jos, where 80 people will lose, follow another in the main city of Abuja.
In June, it's again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police leadership at his first self-mord attack.
And in August, the local Office of the United Nations will be the first international district.
The creation of terrorist axes in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned with all security specialists.
Now when Al-Kajda Islamic Maghreb surrounded Mali and Gamer and Somalci from the movement of Al-Shabab operate in Keni, Boko Haram appears as a new danger for the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, when talking with President Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in the state of preparation and ready to "forward all information."
World according to candidates to the President
In the issues regarding China, Iran or Israel's help, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are in a simplification and uncleanness.
Can weak crisis be able to control the world by means of simple or even simplifying thoughts?
When the president's candidates listened, the electors could think about it.
A few days of Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other repeated holiday statements and structural advertising in the case of employment policy, which is already traditionally a strong point of the republicans.
Often unsubscribed words about China, Iran, or helping Israel in the midst of themselves.
Mitt Romney, the best placed candidate in the republican "Grand Old Party", threatened the authorization of Chinas from the World Trade Organization and their accusations "k for the manipulation of their currency", which is the subject of the whole part of its future in America in Asia.
That worse, if this has to include the launch of business war in itself, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Ancient Obam's highlighter in China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of the policy, almost dismissed at the position that "approval" emotions.
He requested a strong but strong dialogue with Peking (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's at the last places in the electoral reviews, remains unhearted.
To the picture of the President Reagan
Romney also promised military duties to Iran, if they did not succeed in arresting his nuclear program.
"If I'm chosen, I'll catch Iran," he said fanfaronically.
"If Obama is selected again, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase the military assistance to Israel, accusing Obam that he was deceived in his obligations against this partner.
Business Herman Cain, the second best of the local candidate, shows a trap uncertainty of documents.
Recently he urged a warm position against the Chinese military threat, because Peking's trying to develop nuclear capacity" - evidently unbelief that China's own atomic weapon since 1964!
Texasian Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants anger against Iran, says that it is ready to send American army to Mexico to fight drug cards.
It is also recommended that Cain, Perry and the other candidate of Michele Bachmann use the torture against the terrorists prohibited in Obama in 2009.
Everyone is far else than the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a difficult weight in the promotion policy.
In contrast with the current president, Reagan also had simple thoughts and still wined a frozen war.
They claim that Obama himself was amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failures of his naive dialogue with Iran, the declined "boys" from Iraq, his excuses concerning Libya, and thus encourage him to be a weak pressure.
But the attack is nothing easier.
The population considers the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Ladina, more positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military forces that lead to destruction.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to rebuild America economically so that I can resume its leading position, obama's screaming to the right place.
Northern Stream, new Russian gas entry to Europe
The remote North Stream gaseoway, which picked directly the East Europe to Russia and led after the day of the Baltic Sea, began to work.
It must add gas equal to 30 million household equivalent.
Gazprom, Russian Plynarium Board, wanted to celebrate this event adequately.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of States and governments, have been involved in the Northern Stream, a new gasway, which is linked directly to Russia and Germany under the sea.
The symbolic German officer Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French ministerial President François Fillon and his netherlands colleague Mark Rutte turned together by controlling around the ventilation of Russian leading gas in the west-European network.
This new gas will begin to pass every year to Western Europe, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas, with the first roof of 1 224 km from the region of Petrohrad with the community of Mecklembury-Sea.
The second cycles to be completed at the end of 2012 will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is a quantity equal to the whole French conversion.
And there is already a possibility to set the third gas trailer on the same road.
Gazprom has temporarily completed this major building character of victory.
In contrast with the project, Poland and the Babylonian countries protested strongly.
Northern Stream will enable direct gas to Germany without being conducted by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will sometimes lose the power: the possibility of pressing Russia by threats to close access to the western European markets is more difficult for them.
The most stronger was Varšava when she wasn't weakening to compare North Stream to the new German and World Pacific, with a revocation to the aliancy between Hitler and Staline at the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say that it's a political topic sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support to this Russian project, has increased the security of its purchases.
But this is the price of the weak energy Europe, since the project has created markets between east and western Europe.
Russia had only 5 years ago made its vision of the direct association between Russia and the rich west countries with high gas-free gases whose beds are close to its end.
"This gaseovod is a directory of our partnership with Russia, a new weapons that are organicly connecting us," François Fillon confirmed in the celebration of this gas and demonstrated the point in which large planning contracts are both political and economic.
This all explains the wide smiles of the leaders of the Gazprom representatives present in a large number in Lumin, the leading place of gas.
The stage of this gas is also a significant technical action.
The sub-sea trumpets are of the beton locked beton floor to be protected from sea vessels.
It is covered at the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 m.
At his building, it was necessary to avoid the Mine Pool to be buried from the second World War.
"For security, they must have been almost a hundred to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Mämer, the speaker of North Stream.
It was also necessary to adjust measures to protect faunas and flowers.
The single tube is a long powder hair valued as 242 Euffelovek, which has no longer been interrupted or ventilated by the holding stations.
One control area should have been built near Sweden, but the leader project rejected it when the Swedish were only a little desire to see the Russian State company as it continued to be in their areas.
"In the case of deficiency, we'll stop the progress of the gas in less than 1 minute," Jens Mämer states.
In the case of disturbance, gas contained in gas will avoid in air.
But this case is considered to be a little probably, that the reactions were proposed so that unfortunateness occurred once in 100,000 years.
The control of the gas status is conducting a subseaker robot of the ship, while the interior of the gas is controlled by the equipment that circles inside.
This equipment of a mixture of 1 meter is introduced into the interior of the tube and is pressed by the gas.
For the purposes of the three days of the road of 3 m/s, accurate information on the casual deformations of metal parts shall be provided.
The remote gasway was proposed to work for fifty years without that it should be a smaller deal.
Circulation of gas is simplely guaranteed by pressure.
The value of this press is 200 bars at the start and 100 bars in the target.
For the implementation of this project, the force of five companies was linked.
The leader position remains Gazprom, which holds 51%.
The German company E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Netherlands company Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies created a common company called Nord Stream, a convinced construction and gas operation.
The company has a seat in Zoug in Switzerland, where the opinion is extremely valuable.
Gazprom finally found this company for five years with a renewable resource, all its capacity for gas transport.
"Gazprom will have a gain from the total capacity, whether the quantity of actually transported gas is anywhere," Jens Mezzar states.
The gas exhibition financing was guaranteed from 30% of the shareholder and 70% of the bank by loans.
The total costs of work should be achieved by 7.4 billion euros for both costs.
For the GDF Suez Group, such investment costs were 240 million.
But minor actors are sure that their costs will be returned, because only Gazprom is risked.
Plynovod is coming from the Baltic Sea in Luminos at the sand town with bovine forests.
The ventilations are a height of 4,5 meters of gas.
The recorders measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the combustion gas before transporting into German gas vehicles.
Since the past attack, this terminal accepts one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When the full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Molecular - Tag recorder
The Italian Moleskine firm, which has been established for fifty years ago, wants to show joy again in writing.
It brings the hour of goodness, the hours of the light of the light of the light.
The recorder of Moleskin is easily recognized by his black depths and his papers will send white colors as if they were deceased.
Because the writer of Molescan, as we know him today, has been born in 1997.
The Italian business Modo Sitting Modo in Milan will then decide to place a new design, but distinguished recorder on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the consentant working for business, is included in the introduction of a new product.
The recorder is inspired by the old production technology "moleskin" (moleskin) that is used for the correction of the surface of the lawyers.
This type of recorder was very appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Molequines returned to the face of an old and forgotten subject, which was the icon of predgard artists until the 20th century," states Maria Sebregondi, who since that time became a leader of the character of the company Modo Modo.
Success is here.
During 2006 and 2010, the sale was 26% to be set up on 12.7 million cooks last year.
The situation is a remote production from the first years when only 3.000 recorders were prepared.
Molesca exceeds the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's difficult to compose a artificial portrait of the buyer, because we'll take businessmen as a student or a professional.
The image of the Molecular writer is that his owners are people of spacepolitical, cultural, and open spirit.
A small Italian company, who had 12 employees at its starts, has today nearly hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the second in New York.
His writers are sent to the booking and initiatives of the FNAC trade lines to small bottles in the middle of the cities where he was able to identify his identity.
"We followed the spirit of a time and this need for a new writing, through a violent development of e-mails," explains Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural signature provides the development of the writer of Molesca: the recently opened the "Shazka" exhibition, where the artists or artists have made their recorder.
In August, when the film festival in Locarn was available, it also introduced a new recorder's table with leopard.
Molekyna benefits from its success and this cultural auro and diversifys its products: bags, diarrhoea, pigs, surroundings on notebooks ... The label is expanded in a whole range of nosebooks.
Success raised dependence: In 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe's investment funds, today Syntegra Capital, writeing a new page in the history of Molesca.
Why is such a big share of unemployed handicapped work?
Approximately 19 percent of the handicapped people are looking for work.
Today, 15 weeks are opened for the work of the handicapped.
Over the voluntary public policy set in 2005, the percentage of non-employed persons is two times higher than the average, which is 19% exceeding 9% for the whole population.
Is that a rating?
"No, it supports ́ Blanchet, the General Director of the Association Adapt, who organizes the week for the work of the handicapped."
"The progress achieved in 15 years are careful."
"In that time, it wasn't a percentage of unemployment two times, but three times higher."
"It's still still much to do."
It is necessary to say that for non-employed persons who have been handicapped, a long time before they come to work.
It is an elderly person: 37% has more than 50 years (17% in the mean).
They have a low level: 80% have no maturity, and from 2.3 million high school students are only 10.000 handicapped.
Finally, the unemployment is very extended: 53% in the hendikepopulated extent of 38% in the average.
Shortly, these are criteria that are particularly complicated to return to employment and represent "the nuclear of the problem", according to Christian Grapina, the Director-General of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992, to help undertakings accept the endicated work.
So much about the objects of the rain.
There are no words, the ways of thinking that are certainly developing, but too quiet.
In April, IMS-Entregrap for la Cité, questioning managers have a weak level of knowledge of the hendikepowered persons with an overwhelming view of persons on a cruel cross and mental or mental failure.
The consequence is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the objective of employment of 6% of the employees set out in the 1987 Law.
The last known numbers that entered from 2008 are equal to 2.6%.
"Now we move about 3%," says Pierre Bla · General Director of the Agefiph Organization, confirmed by the selection of taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the "country" of enterprises, the same as the payment amounts that have fallen between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 providing companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, which increased the contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Bla. "
"But this improvement also demonstrates true knowledge, especially in the large areas."
According to the Ministry of Work, only 59% of businesses from 20 to 49 employees are employed by 82% of businesses, 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before they call the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the joy that would bring them this friendly challenge.
We're not going so far, and we've written that there was a binding between them, but the image is symbolic.
Stade de France was sitting near themselves at the Court of Justice, and Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard were quickly disappointed.
Five months after his attacker's anger in the fight against Turkey found a Belgian trainer to his player just words of praise.
"I'm very pleased with Eden and his progress, and with his love for his land."
"I want to move forward," assured the French Lille player.
It's about the division between its works in clubs and national men's ships, it's one and the same, it's justifying."
"I'm in Lille all the year, which isn't the case of a complaint."
"I need to clean my mark."
Hazard, investigated against Romania on Thursday evening for this attack against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "search".
Unable to refer to the concept "rada".
Play against Bleus, which has been encouraged since 7 years and in their winning secrets in 1998 and 2000.
"I was a fan," he says.
This needs to contribute more to the "special" character of this meeting.
More about it because it's Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", it's.
"We crossed up immediately."
"I can play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Well-hearted Leekens recalled the "groundness".
"Hrdost" to throw out a "feast" - a festival.
"Hrdost" also states at the quality of "souseds", that France has become a team very high level for more than a year after trauma in the South African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Bla's made a worm of work," he breathed.
Anyway, there will be a mistake in Europe's next mistery, the technic bath would have seen in 2014 in the aircraft with the French direction... Brazil.
"Our little ones become big," he subscribed.
"We're just building something, players are ambitional, healthy hunger."
"You'll know this about the next storage." In fact, it's contrary to France.
Portugal very self-conscious
The Portuguese Church Paulo Bento starts with a great optimism bargage against Bosnia (22:00) this center in Lisbon.
During the road there, both teams missed realism.
"In the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and mostly a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
It does not exist any degree of doubts. The Portuguese Balance Representative, whose food is since 2010, is ≥ EUR 2012.
Portugal works for happiness in 90 minutes.
There remains a cup and one co-country - Bosna.
At the house of the Pacific Exhibition (0-0) in the Bossen Zenice Peak, it seems that nothing has been gained.
Portugal certainly had more than a hour of overview, but it was not able to give such a rare → that would take him.
"It's a good result that, however, contains the risk, because we didn't get outside."
But at their invasive Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they are dealing with a public that would have to create a heavy catch there, even though the storage is determined as "very equilibred," says optimist, but beautiful Bento.
"We're expecting a very balanced ship, but we're completely convinced that we can have an advantage," said the Portuguese trainer.
"We still have 50% of the chance to be for Euro 2012," he related to the following Carlose Queiroze.
Unresolute feedback in Bosnia offers Portugal to give and win.
An unresolved stock may be sufficient to the Bosnians who are also able to give §.
"It's a good result that, however, contains the risk because we didn't get out of here," Bento claims.
"We will play against a team with a large technical quality and available players with large individual qualities," added.
Like in Zenica, Portugal will have an interest in developing the Bosnian team immediately since the beginning of the maximum pressure, so that they will not have time to think."
Good idea, under the undermining that this time it's going to be realistic.
