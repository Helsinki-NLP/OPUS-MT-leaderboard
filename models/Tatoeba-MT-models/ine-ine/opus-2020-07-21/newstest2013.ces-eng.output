Recurrence of the Republic of Obama
The Republican leaders rejected their policy for the need for combating electoral undertakings.
However, Brennan's centre indicates that the electoral underwater is less frequent than the number of persons who die after the bleeding.
Republican lawyers finally in the past ten years have only been assigned to 300 cases of elections in the United States.
One is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election.
In this sense, these measures will partly subscribe the American Democratic System.
In the case of Canada, it has a responsibility for the organization of federal elections of individual States.
And in this spirit, the American governments have announced the new laws which deploy the election or writing process in the election list since 2009.
This was a significance of the elections in November 2010, during which 675 new representatives of the Republic of 26 States arrived.
In 2011, only 180 persons were presented to the laws of restrictive electoral rights in 41 countries.
The new election law requires the electoral to present a demonstration of identity with photographs and documents on the American State State.
Furthermore, these laws restrict the periods for preliminary elections, dismiss the right to write to the list of electors on the day of elections and derogate the optional right to the citizens with the entry in the criminal register.
Before elections in 2006, he did not require the electors to provide an indication of identity with photographs of any American state.
The State who made this request was Indian.
The State of Indian law confirmed in 2008 the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Republican authorities have accelerated the extension of this procedure and to the remaining States.
In the last two years, such laws in 34 countries were supported with the aim of providing electors to present the evidence of identity with photography.
It is necessary to note that the American citizens do not have an universal identity demonstration, such as a health insurance card.
In the rate of 11% of the American citizens, namely 21 million people in the ability to choose, no evidence of identity issued by the Governing Authority of their state.
There is no such demonstration of identity about five million new electors in 2012.
Moreover, the order for the requested identity show is often more than one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are inappropriately affected mainly by young, minority members and lower income.
25% of African people, 15% of people with receipt under 35,000 dollars; 18% of the 65 years older citizens and 20% of volunteers in 18 to 29 years, therefore, they do not have a requested show of photography identity.
And that's not all.
Students who are like electors who know their access to democratic candidates are not authorised in some countries to use their identity shows with photographs made by their school.
On the other hand, the Members of the Lake or of the fishing clubs, who choose more of the Republican candidates, allow cards made by these clubs to use for elections.
By 2004, no State has requested a document on citizenship.
The request was made by Ar’n.
Since 2011, there were approximately twelve states of the law which lay down the obligation of voters to show that they are American citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is also necessary to note that two of the three of the Holy Ones gives the priority of the democratic side.
The Republican legislators in 2011 supported in eight states the legislation which breaks the record of electors on the day of elections.
Moreover, they limited the right of people and groups to provide assistance to electors who want to write.
This restriction has its results.
For example, during the general elections in 2004, the campaign for the recording of walkers helped to register approximately 10 million people.
The care adopted after 2009, but made a decrease in recording new electors in 2010 by 17% above 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted the laws imposed in the next five countries for the decrease of the period of elections in the preliminary manner.
For example, during the general elections in 2008, in Florida, 33% of African electors who called forward, although African electors in this country were only 13%.
It was the same to His's.
They created only 11% of all walkers, but 24% of the citizens voting before.
On the other hand, the white ones who represented 76% of all the electors were created only 46% of the electors who were calling in front.
In contrast with the approval of the laws limited to the registration of electors, they have, of course, very clearly established democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratics have locked their vete a few of the laws.
With a view to maintaining the validity of the most controversial laws, the general prosecutor of the United States has even collected.
The damage often made them limited.
For example, the laws required to provide an indication of photography were accepted only 16 of 34 countries.
However, the new rules set out are increasingly difficult in the exercise of voting rights in 2012.
Democracy critics are particularly referring to the prevention of the approved laws and consider them evidently attempted to influence the results of elections in 2012 in key States.
The report of Brennan’s Centre of 2011 shows that the States where these laws were approved represent 171 of the 270 votes in the assembly of electors necessary for victories in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare that these legislative changes at the election system will have a significant impact on the elections of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is certain today: these new provisions will have an increasing impact on election.
In this sense, these measures will partly subscribe the American Democratic System.
Discovery of the cancer: to resolve the investigation or not?
PSA test brought leckdy wrong results that were wrongly negative or even wrongly moved, which resulted in unfair medical progress.
All of this has increased the weight of men who have already been looking like this for investigation.
Leave your investigation or not?
We asked for two experts' opinion.
In the studies conducted in the United States, a high level of contamination between individual tested groups has been demonstrated, therefore it is difficult to interpret these results and to bring a valuable recommendation.
Another study, this time European, has established a different mortality between patients who have undertaken investigation and those who have not gone on them.
This study also showed after 12-year-old degree that those who do not investigate have 30-40% higher risk of metastase result.
So I recommend an investigation from 50 years of age or from 40, if your direct family had a cancer of prostitution.
The most threatened group is also African powder men.
The key is to make the correct decisions when the cancer is discovered.
There are aggressions and types of cancer and such kinds that are inappropriate.
Therefore, it is necessary to explain correctly to the patient the risks of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not to treat the needed cancer of prostitution that does not have an impact on life in the horizont, and to focus in these cases more on the active monitoring of disease.
Today, a number of men who have been cancered are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggression and does not threaten them to life.
Moreover, we will give them an active supervision and we will offer them treatment in the case of the disease progress.
We are still more frequent and more accurately defined by the criteria helping to decide what kind of treatment and which not.
However, I recommend the investigation to resolve.
However, it is important to resolve a conversation with your doctor and to determine whether the appropriate investigation is to be subject to or not.
In cooperation with the International Urologic Company, the movement of Movember has made a tool that allows to evaluate for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in the research, it seems to be the best to limit the risk of the adoption of the principle of healthy life.
It is estimated that if everyone eats healthy and moves enough, it should be advanced to 30% of the cases of cancer.
"If everyone stopped fucking, this data would be at least 50%," supported André Beaulie, the Canadian speaker for cancer research.
Instead, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer disease causes parentality.
Some percentages also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against railways remains a priority, even though the number of bullies fall.
The cigarettes are worth 85% of the cases of bleeding cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several other.
It's intimately harmful for human health.
"There's still 1,5 million bullets in Quebec," he's crossing the head of the speaker André Beaulie.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the crash stops smoking, the risk of death for half cancer is lost.
Mass
Electricity and obesity are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for the result of disease.
Increasing the risk of bleeding cancer, dark tree and fingerprint, egg, slips and workshops.
"The research shows that the regular physical activity is protecting from the cancer of the dark tree throughout life," adds the message.
Injection
The organisation also recommends limiting the deterioration of red flesh.
In excessive disturbance, it may lead to increased risk of color-electral cancer.
It is appropriate to make sure that it applies to the same.
Conservation of meat may lead to the creation of carcinogenic substances by weight, sugar or sole.
"They can cause the body cell damage and lead to the development of cancer," adds the report.
Vitamine
At the last time, different persons were focused on the connection between vitamin supplies and cancer.
However, the conclusions have not yet been concluded.
The vitamin E-based is distributed according to SCC.
Although, according to one of them, a reduction of the risk of the cancer of the cancer is made, other studies speak more about its increase.
No vitamin D for cancer is shown uniquely.
Mr. Beaulie continues to keep on how important it is to talk about your concerns and concerns from your family with your doctor.
"The study doesn't mean you're gonna have cancer."
Higgs' bosson examinated
A notice of the probably discovery of Higgs' boat called the wheel in the summer.
There is a view that this bosson is shared in the mechanism that is responsible for all vessels in the universe.
And this is the last part of which the existence provides the standard model - our best or "only bad" explaining the weight and the behavior of the weight - which has not yet been observed.
However, between physicals, there is not yet a gradual sure that it's about Higgs' boss.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new part available that looks very like Higgs' bowl, as it is prescribed by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the great physical congress in Kyot are further confirmed, but there are no data yet, and they could have absolute security.
Nevertheless, let's assume that it's about Higgs' bosson, because the risk of myil is like a small, and let's see what it's actually going on.
In this world, there is an uncertain law that two things cannot be made at the same time at the same place.
This rule can't be obliged - and don't try too selfishly, else you'll hurt.
Although the partitional physics is a very wonderful world, it is shown that it also applies to the obscure law: Pauli's exclusional principle that two parts cannot collect the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quant status" - this "state" size is designed to create some of their properties.
Further parts of the physics are divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find arrangemented citizens, or fermions, who are obedient to Pauli's principle.
And at the second end, the bottles are moved, according to anarchists that do not appreciate anything - so, of course, not this principle, which means that they can be quietly at the same place at the same time.
The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley's laboratories, continues to share in two groups according to the equipment (with a completely eye), which is the Particle Adventure, which is in Berkeley's laboratories: the meals that we leave here without attention, and the "force parts" of which large natural forces are spread, and with which Higgs's boson is probably closed.
However, it is necessary to say that these bottles are not such exotic animals as I would think.
Reading this article, it's grateful to the bowl with an inexplicated banal: photon, or "parts of lights", which is the "noise" electromagnetic power.
When the same parts with the electrical pool get or change their direction, it "reduces" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, as the obscure of the fisheries.
From this "exhibition" the electromagnetic wheel (light, infrared or ultraphillic sample, etc.) and this wheel is nothing else than photo - and then one of the bossons, "the power weighters".
More Stable Fields
It's also with Higgs' boss, just with the difference that "extract" is needed to be another field, the Higgs field to open this bosson.
This Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to its excitation, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, as in the mild fishermen's levels, which is already a very large ballon.
From this point, it is necessary to use such a significant part-builder as a CERN lab - a big hatron-builder with entertaining connections is a circle of 27 km! - to be able to develop such energy.
Analogies with the electromagnetic field are going to explain the relationship between Higgs and the weight.
However, not all parts or materials are responsible with the electromagnetic field.
Some, for example, magnetics, do so, but others do not - a paper cuss, for example, never will be able to keep yourself on the island.
And it also applies that with the Higgs field they do not respond all the parts: those who do so have a certain weight, while the final (e.g. photons, let's see it) are not.
And Mrs. Novak's wondering what all these research are, "we'll bring us"?
In view of this case, the validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to determine any non-compliance between observation and SM predicts.
Moreover, a number of physicians wants to succeed, because the self-minder difference could open the "new physics" Chamber and heat some ranges in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model has a major deficiency, does not provide any interpretation of gravity (oha!) or dark weight that creates about 80% of the universe weight (ohh! again).
However, the CERN device has not been discovered until now.
Reply
The responses of these research in the daily life of Mrs and Mrs. Novaks can only be very difficult, however, it would be a mistake to think that there is no one.
Look: At the beginning of the 60s, the lazers were not in the Bell Laborators or the consciousness of the revolution that their work is already calling.
They assumed the use of decade, but nothing else.
The physics of Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was found in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser paper (previous papers were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said that - laser was first considered such a "player in the lab".
Just imagine that...
Moreover, the application can also exit from all tools that survive research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light recorder in 1969 during his optical work.
This recorder, although Boyle did not first plan so, now serves as "o" of all digital cameras in the world and has made Nobel the price for physicality in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around LHC need to change our life, but that means that man never knows...
Paliative care - The best way to get out of life... → Le Devoir
In the middle of its Commission for a greater death, Quebec has recently participated in the collapsed issues relating to the end of life.
The debate should continue immediately, and at the same time the law should be discussed.
In this principle, there is still a lot of jobs.
The period Le Devoir tried to look at this question more detailed.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The cancer of the cancer that she fed her gave him a two-year depth.
"They gave me five years of life, and it's already seven," he says without emotions on his bed in the house for the paliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he came the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: Intimidated weakness is able to take himself to the toilet or only to eat himself.
It's rezignously looking at the slightly watching dinner and agreeing to help him eat.
He is courageous and even smiles, talks with the unknown who stops, brings him medicines, offers a buy.
Consciousness to normal death.
"My biggest desire is to get out of the prey, he humbles me," he believes.
In a few hours after, he found the team of the doctors on his problem.
"In the whole life, a man learns that the guys are powerful," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the child's phase, it's for some people inaccessible humility.
"Depends on the ability of a man," if the return is accepted, the psychologist says.
According to the opinion of a number of persons who are paliatively concerned, the primary moments will be played in the single nuclear of such return.
Patients who come home with paliative care of Victor-Gadbois are suffering with cancer.
Their predict is at least three months of life.
In this stage, the team of doctors and sisters who care for them does not provide such a "treatment" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years, it's the worst fear of dier "for the rest of the whole home".
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I don't have any desire in my life anymore," he says, "and then he's powerful, and he's set up a spirit device.
Nevertheless, in the following days, the last visit of the son of Italy is still more happy.
In Victor-Gadbois's house, in collaboration with the group of volunteers, care for the body with survival.
So it looks like a paliative care that comes, if it can't do anything else.
That death would be more convenient.
In Quebec, one bowl looks like paliative care for 11 700 people.
It's very little if we realize that we're all gonna die once.
Here life continues in optimal points, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
What it is about the level of physical, emotional or spiritual advice.
When a man dies, for example, he can give him a brand or a pepsy, according to the crazy.
The diabetes don't need to keep the cold sugar anymore.
And death is part of everyday life here.
They brought a bird to Mr. X. last night, who started died in the night.
Today, his son's beer will be honored by his dead father.
"We help patients as close to them," Nathalie Savard, manager of career service.
In Victor-Gadbois's house, they're going after one another, but they don't like each other.
Nearly 30 - year - old man who is happy from the last meeting with his family accurately placed on pools, while joining him to his honor, a tragic sixty - year - old man died by his parents, wife and two small children after he tried all the opportunities to survive.
"For half of the year there are three to five lips that are designed for people with cancer to 45 years," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to paliation care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians simply have no access to paliative care, i.e. to care that is intended to measure the suffering as a disease grows into the final phase of their life, whether it is home, in the hospital or in the career house.
And a number of organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Home Paliative Treatment of Grand Montréal, are specialised more less exclusively to care for oncological patients.
And just this primary health care not available in Quebec is that a number of doctors specialised for paliative care are concerned of the adoption of the law on eutanase and assisted suicide.
Since October, manifest is signed in paliative treatments, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, where they are incompatible with such initiatives.
According to the doctor Christiane Martelov, there is no cheese health system sufficiently implemented to ensure access to all persons to quality paliative care before they agree with the implementation of eutanase.
As it states, she has recently survived a patient who has spent 14 days in a major pain without making any needed steps to take her away.
It is afraid that patients don't ask for death from that defect that they do not care properly.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last time without regard to an unprecedented predict.
On the survival of Helena Richards, she was totally minimal when she left the chemotherapy.
When I announced that I'd finish the treatment, she replied that she was sorrowing that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And then she told me that it was the end!
There is no powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who want to die thanks to their medical doctors for not fulfilling their desires when the paliative drink team mixed their pain.
But it is necessary to say that the paliative care is not absolutely universal in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, paliative care directors in the Community for homepalm care of Grand Montréal, patients are preventing the treatment of pain in 8% cases.
At the same end of life, doctors often use paliative sedatives that the patient sleeps to the moment of the screen, or that the sedatives are given to him for a long time.
We can't imagine that we don't have this part of suffering.
The one we do not have pain will still have the opportunity of access to the paliative sedatives.
The sick who doesn't have a sedative, they say, "I want to die."
But it doesn't need to mean "I want you to give me eutanase," it means "I want you to save me from pain."
This report enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extended realistic scandals in Quebec
Travel Officers, building and public workers, the lobbyists of the political parties and experts in the Italian mafia are still reporting what they have to do about the "sem", where building, state officers, policies, experts and mafians are mixed.
This "work" came to the Quebec tax payers very dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has been divorced since the time we've adopted basic measures," says Ironic Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec lawyer and former police boss in Montreal.
In 2011, the scandal was scanned on the basis of an evaluated survey based on the manufacture of the stakeholders in relation to the exhibition of roads in Quebec, which then the Liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest approved until after long depths.
The "Duchesneau's report" confirmed the direct connection between the future, the intransparency financing of parties and the corruption of the State officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport on a billion dollar prohibitions," when some people kept on their instincts to share them!
Charbonneau's committee "which has brought two older ones to the demission," adds to the opinion that it will be made to "detect some people's luxuriance."
Constant unit for the fight against corruption based in 2011
The continuous entity for the fight against corruption based in 2011 is also involved in combating its army of government controllers, investigators and analyses.
To this end, the police of the "Marteau's family" who have made the shower "socket of money" clearly measured the inflation of the prohibition...
In the last weeks, they have performed a series of views and have deceived a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, an elder of a foreign.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just went away from his older foreign Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
It is obvious that he has repeatedly accepted taxes by exchange for public prohibitions.
Formal accusation has already been received from Montreal and Italian companies, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito called a feeling when the Commission explained the mechanism "sâem" to obtain public prohibitions.
He owned the 3% value of the prohibition in Montréal during these years, to the architect associated with mafia, who then transferred money to Union Montréal, who was not candidate to the senior Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was stumbled over $88,000 in Canadian (approximately 68,000 euros) by the provincies, but especially the liberals that were at that time.
He also recognized that he organized illegal funding for the former liberal premises of Nathalie Normandeau.
Prohibitions with money carriages of which the prices were based on
In Montreal, the corruption worked very clearly.
Gilles Surprenant, former transport engineer, described it very detailed before the Commission: for ten years he received from the building company of gifts, invitation to flights, golf tours, restaurants, hokey storages and cottons for a total of $736.000 to exchange for money charges in which he was based on the price.
Other public factors of transport have admitted that they have allowed payments to pay for 30% to 40% to overevaluate the factures by uncertain multi-operations.
Martin Dumont's agency organizer then accused Tremblay that he had without delay appealed over the current budget, which brought money to his staff.
On the basis of these discovery of Tremblay, at the beginning of November, he was delayed by Montréal in a large crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first demonstral lawyers who issued a warning signal.
As a company of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, since 2010, it is contrary to the sale of the general land purchased for $5 million and sold by... 1.6 million promotors directly to the flowing trade with unnecessaryness.
70% of spending money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be started, says that "you are trying to understand the functioning of the promoted morving system to stop the gangrene and win winners."
The process is "worry, but positive."
We are at the cleaning stage, but it is necessary to set up its own investigation unit in Montréal and to make sure that these doubtful practices cannot return.
It's like he's getting out.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public factors have dismissed hundreds of millions of dollars," but it is particularly afraid of the role of "masters informed about this lack," if they haven't been helped in these chars!
It recalls that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Quebec comes from spending money, and adds with ironie, "I have heard it's just a weak relief."
The Quebec Government intends to limit the donations to 100 dollars, but it does not say, "When the electoral expenditures are extremely limited, the money of the policy will not be lost."
It provides a complex control of the public prohibitions and financing system: "We can't do anymore; if we are strongly focused on things, we can rebuild on stronger basis and more control and compliance with laws."
Duchesneau recommends all who smile to him to look at his own court...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this case, you and PSG have set up a completely new time.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by all individuals to themselves, or by a completely new PSG dimension.
They came to us a big player.
Every day I'm getting close to them.
The technical team also helped me too much.
Each day, I am allowed to increase the level of game.
And it's easier at the bags.
Everything's going to be terrific in the area.
I'm not doing my head.
From my starts in the preparation in INFirefontaine until after I went to Saint-Etienne, I considered a single degree.
So you're using the competitive rubber that Carlo Ancelotti has introduced...
The posts of this year are usually playing a very high level.
They also know that every train is essential.
And from that results that a player like me has the greatest fun and wants to give a maximum performance.
And too, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much about my position.
He's got an assistant to his hands like Makelele, who played on the same place as I.
And Ancelotti has a word that decides at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the technicians.
Today, it is not equal to the first line and belongs to the best European trainers.
He has great experiences, and he has a lot of titles with spike teams.
He worked with great players.
I think he wins more titles in Paris.
In January, I decided a calm conversation with him.
I had a lot of hurt behind me.
The trust he gives me is the next part of my exercise.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG?
In the first line, Lyon collected our head position.
But we're staying in the middle.
One of our main goals is the Liga of Masters: we have been very easily processed in the oxyfinal.
What does your club do in this competition?
We're going to go next.
Whatever happens can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a hard support for the quality of European teams.
We first want to win our actor group before the Port, and they could play in the osmifinal room.
Can the PSG be in a short-horizont of a large European club?
It's already going to start it...
To become a large European club, Paris must win titles and write in the history.
It's not like this today.
The PSG has the financial side to achieve this purpose.
And would there be a big failure to win in the 1st ligue as in the lows?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
We're going to win a lot of years.
We've missed enough in the neighborhood.
We were disappointed in May because we had to do it, and we won.
We had a good friend.
We collected 79 points.
Of course, you're a master with 79 points...
But another Club, Montpellier, had a more accurate club.
I think it's gonna be done for years.
Although a great team, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have a gun available, and we've hurt them.
Do you think PSG media expect too much?
It's not unusual to wait from us much because of what was invested here and what we have players.
That's what we're accepting.
It's the fact that when we hit Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something that they're counting in the news, it's not just a pleasant thing.
A man asks what people still want more of you.
Of course it's not going to win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to keep the herni.
You're time to build a team.
In Lisa, we proved that we could play.
Look at Manchester City, who hasn't been trying to eighty-year, and then they have also invested great amounts!
In view of invested sums, you would be able to wait before the last 15 points of shopping!
That's what you're doing with the final clubs and the French league.
The Clubs of Lyon and Marseille, which were not too far in the low, moved to another stage with the new PSG.
This shows how the 1st liga is incompatible.
I hope we'll be able to smile in May and say that despite all difficulties, we have been able to win.
It seems to be PSG's in all the works of the Golden Ibrahimovic.
It's good to say there's a "dependence on Zlatan".
That means Ibrahimovic is very executive and he gives a lot of people.
That's why he came here and shows that he's a star of the first body.
Everywhere he passed, he showed that he was a big player, a world star.
We respect humans and players in our team.
He also respects people around him.
What he achieved is really exceptional.
It also led the finals to increase their own level of games.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the best dealers in the world, also allows the final growth around it.
How did you enjoy the Euro 2012 with the French representation?
It's like a disappointment.
I wanted to play on this tournament.
Unfortunately, for hurt, I couldn't play as I could imagine.
But I lived it, and I went out of it stronger.
Today, I can play a good storage in the representation.
And I've already hoped that from my approach to representation.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and we today deserve ourselves to be appropriate for our presentation.
How are you looking at Didier Deschamps in the head of the National Team?
They're talking about the outcome.
We're on the good place in the MS.
The trainer's choosing angry, it's nearby to players and can take up for winning.
That's how Laurent Bla.
I don't want to compare them.
Blaʹ has reached his goal by we've been on the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is the remise (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid standard?
This warrant gave us self-conscious.
We were all fighting for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't survive such a stock for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without bank
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for the processing between the beneficiary.
As these are, it is also often true that it is a manifest political view: convincement that the existing financial system based on bank monopols leads to financial crisis.
Bitcoin, whose finder is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonim), represents the money (but translated to dollars, eura...), a so safe translation protocol similar to BitTorrent that allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers already registered nearly 200,000 transactions.
There are some thousands of websites already accepting bitcoins as gifts or as payments.
The bitcoin curse first reached $30 (23) in June 2011, about five months later falling to $2, currently moved to the border about $10 (curs view is listed on the page of bitcoincharts.com).
In comparison with the world exchange for real money or financial products, it is nothing impressive.
Yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this responsibility in its report on the employment funds that has been issued in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful money", "concurrent dollars and euros" and "the period of running money".
Bitcoin is different from the final types of maritime money by using it as "credits" for the process in the video game that man gets a game or which can buy (and leckdy and change).
The Facebook social network also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the Central Authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all of the repositories of the books of running books, controls, emissions of money and buyers and sales.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two operators is running between two electronic addresses using e-mail.
However, the user may choose another address for each payment which ensures anonymity.
The information file relating to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can verify the rights of transaction.
Thanks to the file area, it is possible to ensure that changed bitcoins exist in the public book of running features distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is recorded in this new transaction in this book.
Trying to resolve the mathematical task given to computers whose resolver, as a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the stage of the file resolution; it is the transformation of a large file to a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers will take this new transaction and add a number to it, and then the whole "search".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (a lot of zero at the beginning).
When this number is found, the ends will easily check his rightness.
The transaction will then be unexpectedly shown on the row of all final transactions; any adjustment would be made to change the printing.
The holder would like to pay the same money two times a lot of money for itself (to 10 minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the second will be left because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to preach inflation, this payment is regularly due to two, probably until the end of 2012.
The start of bitcoin in the run is so limited to the number of 21 million, but it can be divided to the stomillion, so the Marge room is here...
The difficulty of the assigned task is also increased by the increased calculation rate.
The network has already survived her excitements and falls.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and reached to decrease the stored bitcoins.
"The useful currency does not apply to the protocol alone," Pierre Noizat, which founded Paymium, a company for payments that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of spending money through this anonymous service.
But this problem is also paid for preparation.
Significant players like Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this power.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Sha and Dorit Ron from the Weizman's station in Israel recently analysed the book of running and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins were not able to be able to be able to be able to do so.
In November, the "speaks" were started.
"Treven thousand dollars have been changed," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul with a conversion of bitcoin to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of the pedagogical books relating to these money, has great confidence in the potential of this character as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with money) or an uncontakt payment mobile, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions which are more favorable to it.
Moreover, the owner is controlling his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set to businesses where new terminals or software are not required.
It's enough to communicate the address that can be "fotographed and split" by the phone, explains Pierre Noizat, which makes sure he already has thousands of people.
The general movement is to doubt the hierarchic systems and the transition to the more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin comes out, it still takes a while, but it may be decided in 2013," she predicts.
In its report, the ECB provides for the review of different risks today considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We've gone from Afghanistan.
What else?
The French units left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and American units should follow the end of 2014.
It's time for the Afghanistan Army to overcome control over their territory and the Afghanistans to choose their own future and not to wait for everything from us.
The biggest intimacy of people suffered in the Afghanistan foreign, which we sinned, because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, came about 88 murdered soldiers, and what all of them are hurtful and disgraced.
The Taliban are composed of extremistes, former leaders of representatives who went to Pakistan, but often refers to adults who reject the presence of the military as in the Soviet times.
They just want to protect their ancient and archaetic traditions, even though the gyhadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Uzbek, Tadjik.
Today, tolerants and often help local resurrected ones, but if western forces get down, their support will be reduced.
The department of French units from the foundation of Niirab, which I followed from the tops of the mountains of Mandlone, thanks to the French payments, was arranged.
The conversion of trucks and panzered vehicles arrived in Kabul without attack for the air transport of helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Talibans are so active in Kabul.
Since their insufficient procedures in 1994 to 1996, subminations have been significantly changed.
Cabul was empty at that time, and the land was in blood and fire in the light of wars between different relief groups.
Their control over the land was then considered to be a kind of freedom, a return to security.
The Afghanistans paid the price for the darkness of those foreigners who were completely controlled by the Al-Ka'id organization, but their ability has not been improved in our time.
Some Mudjahedin, the Afghanistan government and the modern Taliban are agreed to keep women in a subordinated position.
The votes of the war against the Soviet units returned to power in 2001.
They became leaders, strengthened the state areas which were sold as building lands of Iran and Pakistan, and used the major American prohibitions for subleverants.
They discredited themselves; the number of them had never been in battle.
According to what I heard in campaigns, people want the government that they're going to make evil.
A number of youths want to leave as they will go away those who have been able to use American welfare: the uncle is significant.
Young people are already engaged in the war and the ideology associated with it.
During the outcome of Iran or Pakistan, the modern world was known and his benefits were rebuild.
Approximately 65% of the population is less than 25 years; in Kabul, 5 million people are now living, 5% of the total population.
In towns, state schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need to provide jobs, they do not want to return to the darkness of the former sides or to the corruption of some representatives.
All, including armed oppositions, have mobile phones; televisions and Turkish series that show modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Should the offices that will be placed in her head be considered legitimate?
Some leaders of the fight against the Soviet Army have already renewed the provincial mile that will be without the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, the country with a strong influence of local identity, should be satisfied with certain decentralisation in the model of West States, but the United States wanted to change it into centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the premises position that had already existed since the establishment was adopted in 1964.
The President of Karzai does not want the control of the operation, especially when the elections are planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been extremely dependent on aid in the past 50s.
No progress could be renewed, no overburn functions, no principle inflammation system is performed.
Everything is imported; nothing is done, only fruit and greenine.
The priority has a private initiative.
Three decades of wars in the country would be necessary for government control of infrastructure.
They have been informed that Afghanistan has a major irrelevant richness.
And it just experienced the feeling that the western states were here just because they could strengthen it.
Without energy for the processing of rail rounds or mixtures in the place and without cups for the transport of sugar over the mountain, but no weight of nervousness can be carried out.
The Chinese have already left the middle of Mes Aynak and have left the international archaeological teams (for the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to examine a large buddhist area in order to maintain the role of the most important employees in the entire province.
On one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which the large part of imports and exports depends on, will also need to restore normal relations.
The decline of French war units was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of running types of aid: girls and boys, French category at universities, French institution, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support of the Archeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative was to "seek heart and soul" attempting to provide an inevitable task for help and military activities, whereas the "civic and armed steps" of the Defense Ministry (Cimic), which was canceled in 2012, but has reached thanks to the unclean French non-governmental organization of success in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in the ten mountain villages.
These works that included the number of local workers have helped to lose upstairs: inflation, fountains, drinking water, covering, fruit trees, land protection and processing areas.
What billion euros have we left for military expenditure?
Much more modesty budget would contribute to improve local living submissions, which are very significant in these works that are often in the oversea height of more than 2 000 m.
Wellislanect received decades of written applications for a major agricultural aid from local communities in Capisa.
In order to make these agricultors free from the resurrected groups, they wish to achieve intimate citizens' assistance in their benefits, which would be correctly controlled and directly touched them.
Difficulty work in Egypt
President Muhammad Mursy left to the next part of the poker.
While Egypt remains most divided in his history because of the statement of an institution which temporarily gives him an unlimited power, he decided to play a vaban.
In the center, he notified without prejudice to the opinion of all the finals that the Constitutional Constitutional Conservation will approve the final version.
A few weeks ago, the head of the State has granted this reservation two months later to complete the necessary works.
There are two years of use of the provisional text of Egypt, which has been added many times, which reduces the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal investigations.
This new initiative has continued to strengthen the diversity of the country.
From the view of the opposition, the President keeps in his "autocratic part", continues to "building his word" and "whispering the right."
However, his staff are assured that it's about the way I'm not going to fight with the constitutional and political crisis and to carry out a transitional process.
In two weeks, referendum should be made.
It is a very short period of time that will bring Brothership away from the purpose of the text to the Egyptians to explain the article after the article.
The President also refers to the way to reaching national and democratic legitimacy again, while the whole country dismiss protests.
As he confirmed in the conversation of the American Week Time, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this quickly organized vote is made by the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Be accepting my text, or let me leave the unlimited powers," which should otherwise end after the approval of the new establishment.
And in this special air last night, 85 cases of the constitutional conference with a large majority of islamists have approved the text.
Most liberals were missing when voting.
In the middle of November, no longer before the establishment was reported, they bought the doors with that they did not have the opportunity to make their opinions.
The authorities of human rights, civil society or religious minorities have imitated their steps.
In order to achieve disabilities, 11 persons from a series of replacements were rapidly supplemented yesterday.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
It is not surprised that the articles of the establishment were often denied.
The commentators continued to stop that one of the lack of disputes was running about... the hours for prayer when some members of the committee believed that hours in the meeting were not correctly organized.
The text on which we voted last night is made out of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, finally, remains compatible with the version of the establishment of 1971 and states that "the principles of the rights of the Sherry are the main source of rights".
The Salafist parties for which the introduction of the Islamic Rights to one of the main requirements had hoped that the term "based" would be replaced by the term "the rules", which would enable more closer application.
For islamics, the fact that this article is not made, it represents a sign of their good will and respect for the final part of the Egyptian company.
"Cryptisms", the liberals, who see just a Greek problem in it.
According to them, the islamization of the institution is conducted by other articles.
They are addressed, in particular, to Article 220, which believes at the University of the Advisory Role of Al-Azhar, in particular for the question of the control of the conformity of laws with the law of the Charter.
According to the Committee on Egypt, the Soèe Pommier is disappointing because "persons authorised to exhibit are not chosen and have no democratic legitimateness.
It can be watched at the beginning of the theocracy."
The fears of liberals are still more reflecting the ability that the next University Rector should be less dead than the existing.
"In the meantime, no particular religious consequences have been shown.
With this position, Egypt remains a citizen State.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulam, but university workers, a number of them studied in French schools," the peaceful concern of Alexis Blouet, who prepares the work for the constitutional transition in Egypt.
They agree, however, that "the resolution can be identified in relation to the explanation of Article 220, because the relevant terms in it belong to the religious speaker.
There is a link here in particular to "fiqh" [islamic legislation, p. red].
And in the future, the question can be found in which way civil judges are competent to express it."
The text approved yesterday is very criticised outside religious pages by the extensive powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood takes care of their extreme limitation to exempte the former regime.
Next sportive place: the powers of the trusted army.
In accordance with the desire of the representatives of the military, the budget is to be verified to carry out Parliament, but the National Council of Defence.
Thereafter, in military courts, civilians have been prohibited, as it requested for a human rights protection association.
This association refers to its doubts in relation to the text intended to be against freedom.
The contents of breathing are maintained and the injury is continued to be prohibited, which may have serious effects for freedom of expression, especially for printing.
Furthermore, no article remains protected by a woman, highlights Heba Morayef from the Human Rights Watch Organization.
It believes that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous instance.
While the Egyptian president had to go out in television last night, manifestations were planned today afternoon.

"Great and powerful" will announce to Moscow: Emigrants will shoot money in language
While Members and human rights protectors are still discussing the law on the obligational language tests, sub-countries in the country have already been discovered that sell the "supported" certificates
To Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities, 13 million are annually able to work.
Most of them are citizens in Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support the family home.
On the 1st day, the Law entered into the laws that every worker migrant should be able to make a test from the knowledge of Russian language.
This rule shall be applied only to those intended to work in the sector of services, housing and community, life and small business sales.
FMS, however, promises that at times the relevant tests will be required for all visits.
However, tests will be made not only from language knowledge but also from Russian history and the rights bases.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to gain and extend the employment authorisation.
The citizens are only payable to the citizens of the country where the Russian is official.
This law does not obtain people who have succeeded in reaching the testing and obtaining an academic diploma to the SSSR divorce in 1991.
Use, judgment and protection of rights
The network of experimental places will work under the protection of Puškinov the Russian Constitution, the University of Friendship between the nations, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petrohrad and other Russian High Schools.
Migranti can make tests in all cities; now more than 160 such centers are opened in Russia.
The initiative to support testing was also supported by Members of State Dumy and FMS.
But before the law entered into force, human rights protectioners have been able to put a question of many times to print: and what will this bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russia and for a single visit?
In particular, the representatives of the Services are responsible - will allow it to reduce the number of people who suffer in the result of "other work".
Many people today speak about the protection of the rights of migration works, explains the President of the FMS Russian representation in Tadjikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started before their department.
Only the organized set system will allow 90% to solve the problems of workers.
Problems occur in emigrants without calling, without education that don't know the language and have no medical view.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with conviction of Sebelev - is the future migrant judged with unrespected people who will help him to provide "management" in the cruel, closely inhabited places in which he and the tens of others, such as he himself, have been guarding all months without food and documents and bearing for 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migration work, we get a lot of stumble.
"In their authority they promise one, but after the arrival they are undertaken, they enjoy their pass, they don't pay the promised mrss," confirms the leader Hla's Tadic administration work's MS Tolib Scharipp.
Don't hope!
At least, many citizens of Central Asian Republics who intend to work in Russia recognize that they don't only know the language of the country they want to get, but they do not have experiences even with that work.
Of course, it is not even their fault, as more unfortunately: one very little Turkmen, Uzbeka, Tadjikans can be allowed to get at least adequate basic education.
Because their family also wants to feed children, not to speak about the fact that it is appropriate to dress, clothes, and equipment to school.
As children grow into productive powder, they must be reported for work at the first time.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard - acceptable.
"You feel humility and humility."
It is true that, in view of the law on language tests, human rights protectioners show one important thing.
The test will be carried out only for the migrants who have legal position.
They'll have him, they're not going to make any tests, nor will they get any other official work.
Meanwhile, the migration of the work of the works of the people lives in the same way as before in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or unconscious income prohibited"
Many of the incoming works claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
DÍE - birocratic interruptions and all the language difficulties.
Legalisation is more than money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubbles.
But false registration can be obtained only one and half a thousand.
The Russian police officers believe that we have fake documents, without registration, and that's the case of exhibition.
"They require a hundred, two on cigarettes, the tea," he shared with journalists about their experience of the citizens of Tadjikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, sweetheart, buy a malbu."
On the first day of validation of the Language Law, it was found that false would be not only the documents of migrants on registration.
FMS employees have already enjoyed a number of false certificates on the release of language tests.
Packed documents are printed on normal color printing.
Of course, the new owners have not been free: each of the migrants in a naïa that it is so easy to solve tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubblers.
It's two and a half times higher than the issue of the official test: it's going to be a migrational work of three thousand rounds.
The task of the nearest future is to ensure the system of corruption so that workers cannot easily buy documents, in which government officers and human rights protectors agree.
Government authorities may still promise the employees who have not performed the tests for the first time, a time needed to perform the course of Russian bases.
In visiting non-Russian staff, work is expected in non-required active negotiations with people.
MVD (Ministership inside) does not run the illegal weapons market
The part of criminal acts with legally holding weapons is very low
MVD Russia presents us the derogation of the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the cases of shooting on weddings that have been broken without sacrifice, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow Advocate Dimitrium Vinograd, whose success has been destroyed by seven people.
Police wants to prohibit the weapon of dangerous weapons in public places and to increase the rate from which weapon licence can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea supports the head of the Security Court Committee and the fight against the corruption of Irina Jarovaja, which promised that the changes of weapon law would be submitted to the State Home in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied by the Russian State authorities trying to cope with the problem with the way of "shooting of shirubs".
In the network, a open letter was revealed by the authors - representatives of various community shooting organizations - require the refusal of "insensitive violation" of the law.
The percentage of bulligance with registered weapons is minimal, announced by Vasilj Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminal in conversation with the Russian BBC.
According to the Ministry of Industry, 142 criminal acts were saved within six months in 2012 with the use of the shoot weapons registered by the Ministry's authorities inside, while in the same period there were 1168 thousand criminal acts.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the violation of laws in civil weapons does not allow the pachator to go to the "swarm" market.
According to their words, we can find a lower price in Moscow.
At present, the Ministerial Ministry states that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
suppliers: from trailers to coasts
Black market with weapons is reserved to some channels.
The main channels are five, says the Colonel of Victor Baranic, who worked ten years in the School Ministry and the General Charter.
Screenshot page to accept weapons negotiations
Of them is the "arm or military road", that means the weapons that were cut off during the battles in Kavkaza.
"The weapons have stolen also the Russian dusts and the alone cavkazanas," he says Baranic.
Another type of Black Weapons are weapons stolen by criminals in security force representatives.
Baranec explains that there belongs to the claims of police funds and weapons that are stolen directly by the employees of the criminal authorities.
The illegal "great" is added to the sale of military funds.
In many military funds, explosions often occur.
"They have been shown that some fires were placed mentally - to cover the manch," said the former soldier.
They contribute to their contribution, according to the words of Barance and the weapons producers.
"Now, private weapon companies that are not competitive on the international market, and are drawing up weapons that add to the black market in Moskva," said the expert.
Another source of black market is feeding.
Especially a large number of guns and machines comes from poor countries, such as Cyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes the weapons are produced here in a small ship, and the mafia that organized their gas produce," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
Experts have noticed how close the part of individual resources is the delivery of illegal weapons on the "swarm" market.
The report on this problem was processed in 2011 by the Centre of Analysis of Problems and Designing of Public Administration.
The Specialists collected the mandates of the Ministry of Industry and the Russian Statistics Authority, Crimeology and data of public data ports related to these weapons.
The excessive volume of illegal weapons, the investigators, originate from military and executive authorities.
The half of all weapons have been experienced on the black market "official factors whose work is connected with weapons," says the report.
According to data that researchers have available, 17% of weapons from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases have reached weapons in their production, 5% is " Black Archeology".
The seller-conquestant of one of the trading weapons that he requested, and they didn't know his name, is convinced that the weapons found in black "archiology" buy nobody for a long time - are just too old.
The most often, as he says, the sellers are running for new trailers directly to military funds.
The TT gun is buying a unit through the puzzle, for example, the TT gun.
You have a weapon, and he sells it to you through the floor.
"He'll take her into the city and sell it in 900 euros for a cow with two resources," he says.
"P'da is that the police is good in the picture, and therefore, whenever they are going to burn a plan in clarification of criminal acts, they will carry out control purchases in businessers with illegal weapons," adds the adviser.
"It's like in the luxury business"
The sales with the purchasing most often sell each other through their known ones.
I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Test" platform where a man would bring me to the "cook", where we will act together.
I've learned the price primarily until there.
Military rapporteur Viktor Baranec
If you get a weapon, the known who knows the way out, the seller will report - a adviser. - I have such a known man, but I don't trust him completely.
Sellers are on the market, but there is also to go, hypothetics from Mr. Ivan Ivanovice, who asked me to order me that the daughter fell out of the teeth.
And now I'll get there through the man I'm stuck.
He also adds it only to me, because he knows I don't hear him.
Starters are looking for weapons in different ways.
An ancient soldier Viktor Baranic tried to buy illegal weapons in half 90 years when he worked a station to publish this subject.
The schema hasn't changed according to his words.
They gave him the album with photographs, where it was "all as you thought."
"I felt like in the luxual business," he's a soldier.
The boughter, according to the words of Barabbas, doesn't offer to go in the pitch - you can try everything.
I, the potential client, just don't buy-- we're going with the sales in the forest and we'll set it out.
"They give me a chance to shoot, and when I convince you that the weapon is shooting well, we're starting to act," describes the artist's procedure.
Conceptor
Searchers will bring you to the web pages and groups on the "Contakt", where they are offered to buy the weapons "for different weapons".
It does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a specified amount of money," they write in the public title on the web pages "Buy a fight gun or automatic".
On these pages, the recipients dismiss their notifications and ask questions.
And sell unflighted?
"Of course, without license," asked the holder "Ivan" (the writing is stored).
"I'm buying TT.Moskva" -- forms the "Fedorenkov" request.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided a cruel network of web sites and persons who want to buy military weapons may be able to store a lopat.
People go like the hot fish on the floor, and then they're white on Siberia.
Military rapporteur and higher military officer Viktor Baranec
I have heard of these schemes: the web pages were generally registered for the practical activities of Russian laws.
People take negotiations.
Buyer's payment through bankmates.
"In response to this selling photos and a description of the orders where the weapon is hidden," reports the printing speaker's non-governmental organization "Ray on weapons" Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranic confirms that you can stay without weapons and feel out of the networks after the negotiations are assigned.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided a cruel network of web sites and persons who want to buy military weapons may be able to store a lopat.
"The people go up like the hot fish on the floor, and then they're able to go on Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When you buy illegal shoot weapons, you will pay a total of 100 to 900 dollars according to the test of experts.
According to Dmitry Kislova's words, you're ordering the Makarov guns for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for a month and a half of the month.
The weapons shall be issued from the funds to storage through the funds of the Central Article.
According to the Official Statistics Authority, in comparison with the ice - October 2011, the number of these criminal acts in Russia totally had been 7%, and made 22.9 000 cases, and the number of explained cases of currency and exhibition of weapons, shooting, explosion and explosive equipment was decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fastfood and supermarket work is established
The work on the "McDonald" posts to the quarter of all American teenagers
In the last days in America, a wall of protests against low-markets in Walmart's hypermarkets and restaurants of an anniversary clusters, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentdzieky Fried Chicken".
Instead, no one can predict whether this bowl is moving to a nine or whether it is condemned to disappear.
The entire action supports the Committees and a number of Left Community organizations.
In addition to the increase in modesty payments that are achieved by the work of the Walmart and in the systems of trade, the aim of protest organisations is to achieve the creation in their committee organizations.
Currently, this economic sector of practice is an unrelated professional movement.
46 cents per year?
The actions started last week after the Day of Thanksgiving, in such a "swarm Friday", when he hit the orgy of league sales in America, took millions of people, and in some cases, it was also produced by roofs.
On this day, some Walmart's workshops, in which 2,2 million people work over the world, left their work and demonstrated together with the committees and links activities of the overnational business operators whose goods are designed to people of lower and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything throughout the world, from a pool through the lake weapons and a car battery to the wallet, the sheep and the milk.
Its sales products are 8% to 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
Thus, many employees with low sales in Walmart's sales purchases only at work.
The accessibility and sort of goods have affected one of the largest companies in America from Walmart.
According to critical words, Walmart may allow to sell goods so leaving partly because only a little pays his employees.
They also strive to a bad work of submines, such as the lack of automatic vehicles or hand scanners.
The demonstrators requested increased payments and tried to increase the costs for health insurance provided by the companies from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
The typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 per hour, but it does not correspond to the expenditure height, they say employees.
Scientists from the California in Berkeley conclude that if Walmart increases the average flight for $12 per hour, it will be $3,2 billion per year.
It is about 1,1% more than this company is charged for payments now.
If Walmart's company moves the increase of the woods to the traveller's branches, every visit in the sale will be only 46 cents more.
In the year, the clients will lose about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart's complainants show that the protest was only in nine countries and that the company should not make any damage practically.
"The Black Thursday" in the sales company was held from 8 hours evening on Thursday to north of the next day, and Walmart sold approximately 5000 items of goods per second during that period.
Its posts were completely performed in the Black Friday, almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company Dan Fogelman in a discussion on the left-by-handed website of Huffington Post that the work of the site was left by the whole "learer than five" of Walmart employees, and that the protest was all over the other media senses" that the Committees organized.
"It's not obsessed!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's business houses (they in this progress town are not too much in the village, so they are not here), but "McDonald" and other leaving restaurants.
McDonald says he sells a billion portions, and then he doesn't pay you a lot for your honest job!
Jumaane Williams, member of the city Council in New York
At the current time, the minimum payment for work in accordance with the federal laws and the provisions of New York State $7,25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this wheel, but just quietly, and in the middle of their range of work in New York, 8.90 dollars per hour.
There's no one in this dear town's lower wheat.
I don't understand enough how you can exist in New York for such money.
The employment at McDonald will pass at least a quarter of American teenagers who work after school for a shared account and live with their parents.
Just a few people look at their main source of life or plan to stay over there.
Today, I continue to meet with the McDonald work, who try to live out of these money and sometimes even feed your children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, he highlights a comment that the author notes that it is unresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests started at 6:30 on Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, requested that post- and kitchens in the suburbs of the EEC rubber begin to get at least 15 dollars per hour, which is more than twice of their current minimum wheels.
They also requested that the committee organisations be placed in the field of EEC.
American laws prohibit the administration of protecting the establishment of committee organizations and maintaining the activists of the committee's movement by shaking and release.
On the other hand, the administration is only sometimes to make life easier.
However, the introduction in the areas of the committee's compulsory organization is complicated from the objective parts.
One of the main debts is usually high fluctuation of employees.
Incompatible
In this day, there were a huge protests in many other leaving restaurants of Manhattan.
The exhibition of this action was at the south meeting at the "McDonalda" near Times Square, where several local democratic policies, especially the member of the town Council of Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billion portions, and then he doesn't pay you too for your honest work!"
Demonstrants also expected support for other prominent non-euro democrats, such as the candidate at the age of Bill de Blasio, who said, "We have to go together to support the work of fastfoods in order to achieve the right rewards for their work and economic prosperity, which every unarmed will deserve."
As the New York Times journal described, it was the biggest action of his species in the American Sfera of the EEC.
But it was only a few hundred people, even though not all of them were employees of a employment that worked in New York for tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will become an insurance that will enhance the flame of mass movement, it is still unexplained.
"It's still the brain's going to cry in the middle"
Among the fans of modern Â Â Â ̈a reality is an annual theme of an expanded reality; in the last time, it means ¶mat world, especially through the game of special brilliants.
At the beginning of the year to its annual year, Google was transferred to the Google work’s model of this news and in November it was announced that the request for the relevant patent also gave Microsoft.
From the conversation with the leader group of interactive 3D in Cambria’s company's workers of Microsoft Sharam Isadim, the company has already been white for this company.
The lake is the perspective manipulation of the rational objects in the air with the hole of hands, the creation of public spaces.
- Please tell us what's your research group involved?
We're looking for a man's interaction with the machine, but we're trying to move the border of this interaction.
Humanity has then reached a stage of work with pixels on the desktop, which sometimes touchs the screens with a ring.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox console and Kinect films - this is a step forward, and at least no Xbox today is on sale without Kinect videos, because it is very interesting for all to handle with gest.
- What else's waiting for us in the future?
- Despite Kinect's system has brought interactions to physical level, very many interactions still run on the desktop, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of the information has improved (with the acceptance of more powerful data), but the output flow has not yet been particularly.
We are trying to change this, we work on three-dimensional visualization systems based on different projectives.
You need to let the computer world go into our physical world, make it more real.
However, it is necessary to know not only those who are known, but also the area around.
Then we will be able to complete the real world of objects in a much more appropriate form.
And in the first row - shit with those stupid helms of reality!
- What do you think of voting control?
That's an anniversary thing, but doesn't he appreciate it?
- Of course, it can't be considered as all of us - it's a question of privacy because we don't want to finally inform our activities and purposes in our environment.
All types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own own.
For example, for the control of equipment in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not of divergence, but of such a short, short, so much.
The Gesta would not take a camera of equipment, but a flash that would follow the moves of the bones and the swallows.
He's still big, but the theoretics can reduce him to the size of the flame hours.
However, generally, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesto + voice.
- How do you do that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this limonate cup?
Tell it and show it at the same time.
- I'm just talking about.
- Oh, that's gonna be very complicated.
- So you want to take the trainer to adapt to what the machine can or can't?
- It's not needed, but it's a mutual closeness.
I think in the near future, we will need to work mainly on the development of new types of videos that can be more accurate to detect human reactions.
For example, this can be laser recorders that provide relatively good deep solutions, it is very important.
- If you have to talk about your job with Sensors Xbox Kinect, what are your requests for the modern camera?
Isn't there enough solutions, deepness, or anything else today?
- In fact, the present generation - this is what we can deal with in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels with 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapselies alone, but as a mother and a deep.
In the present view of the matter, all currently are inadequate for us - it assigns work to the designers of algorithms.
So we have to have a memory not just a solution in the X and Y axis but also Z.
So very important, it's also the equacy, the number of photos per second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flow of 30 photos per second are sincerely spoken a little, especially for gesta.
Stephen Betishes from our laborer in Redmond made a contact recorder with the final treatment of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, with its manufactured recorders are close to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how measured it affects human interactions with the machine.
For me in the work, it would be a very useful equivalent of such equipment, just not too much topics, but a photo in a second more.
- And the number of cameras isn't necessary?
- In Kinect's system, three "camera" are now used, one is in infrared sender and the other - the receipt of a reflected signal.
And the third camera is, in fact, a running recorder of the visible screen.
This shall not be used for the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or to hurt him because he would increase the needed volume of the calculated calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible kinect analogue system, to play with the locking location of the camera and to see how it will help to determine three-dimensional positions.
- I'm not taking a good time, Microsoft (of Google) did not pre-work publicly his brilliants.
Do you not think that as regards the daily use of an expanded reality using special brilliants, is one of the most promised platforms?
- Of course, walking and keeping a smartphone in the lifted hands is not too satisfied, but I think: the strongest variant would be the "free" image of the reality extension when it was possible on the basis of the clouds platform to switch anyway from the brain on the smartphone, the project display, and further around the dool.
Bryle - this is a very personal equipment, in which they have their strength (the special things you see only) and at the same time weakness - the expanded reality on the basis does not allow you to work on local objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine a moment that manipulation with simultaneous holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Starkovi in "Iron Man", but also to the running mortal.
There is one problem to which the critics often indicate: there is no touch response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this call?
In my predictions, I often say an expanded reality -- it's the seventh part of it's going on in the middle of interaction between man and machine.
I think the completion of hot wheels could be quietly the eighth middle.
One of the interesting tricks is also used - using the second hand as a species of the base for display.
That's a wonderful way that's referring to shopping!
But there are also -- which are actually focused on adding the materiality to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of some directional ultrasound papers in a defined point where the ring is located, calls a hot feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you'd fucked on the rings.
There is also a frame on the cup that affects the nervous throat in the rings - also a promised direction.
- You've already tried to screw the brain?
So he thinks he feels what it seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge to fight - how to admire a person who is physically located in a very tired space to believe that it runs openly, practically unnecessary space - we also work on the concept of running traces (inclusively not such as in clubs), which move platforms and large coals.
If the brain is a goal, the work is still a lot of years.
That's what works on local reality so attractive for researchers -- many things are in perfect starts.
Western in the place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the "Petrohradska avengarda" project, newed to the citizens who are in the head, are predgards of culture and art.
On the top of the list, there were already significant positions of Petrohrad scenes, whose expenditure exceeded the city, often refer to recognition in Europe without reaching the Irusian vote.
The new Rosbalt horse is a threatening Cyril Miller creator.
The whole town knows Cyrila Miller, a man who is all clothed in the red, which you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Air Garden, here in the modern hostels and on the verniss.
The pictures of Cyrila Miller, whereever they are built, are attached to the dairy of the wheels.
Cyril Miller is one of the pure social and philosophical philosophical reporters, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is the ideal man of Petrohrad avantgardy end 80 and the beginning of 90s.
Besides being a cityman, his evidence in the streets calls a smile on the faces of citizens, he increases all the trials.
Recently he took a flashinet into his hand and became a petrohrad flashnetter, because in this complicated role he had taken into his whole godly life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking through the town in the red, not in the yellow or for example in the Turkish?
- I chose a red color as a designer with the look and image.
In this world, it represents a red color of compromise between artists, imagemakers and publics.
Perhaps it generally applies that everything that is just a little different from the seed will be aggressive and develop bad properties.
But my operations are inclined to be discussed.
The whole story of my operational actions is in particular the invitation to discuss.
- And when did you realize you had to be a artist?
- In the New York Culture House, where my job was built.
I understand what's my way.
Then I couldn't understand the wolf of old free unufficial artists and new, free artists.
I was friend with the artists of the new wings, with the post-gazónians who brought us to Pushkinske 10, and there were no other wings.
It loves me to the division, clothes, music, all the genres other than the word.
- And all this happened in your art-clinic ...- For me, it was important to feel in the center of the culture of Petterburk, where all the best powers of creature should be kept.
In 1995, I occupied the place in Puskin 10, and there was a musical-artical club, a godly club, a home of Peterburk gods before reconstruction.
There were many: NO, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Snura brought up with the project "Ucho van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sing under a slightly light song, dressed themselves into low triangles, among them Igor Vdovin, who is now in the mode.
When the cup started playing alive, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has conducted many hali-Gali-Gali-time programs.
We gave them Trachtenberg, so he started his big career, basic education and professional preparation.
Galery "D 137", "Gribojedov" club, this is the art Clinic.
Here our workers and constant hosts have gone.
I'm a hero of the past centuries when culture was something else meaning.
In 2000, an investigation was organized in printing, the special price was "The people in our town."
I was called me in the name of the "Annual Artist", so I ended my top.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is inappropriate, I am a man of truth, honour and culture of the past century.
In the current years, it is easy to stand with an array, but culture and popularity are different today, you can be `arrival, but not too cultural.
- Your works are a characteristic way.
- Many of my images - these are the hits in which lives are captured by the currentity and procurability.
I'll have a Russian Museum in Klaunech.
Clauns are a overtime category.
Before I was a community, being such is painful and terrible today.
But in the clowns, it's all covered, it's playing a truck.
I love magic, I have great ideas.
For example, to save the world by the way of totality restructuring in the ship.
Today people are meetings according to clothing, oriented on the external mechanism, not on the inner person.
Or maybe he can't give him his hand, and he's supposed to go into his face.
And the cloud will be removed by overlapping.
- We've seen you recently in the town's flashing. - The Cultural town should have such a herd.
And who should be, if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- It should be a commercial, useful artistic, tactful, sweet.
It's coming to the spread of culture.
Earlier, people were assembled in the foolish, and they loved one, one simple people.
Today, everything has been disappointed on microscoolity, it's very hard to enjoy all.
I'm not a stone bankroom to like everyone.
Today, you need to think about who you like.
Today every cultural herd has 100 fans.
- And on Stass Michael's coming a couple of thousands of birds!
- The fans will come on him, there's a sexy social sfer.
And there will be 300 people on cultural ground and 10 thousand will not come to them, and the investigation is less management, money, everything is great.
I've got fans, the main is that nobody's opened and doesn't break what's cool.
When I was young, I drawed the pictures that weared on the wall together with Falke and Larionov at one collector.
I started with pictures that people end.
Today, we'll get people often to understand.
They say:Culture of spirit, culture of consumption.
There is no needed culture, it's anywhere.
I am a man of culture last day, I grew up in examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing images.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Peterburk?
- Good professionals in culture.
There is such a concept: a factor through culture.
Not everyone of them, but it can be a culture.
For a number of kings, it wasn't so in all, the kings may not understanding the culture, but they realized that it was necessary to support professionals.
In Moscow, there are good constants today.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they are a deal somewhere in the cup because they are needed by major experts who are rightly evaluating these professionals and leading them on the right way.
Today, it's going to promote a cousin.
So Erart, but it's different that they sincerely say that we accept not all modern arts, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petterburk?
- Petterburk - it's not the main city of culture, there's a much more culture in Moscow, there's the right ground.
And on our top, the art gets worried.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers than readers today, that's wrong.
In Europe there are very many people who are vicious who go to exhibitions.
It's just weak at us.
We need the art to become a modest matter, as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project is implemented for the grant of St.Peterburk
Rotate in the universe
The earth's in danger.
Global bleeding or colise with a murderous asteroid.
Kosmical ships with grounds on the ground are shown on the road, search for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question is: How can we maintain our fruitage in disasters or on a given replacement plane?
I think the choice is no big.
There are only two planets that are possible to win, even if only hypothetics.
"It's Venusha and Mars," says the high-deep worker of the State Astronomic Institute P. K. Sternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better submines for life at Mars, at the surface of Venus, the temperatures of 500 degrees of Celsia are reached.
Life is possible only in a big height or in the Venezuela orbit... in the universe.
To resolve the issues of reproduction in the universe, people started with a floor.
A half centuries ago, plant trials were performed.
Four generations of games played on the current road are nothing different from their earthquake family.
Thereafter, there was an outcome of smoke on the orbit - very small fruity men of Drosoela.
In 1979, a crop sheep was sent to the universe, and they checked their development in an insufficiency.
We get a absolute normal bird on the output.
But then the problems begin.
"It's a problem that this bird must find a resistance, must be placed on his own feet and start moving," says the leader of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
They don't find a resistance, the chaotic birds fall and make the cocktails.
After 10 hours, there came to be a total instinct cluster in the holidays of the birds.
The birds did not respond to the light or sound.
And the time was that they were just lost in four days.
"Two times we let the birds go out, but then we refused it, because it is simply impossible to work with them," comments the failure of the experiment with the birds in the universe of Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarch" animals were flying on both roads 16 years ago.
In 2013, experiments will continue.
In the "Bion" biosatelity, but they'll be only the future of one generation.
He's been experienced with the visitors who were sending to the universe already pregnant.
In fact, they didn't discover anything overborn there.
"It was just on biosatelites, but again - it's a single experiment and such trials must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the earth’s arrival with the cosmical villages, the seed was born.
However, it hasn't yet been possible to draw close to the problem of multiplying directly in the universe.
It's a hard job.
Life in the loss of life rubber can only be able to carry out their instinct.
A man, in the case of animals, can in principle.
Homo'ens governs abstract thoughts and is able to create a relevant emotional background.
It does not prove similar experiments from ethics.
But women fly to the universe for 50 years.
The biggest danger of Téréschov's threat.
The most precious thing that humankind has is the female body.
Our Chuck was flying and nobody could say if he would keep years in the universe.
Can he be able to be born a child after that year?
"Behold, no one has yet answered this question," says the veteran of the Vachtang Va日 sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after the universe, the first woman-cosmonautka of Valentina Türesha's daughter was born.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut Andrian Nikolajev.
In 1988, the son of the second cosmonaut of the World Savica, who visited the orbit two times and worked in the open universe.
However, the risk remains.
We have just a few cosmonauts who have been born after long years and growing health of the seed.
"In addition, it may be dangerous in orbital years," says Cosmonaut-pilot, the Hrdina of the Soviet Union and the Hrdina Russian Valerie Poljakov.
Humanity must, however, unexpectedly look for new paths in biological, radiation protection and creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is a obligation stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in points with zero attractiveness, cosmons are gaining the advantages necessary for work in the open universe.
The water follows the state of unfortunateness.
Perhaps water for adults is a comfortable, but in my way strange, for children, it is a natural animal.
Small Impathyanders seem to be confirmed that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a relationship between that the child is located in the mother’s fruitwater in a average of 9 months and then it is easier for them to reach water.
In principle, it's logical, because from the time of birth, from the time of the first relief, it's only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget the child something," says the instructor of Marina Aksenov's newborn.
Strangely said - if the status of a newborn child is more naturally, then for women it is more natural inexcusable gravity, an attractive force.
In the lack of difficulty, it is very difficult to rub off the wounds, the master's swallows, the body's ability to throw out the fruit.
This can be left by the side if the stimulators of the swimming activity at birth.
The end of the end is possible to be born in a special room in which the mother's body is going out of fruit.
"And what else?" claimed Valerie Poljakov complicated questions.
On the other hand, the child also has a artificial gravity.
It is not able to form the coast or the system of weapons properly to the organisms to affect the earthly attractiveness.
The newsground on the current road is not possible to be dressed as a adult in a special clothes, and it can be trained.
It's just going to be saved from what to his development without a memory.
"When we go with you to a experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign 日, we bring a healthyly achieved person on the earth, which will be completely unproportionated to the current age," predicts the IBMP RAN Igor Pests Bioetics Committee.
So the divorce of children in the universe is just a theoretical question today.
Once, however, the time of reality will come and when the earthquake will be issued in their ships on a remote planet, which will become home to their descendants of the universe.
Boss of the NKU: Control of Svarcs
Czechland has good control and quality legislation in relation to public prohibitions, but it involves it.
In the discussion for Currently.ch says that Vice-President of the Supreme Control Authority of Miloslav Kala.
"The Law will never be perfect, but it must be the right of his own - that is what we miss according to my opinion," comments Kala.
Similar conclusions also indicate the common control of the Czech and German controllers.
As an example of wrong practice, Petra often provides access to the "swarcs" called "swarcs".
Recently, Mr Prime Minister said that the ODS would comply with its controls - is it, then, prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be overcome, and if something is prohibited, either the President of the Government cannot prevent the operation of the office which has the obligation to go to control and deal with responsibility," Cala states.
At the meeting of the Czech and German Control Committee, you have recently spoken of a joint project between the Czech and the German party, which has been compared with a legislation on public prohibition in both countries.
What did it mean?
It's about the parallel control we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that the European legislation is adjusting the way to solve public prohibitions, followed by individual national legislation and then on the same basis.
We have given all this income, and although the control has not yet been completed, we have shown very interesting differences - the general legislation, which is said, is possible to be more precise and more perfect, but the practice is in some parameters better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not possible to create more precise rules, but it is necessary to carry out the rights themselves.
What, in fact, can this project help you, what it takes for you?
Just such a common control could contribute to it, and they stopped to determine efforts to clarify, reduce and complete limits, if it does not have such a impact.
Hospitality means to obtain the appropriate thing for a reasonable price (which but does not mean the lowest) in order to distort distortion and, where appropriate, criminal acts.
But by decreasing the limit of the prohibition, we don't have to achieve it necessarily.
Maybe this system will be paid to such a "paper" quantity that those in this system wanting to look for streams, so they will have much more easier than if the limit remains higher.
You are talking about foreign problems with the translation of legislation on public prohibition to practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office like our NGOs here, or is it designed differently?
As regards the offices, as the NKU works there, Bundesshof, which is organized as we, is also a college, just being created in a little different way, but in principle both officials are practical.
The powers are also concerned in certain ways, but Germany has social arrangements, thus these annual courts and at the level of individual countries - in this system is different from our little.
BRH can only control the social money, represented by the state of us.
The public centres governed by countries and foreigns are controlled there from the level of social courts.
What's more legislative about this, so it's easier than our?
Normally, I would not like to compare this without specific data, however, in some ways Germany was marked as a pattern, but it cannot be sure that it is better in everything.
So, is that even having a better control?
I'm sure that's not, but I'm saying again, I don't have such comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries we consider as a pattern are faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any benefit to cooperate with our office, right?
What about foreign legislation, which is the new law of public law for your office, has already been shown by its impact?
Since the period of validity of this newsleague is relatively short, we still do not have controls yet.
Because we're doing ex post controls, it's necessary to calculate some later.
We also watch it only in the future control process - we started our new tool "detecting risks of inhumanity" through which we have put at least 14 thousand public prohibitions, and we analyze them - these changes will be clearly shown, because the limits, some types of election process are adjusted and similar.
So, do you think that the approval of this law is more like advantage, or the further deterioration of the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can happen here is that she's rules "right" and where it's possible to keep them.
For the purposes of the previous rules, the controlled persons are committed by the provider (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any lack of law on public prohibitions means a deterioration of the budget.
So the price of the law is to make this clear?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and use it, not to treat those who are allowing formal doubts that have no impact on decision.
Such a system will only create a higher pressure on birocracy.
So how did you get out of that?
Let's show us where the way doesn't know.
Recently, Mr Prime Minister said that the ODS's employee would force the control of this "swarcs" - and what does that mean?
Svarcs’em is prohibited or enabled?
The law must be aligned, and if something is prohibited, either the President of the Government cannot prohibit the operation of the authority which has the obligation to go to control and deal with obligations.
They can say, "We change the law and let it go," but we can't say we're going to do as nothing.
In the law on public prohibitions, the rules are relatively close to what formally is to be implemented - which is right to protect public concurrence.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic when the best offer interesters are excluded only for formal failure.
The Law will never be perfect, but it must be the right thing he has - that's what we miss, according to my opinion.
The roads are places deep, but combined
There are some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are deceased and also snippets.
Most of them, but the drivings are covered, somewhere with increased care.
Carlovarian country
Today, in the Carlovar country, the roads were combined, but the places were broken and deceased.
The temperature has fallen between five and ten degrees under zero, but in the day it must be quietly heated.
The destruction in the region has been established and there is only a weak layer in the lower.
However, on the Cross Mountains, there is about 30 meters of snow.
Locations were even less visible for milk, which resulted from the data available for national travellers.
The fast road R6 and the first class communication are now in the region without restriction.
However, caution is at the place, for example, on some overflows, where the surface can be broken and crazy.
All other and third-party roads are also coincidenced in the mountain roads.
But in some areas there are still the rest of the wound and the places of the snow.
Moreover, in the higher positions, we need to increase the attention of the driving.
Pardubian and Royal Great Country
On some streets in East Czech, it is dangerous for us, in higher positions and in the mountains it can take a snow level on the communications, informs on its sides the Road Management and the streets.
Carriers warn the drivers before wearing, can be created, in particular, in the higher positions of the Pardubian country.
Consequences may be in the area of Lanschkroun, the Boss of Orlicia, Policy, Svitav or High Myth, especially in the roads of other and third classes.
Chemicals are treated by I/43 and I/34 in Svitav.
The snow is especially on the streets in the Mountains of the Church and Orlical Mountains.
The captured snow layer is in the highest positions of the streets during the periods of Rychnov over the Prince and Trutnov.
In Eastern Czech, the most often today is to be able to be stuck.
The temperatures are moved around between minus three and plus one degree Celsia, a fucking weak wind.
Country of the Plzneiland
Roads in the Plzneiland are currently combined, but places with increased care and driving must be adapted to time.
This is a degree of fraud, the temperatures are moved between three and nine degrees under the middle point.
Some communications may be nice after eating and afterwards.
Locations must also calculate with milk, but the visibility will be improved gradually.
This results from information from the disability of national travellers.
The D5 range is nearly unlimited, but the communication manager recommends that it be more careful than 80 to 131 km.
Most of the roads of the first class have the surface sucked and exhausted.
On the southern Plzensk and Tahowsk, but they can be cut off.
Communications of the second and third classes are low, and in this case also applies warning on a slightly degree.
The drivers should be careful primarily on less frequency travels in Shumava.
Olomouc country
With the snow boxes on the street, the drivers today have to go to the highest position of the Olomouck country.
She stayed on the Red Horse Site and on the road toward Videlski Cross.
The travelers to the teren went out in the night of the darkness, and to Shumper, according to the road managers, were deceived of three centimeters.
In the remaining parts of the country, carriers are unlimited.
"The rest of snow is in the highest positions of Snow.
With the snow chass on the Red Horse seat, the drivers have to count in the direction of Jesenic," said the CTK department of the Sumper Road Management today.
In the territory of the night, their colleagues at Jessenic, the ways to the highest positions are now following them after chemical treatment of collars and mockers.
On Olomo ́ku are streets without restriction, but the drivers to Sternberska should take care of in forests where the carriers remained heavy.
East country, Liberian country
Soon a few hard places are reporting today by a traveler northern Czech.
Furthermore, some places with an attacked snow or with a liver are closed by the mountain road from Telnice to the Usteck Kninice, which comes from the police database.
The temperatures are also maintained under zero positions, so ice and snow are obviously holding on the streets.In the lowers, especially south-east of the Czech Mediterranean, however, no problem is, and the streets are really sucked.
Transport complications are not yet reported.
The presentation of the iron reports to the traveller, especially from the area of Sweta.
According to the horologists for her, there were ideal subminans in the night - over the day of rain and deceasing, in the night and in the wheat.
From the main ships are reported on the street I/13 on the border of the Ustech and Liberean country.
The closure from Telnice to the Book has caused the moved trees that were burned under the snow’s snow to the carrier.
Simon Ornest: On concerts, we want to fix energy positions
What do you think he's gonna get the end of the world in a month?
It's just one of the other famous news that we're taking.
With the Tap Tap Cape, we do more pleasure and we say we're the only pipe in the world that can save enough energy positions, and -- the end of the world's wearing or protecting it.
In addition, you arrange a totally unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present it to readers closer?
It's a national benefit action we've planned for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar reported on 21st at 11:10 last.
The day before 20 hours of 21 hours, 3 concerts of success in Prague, Brna and Ostrava are simultaneously.
They will be completed in the time when the May calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is at the time travel about 12 hours before us.
Who came with this idea?
Well, it was like that my idea, then we've thought everything together with our manufacturer Honzo Augusto.
Besides that we want to raise enough energy positions and protect the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the condition of this world once to our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we also created a unique collection of objects of boot, trick, bottles or original keys against the end of the world, whose buying on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group, together with other interpretations, also encouraged such a hymn against the end of the world, named "The end of the world has been canceled".
He's already very favorite to YouTube today, will he also call on these beneficial concerts?
Of course, it's in the full conclusion, so if everything happens to us and the end of the world will not come...
It will encourage all the interpreters on all three concerts simultaneously.
Hymnes are also proposed once in a unique direct transfer to the Czech TV.
The word to this song wrote and the main role of Jesus in the clip plays Tomás Hanak, also sing in Xindl X...
How did you work with them?
We also cooperate with other characteristics of the Czech Cultural Scena, since we have a lot of benefits and concerts...
We are trying to engage them intensely in these projects.
It was shown that most of them are interested in and enjoying our cooperation.
What's going on with the outcome of concerts against the end of the world?
For the building of a non-barrier educational centre of Studeo, we have been conducting with the civil Tap association in the Yedlic Institute for six years.
For Jedlik's school students, the doctors are regularly involved in the activities they enjoy and care.
Only students have no abilities to give their own lectors, so we're trying to enable them this in this way.
In the performance of the Jedilic establishment in the future, the single buildings that we will move with this project will be made.
There are several music groups and interpreters on each concert.
Why did you choose them?
We tried to set up a program that will celebrate all generations of children.
For example, in Prague, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Searchy.
For more details, see www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning similar "bombistic actions" and in the future?
In May, we'll start first on the Prague Jar, so we'll certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting hosts.
In the next year, they also played in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, I would like to join it with the outcome in Washington and Chicago.
Your job plans are not minimalistic, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group that creates endicate people.
How are you doing these ways logistics and organizational?
It's not so terrible as the first look looks like.
We have five members on the electric vehicle, her vehicles have to travel in the locked room, we are obviously putting up a large amount of costs and beden with a tool...
However, it has happened without problems, the CHSA and British Airways were very ready for us that I had ever wondered.
Even in Moscow, from which we've been back recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to the outputs to the cartridge, you can compare the individual differences in freedom, the access of publicity to the hendikeped and similar.
What have you met yet?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we were just witnesses in Russia that everything is still at the east.
In contrast of Praza, Moscow is very barier, here is still unusual to move a man on the electric vehicle himself in the centre of the city.
It doesn't apply to such self-sociousness as you may give the vehicles a priority in the exhaust.
Happily, there are citizens who are trying to warn the problems of people.
And what, however, must we still have to do with the developing country?
It's about things we're still behind...
It is, however, important to mention that perfection and improvement are dependent on the efforts of people to do so.
In London and in Madrid, it is fully running that people with hard Hendikepe can move themselves to the public, go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever...
But it's not very common that a large number of people there would be an active social life, in contrast, we're with the Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respecting publicity or freedom is one thing, but just to the moment when we will be important sporters, artists, herds, politicians or lawyers, so things will start to change really.
Still, these are the only cases of people who have strong reasons.
The Tap Tap is currently very aware, but let's go back for a few years from the fact that you have been allowed to install it in 1998?
I came as a teacher in the Jedlik's statute, where I had a lot of young people around me who had to interest in something.
And since I'm a musician alone, I'm playing outside the saxophone, so I and the college put a interesting music circle together.
Well, in the course of our time, as our modernist Lady Angelovich says, it was a little lost from the hand (laughs).
But the popularity came to the last years, or I'm wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started associating with famous songs and also actively working on the propagation of the cups.
We realized that work that doesn't see, in fact, as if it doesn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to the contributions of the European Union, we can allow quality lectors, equipment and so further.
Was your goal to reach it with the Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something else.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one imitates the other.
It's in his way logical, all news are taken carefully and it takes it.
The knowledge that is unique is very small, but I'm trying to say that Tap Tap are one of them.
By the idea of a man who sees us first, it's of course sorry, it's natural...
But this feeling is absolutely irrelevant, because people with Hendikepe are not suffering from all the things we have to suffer.
There are people who can live a full-valuable life and develop, of course, because they have the need for it.
I'm saying, if something happens to people with the Hendikepe, it's not just a move for them, but for the whole company.
Has helped this success too that you are a tired boss, how many people mentioned you?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncomfortable in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think it's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic representation and a head in clouds, and when they find that they have to go two times a week to test, to interfere with the product and to take a lot of time on the roads on the concerts, it's the surprise and leave.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group who wants to work and who wants to reach something.
The Tap Tap has now twenty members.
How many of them were at its beginning in 1998?
Only the only Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people get away and come, they're not able to protect it.
Whoever has a guy and silence, has the door opened to us
Consequent day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
Goes in Praza Incheba Arena, Brne Fléda and Islands Plynée for 12 capsules and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three towns, at the end of the evening, are offered by telemos at the joint song of the chapel The Tap Tap "The end of the world has been canceled"
The objective of the concert is to construct the finance of the multilingual non-barrier educational centre of STUDEO at the One-United Institute in Praza in 25 million Kč
Incoming to concert is 400 Kč, children to 12 years have access free income in the pre-selling Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
In the last week, the European Space Agency was adopted by the European Ministers of the European Coast Agency for the twentyth member of this European Space Agency as the second country of the former East Blocks (after the Czech Republic of 12 November 2008) at the meeting of the European Space Agency.
Polish has started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and has participated in a number of projects of the Agency in the past years.
But the way of Poland to the world has started many years ago.
For the flights in the world, the Poland guardians had already passed before the Second World War; but they had not met the understanding.
For example, I recall A. Sternfeld's suggestion in Varsovia's astronomical observator, who represented ideas from his big work Income to cosmonique.
The thoughts of the young engineer (No. 1905) left the listeners of cold and after the years of Sternfeld insisted that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld obtained the Price of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great propagator of astronomy and cosmonic.
In the Poland magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books made by these disciplines.
Gadomski became a worldwide propagator and his contribution was also evaluated by the name of one of the corners on the back side of the month.
In 1925, a rail tree was built in Poland, which was to be watched by a racket engine.
Unfortunately, the author is not known and they are not known or the details of the project.
It does not even have to use the cancer for the dilution of the drizzle or for the confusion of it.
The information about this box is known only from the periodic print.
Since 1933, the cancer shooters started to collect the Polish School.
The Wikipedia ensured the Technic Cell of Army in collaboration with Professor Michislaw Wolfke and Professor Gustav Mokrickiegim.
From the materials concerned, it is evident that the research has reached the practical test stage.
The investigation was cancelled by the coming of German armies.
In 1937, in a professional print, the photo-electric sticking rackets proposed by the engineer Rohoziński and the next year the work of Raket - torpeda poõna and racket bomb of the Leliwy-Krzywoblock aircraft.
Both projects were designed for military use of racket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of military use of the racket technology were conducted by the Temporary Advisory Committee, which coordinated all works.
The election was based in 1937, but after two-year activity, his activity ended the start of war.
Other work-based cosmons are discovered by the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polski Astronautic Society).
First, it is a change to the company in the November issue of the 1954 magazine of the Problem, in which four more general articles are astronomy.
One of them, from Professor Subotoviče, has been proposed to create a company that will be interested in cosmon·s.
At that time, projects of artificial partners have already been spread and it was expected that space research is a perspective work.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) tried to enter the International Astronautic Federation (based on 1951) and has already become a regular member of the PTA.
And in the next year, the first president of PTA Kazi Méditer Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became the president of the International Astronautic Federation.
This was standing until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has contributed significantly to the development of very successful RM-orological rackets (Rakieta Meteorologica), which became the first Poland racket conducted by the research.
The type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and at the first start of 10 October 1958.
The racket with access of 1800 metres was a length of about 80 cm and its weight was not limited to 5 kg.
In 1959, a perfect version of RM-1A was established, and in the Bledow wilderness, a two-party RM-2 air test was started.
The racket was 1,4 meter long and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
Another type of development should have been already able to work - RM-34 cancer should have access to 14,5 km, and its task was to follow high-speed.
In fact, in 1962, further development was stopped.
The leader of the first RM rackets became the Meteor-1 cancer developed in 1962 to 1965.
The racket was designed as a double-graduate, its total length was 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different from the size of the space for deck devices.
The Meteor-1A cancer was available with a range of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B with 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with 0.62 litres.
The maximum access to all three types was 37 km.
During 1965 and 1968, he was developing the Meteor-2 racket in the League Institute, whose first year tests began in October 1970.
The meteor-2 racket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to produce an beneficial weight of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The following versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were set.
It is still necessary to mention the income of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the CoSPAR National Committee for two years ago.
In the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in the research of the Space Space in Soviet artists, and in 1978 the Poland pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became a second intercosmonau.
The abrogation of the law on public duties is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court of Justice was rejected.
The resolution was called for a living debate to the public.
In fact, it will be interesting in looking at the issue of a widespread view.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU are based on the principle of more, non-regulated economic competition in the globalized world.
In its effect, it means that individual economic creation, national economic systems, stands in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The reason is the principle of free trade and freedom, no limited movement of the privacy, together with an inevitable financial speculation.
The impact of significant shares in the price of the work (mezd) is to be a price-effect.
In this regard, it is necessary to understand the situation when the manufacturer is trying to remain in the economic competition by "underwarding" the price of the competitor with a view to enhanced market share in itself and increasing its own profits.
In the massive measure, it means to translate the production into the foreign or to buy, or avoid.The result is high unemployment in countries where the prices of work are compared to other high economics.
Since the privacy has no Community responsibility and also the responsibility for its produced unemployment, it is necessary to increase the social expenditure of the State.
In addition, it encourages the total demand of employees to pay taxes and to replace economic and social damage that he has in the motion of winning.
The situation is so generally known that specific statistical data should not be indicated.
With regard to privacy practices, individual economic practices are established when the governments of individual countries are required to enter into a mutual competition with the aim of reducing the social level of their own population in order to join the country of foreigners.
Otherwise, governments give to the privacy of all their own populations without regard to social disaster.
This is particularly shown in the changes of applicable laws.
The objective is to encourage the own population to accept a price dictate of private assets, in particular in the middle.
However, this is a system of economic donation in the case of unemployment, but the restriction of the rights of employees in the work rights is limited.
The result is a growing poverty together with the growth of divisions between poor and rich.
The SRN has already been a number of years of public food benefits for poor people who cannot use their own work.
The beginning of these people is already going to millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, the fact that the right employee is enough to pay them to a minimum of existence.
Such scandal was also published in the case of assisted employees of social snow.
Increasing measures for the practice of all Southern EU countries are absolutely leading to the same condition when people under the pressure of a disaster level of social disaster are needed or to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live for cold railways in the area of the company, in fact, that a private investment area may be brought to the country once.
Here you need to ask, but where's he coming?
If this is from other EU countries, poverty moves from one country to another, or will not come too, because China, India, Brazilian, or Turkish, Marokkanic, or Egyptian, or African still works for a breach of European forests.
That's about the whole Latin America.
Liberal theory and media claim that the state cannot be able to reach its own economy that the management of the economies leads to economic disaster.
The privacy's position remains increasingly on the state's determination that the principles should not be governed by the State.
Then it is necessary to ask whether the privacy does not affect it, that is, it is, in fact, politics and the whole state in its own egoist sense.
Here's a unique answer, yes.
The evidence of the existence of practices is universal and all present lobbys in all States.
The consequence is a disfellowshipping of corruption, providing mutual benefits, laws, where practices are all criminal, but nothing penalty.
In the SRN, the State Ministerial for Financial Insufficiencies provides the process of laws to private legal firms that are devastated in connection with the future.
These laws are then revoked in Bundestag.
All such power does not come from people as the institutions of the western type, but of the financially strong groups of prefering their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberally oriented democracy is now reached to the description of Appiános in its part of the Roman Republic's Crise in the days of Caesar and Pompeia: "State was already in full division and the authorities were conceived by violence.
For taxes, illegally obtained in order and using stones or swords.
Subcomplaints and corruptions were made without any detention, and people walked to elections with the previous sale voice "..."..."Caracter people did not keep on the authority, so once he was in the result of this divorce was a state of eight months without conquises."..."The only medicine in destruction was self-government and that it was necessary to choose a man of energy."Apiános thought about Pompeia, but it became Caesar, who changed the duration of democracy to self-control.
Closure Like in the past, the current company is based on independent preferences of its own benefit without regard to the global interest.
The privacy has no longer been able to understand and apply global benefits from its grounds.
The investigation is now, as at the time, an inappropriate decade to flee without any effort to reform the deepest.
Therefore, we must seek the course of fascist and communistic regimes in the undeserved liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.
As the current state, the decline of these systems can be considered to be a certain stop with the expectation of another road in the progress of the liberal democracy.
In particular, the catastrophe is that the current elite is totally ignoring in the future the potential statistical losses of life, humanitarian and social disasters that we are now witnesses together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new populations.
The abrogation of the law on public duties is not a solution, at least not a permanent.
Under the pressure of economic competition and international and intra-European competition, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek the way to continue to reduce the social level of population.
So this trend is systematic.
The solution is the objective of political and social reforms that strengthen the public's economies, enhance the impact of citizens on government and weaken the monopolal position of privacy in the company in the benefits of the State.

I don't want to think of who is the killing of vineyards in periodic times and who are victims, the people of Israel today, in general, were born into the current political and the beginning of violence.
This is what I have to offer to readers the view of opon, the view of whom it has served in particular 95 years of sustainable pressure (recommended by Balfourovacation in November 1917) on the small coast of the Mediterranean country.
Some of my views are supported by the available historical facts some of them are carried out based on my own understanding of who the group of people is the main hybater of modern history.
Humanity's activities are in the first range of power.
In each epoch, we can look at Alexandra the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether it was those persons who did their steps completely autonomously and or did someone stand behind their throne who directed their actions to the above-determined goal.
We must admit that we live at the time when the world's riches are concentrated in the hand of some individuals, and that the money concentration and the exhausting powers of one generation could not be achieved.
Among these astronomic wealthy families, one that could be considered as a head of a hobby (if anyone still stands over them, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschields.
It's not much about them.
It's understanding.
The pressing agency (Re日s) already buyed in the 1990s of the 19th century to stop their name with the high crime effects in which they were standing behind and which were meaning for them to comply with power, richness, or both.
They have major shares in at least all central banks of the world and against countries where they shared in Central Area are not conducted or prepared for wars (for the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq's attack it was 5 countries, only four, but Russia was subjected to the Central Bank of the Russian Government).
Everyone who tried to take this family was dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank of Rothschield Bank of America, began to deliver their own (intelligent government) money and was killed in 1865 in the divadle.
JFK began to deliver his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, killed in 1963, Mr. Louis McFadden was killed in 1936 after he wanted to blame the FED for the discovery of a great economic crisis in 1929.
Their desires after global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate the plan of three world wars by the highest builder, 33th degree of dedication to Albert Pike.
The war had to remove large monarchists in Europe, the second had to remove the colonial government, especially the Great Britain, and the third, to reduce the world population somewhere to 0.5-1 billion people (that is the number of children for their convictions and Luxus enough and unnecessary resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than the precondition for such solutions) and the final overcome of the absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest family in the face of Rothschielda works is to call the crisis and the next solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are false and lead to deterioration (see FED layout to not repeat the crisis as they called in 1907).
So after the murder of the R-U Throne of Ferdinand in Sarai's first world war, the Russian Russian had destroyed by launching the Bolshev Revolution.
The World War ended with an offense, military and economically unrespective, Germany's Culture (which was not needed for the destruction of the Caribbean Russian) and then reached the development of the Central European Power, Rakouska Uherska.
For the easier dissolving of the Second World War, the political banks have allowed to create a late conflict by providing to Germany major war reparations, which have created a predict for radicalization of the winners and then have only been sufficient to support Germans sufficiently strong, vineyards indicating and simple solutions of the leader's offering and further creating the multinationality of the Czech Republic with a strong German minority, which had been very much, and they have also sought to support the Germans, the fifth colons, in a favor of the military fire.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschield's arrest of Zion's stick movement, whose one work tried to create a Jewish state, preferably in the history of Judah and Jerusalem, the coby capital city (return to Zion).
The Balfour'ace already established a precondition for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestinian, began to engage in the first places with the local Arabian population.
The terrorist attacks have been affected by both sides.
The second world war was struck by Hitler from the road on which the international bankiers first held him, or everything that he had been in the plan was hard to consider, every suffering of European Jews in concentrations created a provision for the acceptance of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially based in 1948 and, as warfare of Germany was made on the Second World War, the announcement of the State of Israel was created by the fire of the Third War.
When the international bankers are able to distort it, a Jewish nation, like in the second, will be victims in the first line of wars, now together with the Arabic or general Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is as a great laborer, a source of harvest and chaos, not only in the area of the land, but also in the international measure (that is just how people are divided into the prosecutors and Israel’s rebellion).
Who is the vineyard and who is the victim of the Palestinian - Israelian conflict, where the wrath produces a crime in an unnecessary road, when at the beginning of all, the chamtifulness of individuals and their desires by global power?
Here is a need to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we are, international banks support people for choices in their elections exclusively own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyah, is a typical example of fashioning, to international loyal bankers, a policy that is doing everything to spread the war with Iran, which would, in view of the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Group for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten the cross in global conflict and the control of Iran over the Hormuzal Proliferation, which travels 20% of all the world ropes (the flood corridor is only 2 miles width) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In which light the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994, "Only we are the general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world rule in their presence is the world of gentlemen and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves will conceal financial aristocracy.
The world where every newly born unit is implanted in the birth of chip, which results from a completely controlled life.
"And he makes all the small and big, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have on the right hand or on the head of the heart, so that he can't buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the beast or number of its name.
That's what you need to understand: who has a sense to read the numbers of the beast.
This number indicates a man and it's a number of sixty-six."
Film Argo: When it's worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he concealed a deal of demonstrating islamic students in the American ambassador in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as a manuscript.
They had to be allowed to be a exchange for the composed Mohamed Rezu of Pahlavi, who after revolution, went to the United States, who were a patron of his regime after a few decades.
For the US administrative, the ship has not offered a position on the east - to run a shot through the rubber it could not be allowed because it would have so mainly threatened confidence in associates in other countries.
The release of the hands in Iran, where the revolution was developed in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not able to reach.
It was the ability for the prestigiation of the United States, which has yet been pronounced by the trial of freedom of hands with power.
The diplomatic prisons were finally released after 444 days, after negotiation of the Algerian government.
Their share in the house has called a wall of solidarity and an anti-irranic feeling.
Debakl in Iran has expressly contributed to Jimmy Carter's breakdown with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film of Ben Affleck Argo is described as an episode of the story that America has brought great victories.
Soon before the ambassador was taken out of her six employees.
After the complicated peripheres, they ended in the residence of Canadian wildlife.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, it helped them from Iran, helping extravagant crises of historical history - they went to Canadian passes as members of the filmship, watching the locations of the country for the shi-fi major film.
Genre combination
The plan that was designed for Tony Mendez's "exfiltration" expert, also requested Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to be legal, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, printing, ficticial production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been emphasised for a time, the film comes out of the Tony Mendez.
Afflec's film is a special combination of more genres.
On one side of the realisticly captured political thriller, e.g. "caper movie", the story of an exhibition, a submission - a example may be the Danny's series of partners.
In the movie, it is the case of the film - on the one hand of the documentary sequences taken from Teheran (in the title sequence, the iconic times photographs are shown by events and the same ways were contained in the movie - great differences in it are not).
On the other hand, a passport from Hollywood, negotiated with ironic and mild surface.
And then scenes from the center and other institutions - men in the clouds breaking up the chairs, on the boards, on the boards, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had a careful way to restart the career.
From the mixed herce, he became a respected register and his heritage stopped to be a worst ironic note.
Argo is his third night film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and Thriller City (2010).
It's the first Afflec's photo that doesn't play in the restaurant of Boston.
At the same time, the citizen for the atmosphere was among the characteristics of the elderly films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows him in Argo, where Teheran "speaks" Canada.
The best scenes in the movie are played in the streets, when rebuilding events - the introductory sequence of the fall of ambassadors is active in its overviews, which, rather than the emotions of money and invisibleness, which occurs when somewhere clearly moves the rubber.
Similarly, Affleck and his collaboration are reached in the scenes of thoughts (false chamber on the Teheran Basar).
Too many places in too many
The register had to arrange with that the reported story does not actually offer power in the meaning of the movie scenes.
It works very well with that almost, sometimes it makes something to reality - there is no longer so elegant (scale in which the threatening crisis on the Teheran Airport returns the phones in America and the phones after the ransom works enough to have hair).
The weak Arga, however, is the dilution that results from the need to show too many places in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in Hollywood's co-operation, even though their positions would have served more space and they weren't remotely in this movie.
The Afflec's movie is so little loss of dramatic rate, it is a picture that is possible to follow with a mild interest, assess the performance and retro*l evoking thrilling 70s.
But it's just hard.
Like one way of living story and evidence of how the ideas of the universal and comprehensive secret services are overcome, but it is enough.
Rules for balloons, bananas and circles
Server www.banknipoplatky.com, which reports each year the most absurd bank and payment, has now decided to report the concurrence of "the more absurd regulation or ideas from the EU part".
"He brought us to the last event when the EU plans to adopt 40% of the quota for women in the leading of big European fires," said the Right Organizator of Patrik Nader.
For example, there is a recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the combination of the rates for men and women.
In this case, women in the prices of livelihood have been advantaged because they are objektively less risks for security.
"The next unbelievable ideas from the EU are possible to mention to the end of the year.
Only voting will then run until the end of February 2013," Nader informed.
The EU-controversial Regulation also includes the obligation of placing biocombustible materials into powder, which results of damage of nature, further prohibiting the use of adequate plant temperatures only because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances, or the Directive on the size of blind claims, for which she has expounded for years.
Criticals previously claimed a real prohibition of use of the expression of the sale mass or the classification of classical sales.
Quality bananas have 14 metres
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of such or such trade or industrial lobbys, which generally require some states or groups of States in Brussels (so the Czech Republic now and in the threat of veta requires its banks).
The interests of the lobbys also remained because, for example, the highest quality of bananas in the Union had to reach the length of at least 14 cm and were not to show "anonymal decreasing".
Instead, the European Commission was protected by simply harmonising the sustainable non-United national standards which complicated trade.
The EU's fruit and vegetable standards through the opposite of some States have made the evidence that existing Directives lead to food growth.
The candidate for winning in the investigation may also be a EU-based regulation, which requires to be obliged to warn that children are less than 8 years of age without monitoring adults.
The EU has called here to the American research, as the ballons between players lead the cause of the death of children to lose.
Similar restrictions are now applied for children to 14 years when footing into the villages.
Curious ideas are born and home
It is also absolutely absurd to the rules on the single European officials - everyone who has an official in the EU cannot, in view of the sensitivity of the theme for Greece, use the name of Macedonia and have to speak about the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of日).
Server Banko.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economy Laissez Faire, nominated in an investigation other than some of those above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food resources in the territory of the Member State should also be absurd.
The EU has set the maximum amounts of food resources that could be placed on the CRC territory on the day of our entrance into the Union.
Czechland then exceeded, for example, the amounts set in conservated hubs, which threatened him to be highly tempted.
The entity organisations also experienced the idea of paying to some countries because they have no sea, and the idea of providing an attraction to the request for the arrival.
However, these ideas were not in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're handicaped by having no sea.
We request the European Union for refunds," he stated at the subsequence of 2004 the Minister for Agriculture of Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As a argument, we have been able to have a lot of benefits and, in the result of intervention purchases, the full funds he had to be carried out.
In order to continue the Czech Republic, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros according to Palase.
Finally, the European Commission issued the CRC by organizing a tender for purchase of lands which have no access to the sea.
The attractions to the achievement of the attraction were offered to the common Ministry for Local Development, managed by the Minister of Germany (US-DEU), should specifically go to the entry request from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are exceptional
Although the arrangements in the Member States are easily criticised, the EU's efforts to regulate and to deal with the efficient functioning and development of the whole Union are deserving more recognition, according to a number of experts.
The more serious problem, for example, is to take the EU's approach to projects that do not have any significance in the promotion of European integration, but which the Member States have proposed during budget negotiations.
Emotion between the Czech Republic also stresses the fact that the CRC in Brussels must fight the right to the specific labelling of its traditional products, and that it does not succeed in this stock.
Despite the sixth fight against Germany and Rakušana, however, the outdoor rum, whose tradition was in the 19th century, had to rename our producers to a foreigner.
The names of rooms can only be brought from a destillate of nitrogen, not from a sucrose rubber.
In the official list of EU-registered products, such as carlovaric sugars, football and grass, have already been experienced in the worldwide feta and gorgonzole, the martican from the German Lübecka or Parmish bowls.
The EU's protected mark can then also be cut off by a pardubial perimeter and a hot bubble.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm amateur, Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does the man attack that he wants to candidate to the president?
I don't want to be a Senator or a president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I'm going to be in nowhere.
But I can't see the last twenty years of the country's decreasing how evil is running here, people's increased taxes and delays to the east.
I wasn't supposed to be a political ambition.
But if I see something I don't like, I'm trying to get a solution to change it.
And since I had 40 years and I was an independent stranger, I don't have any other chance to influence things than to candidate to the Senator or President.
You got to the Senate, but you've put the walls on the Hrad.
Don't you turn back to people who have chosen you?
I've been saying all the time I'd go to fight for Hrad in the senate choices.
After I've said, if I'm a Senator, I'll be candidate to the President.
My goal but it's not, it's a tool how I can perform my vision.
That's why they're the biggest influence and the strongest mandate.
But it is not just that as a nation we give in economic and television, but that we're going to get everyone who wants to try to change.
It is added to media that deshonre humans and who deceive the freedom of words to lie.
Maybe it was said that I was paying a journalist or I was the advisor of Jiří Paroubk.
Let's go to your vision.
In the fight against Hrad, you have expressed the weight of the political and criminal responsibilities and the returnal ownership of over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
As the President, but you don't have such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can impose the laws.
How do you want to resolve that?
When I was as a citizen to be a free food for the public, it was able to make it.
The problem is politicians - when someone comes with a good way left or right, he accepts it, and the citizens are keeping it.
As an independent independence, I have much more potential to receive support from all Parliament parties.
My priority is that without a page of shopping and dogma I can take something that is best for our country, from each side, and apply it.
Do you think you're more than a man of right or left?
Czech view me feels like people's kidding me to the left.
It's not important for me, if a little left or a little right.
It's important for me, and go forward.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or right, but I want people to join.
I'll always support any publicly good solution, even though it's the KSCHM or ODS, and I'm going to be against the wrong thoughts.
You're kidding when someone says you're a popular.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
If you create a business plan in the company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get close to it.
Someone can call it as a popularism, but all the stories I'm talking about are already working in the world, or significant experts have spoken about them.
But without the support of the parliament, you'll have only passwords.
And you're not going to make it enough in politics.
Or do you think if you are going to follow people and talk to them, you will be able to make you, for example, a criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other chance.
Concerning politics, journalists and publicity and trying to get them on their own side, and they've seen it.
If I have been elected by the President, there is no problem to organize a direct television transfer where I request the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize the vital and criminal responsibility for politics, officers, judges and State representatives.
And they should be informed about why they don't want it.
If a strong personality that will be named for a divorce, it can be pressed on a political scene.
Take the president's direct choice, it was the debt of public pressure.
I say I'm amateur, I'm not genius or intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to search for associations.
I just started in politics, and I'll try to get support for my program.
I'm trying to move myself if it doesn't happen, I'll end six years and return to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura should save Czechland.
I'm not a salvator.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've got a number of people known, if they would also have been in the Senate.
I went after Radim Jančura, the one refused to work for a lot of work.
So, at least, I supported the investigation of journalist Jan Lorenco, who covered underwaters with light tower oil.
I've been candidate to the fact that people are really uncomfortable, but now I'm serious.
Seventy percent of people took the elections, and those who went were choosing the representatives of the establishment.
We're just two independents in the Senate.
People called the Senate to make changes hard.
However, I will fight for my vision, for example for the direct choice of businesses or leaders.
Are you thinking about loading your own pages?
I didn't think about it yet because I don't have time to check the clean past of every potential side, and I don't have money.
I don't have any money to the presidential campaign. There's only 20 thousand on my transparency.
You don't have money?
You're talking about the magic confessions, what's yours?
I'm about 60 million in private property.
In Praza, I have an area of 25 million, a apartment in 10 million, another apartment in eight million, a collection of artworks in approximately 10 million, Aston Martin in 3.5 million and Superb Skode for a million, and then I have a few million per cent.
Instead of Aston Martin, I have because it was my guy dream - I liked James Bond, who was running in the car, was galant to women, and was fighting against badness and divorce.
You drive Aston Martin, you have a possession of 60 million and you don't have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to give your own money to that much.
It's not too convinced.
I don't have 15 million for a campaign.
Is that what I have to debt?
I've been in the campaign for 2,5 million.
I don't have any sponsors, I know that my program is probably not interested.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign from myself.
The expenses for the campaign are actually covering what I'm going to get the senator payment.
But I wouldn't survive from him, for example, I couldn't pay to the sons of Anglic School, which costs 30 thousand per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't have anywhere.
So you're going to continue to business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're losing these activities?
But that doesn't apply to the higher payment.
As I promised, I shared my activities.
For example, the travel operator will become my representative.
People want me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I'm also living from something.
How many were you as a businessman used to break monthly?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, that's what I'm going on.
And if I was the president, I'd finish my business.
The whole conversation will be found in the Saturday issue of the Right.
MVRDV architects are the evidence of that the well-being will not be played only in the head - for example Spijkenisse and recently placed Hora books - 2 photos
"This building seems happy, it looks futurely. Finally, it's to see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, which goes around the street.
Stefan Spermon, IT technology in the nearby big business, says, "Oh, this house is nice."
But I wonder why we still have a book today.
All have Internet, iPady and electronic books.
None of these books in the ancient Holy Books are now volunteered, huh?
Spijkenisse, sitting close to Rotterdam without their own employment opportunities, which do not stand for visit, holds a special record.
It shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid solution, a few years ago the decision was contributed to the general education and set up seven beautifully decorated iron miniatures of ficticial pounds shown on the euro banks.
Success of educational offices, but there was no reversal.
So citizens have known that there is only the only opportunity to happen to Mrs.A.: We have to have a book!
Winy Maas from the rotterdam ethtectonic atelier MVRDV, the master insanely deeply aggressive graphs and prepared for funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted a thing with clothing calm and on competitive negotiations in 2003, appeared with five books under the attention and faces.
And while the committee was still strictly looking around herself and swallowing her arms, the wooden Maas put her gifts on herself according to the size and its activists finished the words "Braw citizen foreign!"
So this is my way on the Hour books in Spijkenisse, such called Boekenberg!
In nine years later, the time was proposed in 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also belongs to the underground parking, supermarket, mail, and a number of residents and a number of homes with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Hora books were designed to the other place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated to the price of Du日 National Wood Award 2012.
The small-master shop, which has not yet been able to offer more than the post-modern area and an unusually harmful advocate for which the white fasad would be more likely to expect milk, is more rich than a little co-co-detecture.
Moreover, but now Spijkenisse has the first public cultural building in his history.
Long Path to Book
Private advice: reading eldorado under the surroundings.
By the middle of the mountain’s mass, though, the outputs, but the rooms and readers are opened up until the topografie waste.
From all sides, the inside is light and transparent, the floor from the burning cabry and the elegant street lamps are expressing the atmosphere of the public area.
The towns are perfect.
You see park lawyers, dogs, boys and girls playing a ball.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally the rules with the books of the fasade are standing, and u--is a great dark space, which is mostly inevitable and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We set the classic camera configuration up to the feet and the reader room outside.
Inside the Hory books is lowly used: In the middle of offices, online books, shock clubs, ecological centres and central houses of technology.
The special comfort is black police on books that are one of the walls, a parapet, and another way I'm throwing rounds.
The view, the structure and the depths are affected by strangers.
Above the unknown building material, the heads of the heads are even decreased by the engineers and the building engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, leader of a project in the city of Spijkenisse, to question the Standard magazine.
So, in one Friday agricultural undertaking, we once arrived on a suitable agricultural waste product.
A lot of years has been used as a foundation under the milimeter round of synthetic wheel.
It's mild and timely effects.
The hard textile will hold one, two seeds, and then he's wounded for the exit to a comprehensive waste.
For the book, it was round - first in such a quantity - sliced on the tables of four meters.
Consciousness of jail and pressure with such a Landbouwplastic (KLP) colors in dark, homogeneous and fashionable material, which covers a little like a new car and a little like sports and bottles.
After 105 steps, you'll get to the top.
At the end of approximately 500 metres of a long journey, you will be rewarded in a literary coffee not only by a fantastic view of the city but also by the Netherlands croquets and figs in flowers.
They are concerned about the atmosphere, but mainly about the right wheel of the air in the fire.
The gifts for the new soul
"If you wouldn't believe it, but this house is a lot of glassed areas of show project about ecology," says Trouborst.
He's getting out and healing the earth's heat.
Though the Mount of Books stands under the spring, the sun lights inside only shortly, and it is also in the sundays.
Widely beautiful tree vessels standing around to the spread fashion serve as a shadow and a large part of the sun.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of them will be advised to the full automatic role.
Stefan Spermon, the original skeptic of the IT, has already visited a new book.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the factor of the traditional Chinese medical Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even marks as "recently expected soul" Spijkenisse.
D日: Each inhabitant of the city was invited to open a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
This should have been the first place of optical scales now not completely equipped with the book that is currently reading 70,000 cows.
The concept has been pronounced.
The police are complete.
"There is nothing worse than a half empty book," says Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every people now have a certain relationship with the new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if she'd just be for a holiday.
The MVRDV has occurred in the king's discipline, which is called in the professional garage to create identity.
The bridegroom of the psalmist.
Let him be young and unpleasant.
This is finally the default point for identity.
"The Germans have to play more roles"
Germany remained voting during the decision of Palestinian adoption.
According to the United States and Europe of Stephen Szaboa, the Berlin balances the harm of diplomatic food.
Deutsche Welle: Germany signed at the beginning of the week that it would vote against us to the observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then, but Berlin stopped the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful for his special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think he's not supporting the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, but it would not be too critical to Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also remained voting when the establishment of an airport area was held.
Finally, it was the NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take care of serious international topics?
Yeah, that's right.
The D'em is that it just changes its policy, and it is directly from the policy that was suchly governed by the United States, towards the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult that Europeans do not have coherent and unique policies.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They're expected to play an independent role, but they're not aware of it.
I think they're just in their own role, but they're on the way to the "normal" policy.
To the business policy, which is in France or in the Great Britain.
What specifically does the "normal" policy of the German view mean?
It shows the preparation to engage in national interests and positions which are independent of the positions of the United States or of European partners.
I think the German foreground policy is motivated by economic policy, thus exporting and its relations with certain agencies, whether Russia, China or the Near East.
The economic interests of Germany are in certain ways other than economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Has economic interests affected the position of the nearby-day conflict and voting in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a big apartment on the Middle East, especially in the states around the Perish Value.
Therefore, it must be careful not to fear the public, but not the elite in Arab countries.
Everyone plays a role.
But I wouldn't even want to add this too much importance, that's not a whole single relationship.
However, it plays every important role in German considerations.
Did German relations with the United States damage when Germany remained voting in both important decisions, for example in voting about Palestinian?
I think in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding for German position.
That's why I don't think it was so dramatic wrong as in the question of Libye.
I hope Germany even has a certain respect.
It also signals that it must be considered a international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States apologize for the veto.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European nations?
These divergences were based on the American Internal Policy.
I think the Government of Obam is probably a significant understanding of the European position.
But in the light of the more political practice, this position, obviously, cannot be public.
I think differences in opinions are not as large as they seem.
When you look at the relations between Obama and the Ministerial President Netanjahu, Obama is not overwhelmed by Netanjahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to put its difficult relationships with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think this is exactly a challenge for Germans.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little easier if there was a coherent and unique European policy that would not happen at the present time.
Thus, they cannot be part of the larger lines, and they have to throw things out of their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the leader role in the future and press Europe to the European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, but for a relationship with Israel.
That was a sensitive topic.
But I think Germans have to play an independent role.
See Germany himself in the role of a significant international player? Do you want to overcome the main role?
Or is the leader role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not usual, it is still inappropriate, and for this country it is still more difficult to play the role of this country.
For example, when we look at Europe's crisis, then, when Germany accepts a role, the anti-Germanal reactions will occur.
That doesn't make the Germans easy.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be circumcised by enemy countries.
In this regard, Germany is much more difficult than the United States.
It must be acceptable for various neighbors and views, and it is not easy.
The impact of the United States on European Policy is now increasing, but the EU does not comply with this vaccine at this time.
Germans will just have to play more roles.
Even if they do not like it, it is unfair to them, and it will do it much more unfair -- that's la life!
Stephen Szabo is the representative of Director Transatlantic Aëmy in Washington, the institution in which academics and experts in Europe and North America together study the challenges of the transatlantic community.
In addition, the German Marshall Fund was a member, where it was specialized for German policies, the United States for Policy and the transatlantic relations.

And even then it isn't possible if the rights are home.
"For foreigners is still more difficult to protect their marks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in Taylor Wessing office, which is specialised to violate protection rights on the East.
Every week there's a new case on my screen table.
A few letters are enough for the painters to log out their marks.
From the Gu's tags, for example, Lu-Gu's becomes and instead of Prada, they are allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies are legally copied, perhaps the manufacturer of the sports goods of Puma.
Pattloch opens the computer with the records of the signature office in Peking.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company left there to protect the trade mark Zegna DF Puma. A artificial name that also parasites in the modern home of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that China's misters of the world are in copying and corrupting the mental property.
In large towns there are several business houses in which they are sold exclusively.
Pattlock cases, however, are different. From the confirmation of their man’s hands, it is against the fact that the Chinese firms receive from the marking authority completely the right to use of the labels already protected somewhere else.
Chinese it is called "Bang Mingpai", associated label.
This word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
These are mentioned by women who catch rich men.
The Chinese authorities don't have any fault.
"He's hurting the business, we've got to shoot it," he calls Pattloch.
"It's going to be divorced, the exceptional position disappears, the damage of the image is bitter."
Financial losses and legal costs achieved by animals are going to millions, especially in delightful showing products.
According to the data of the CLSSA market investigation company, China is 15 billion euros per year in the largest market of Luxus species and the market that grows most.
However, the wheel of doubtful records in the register can be achieved difficultly and something is worth.
The management can be extended to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports the cases when the court rejected the complaints because the exhibited name has become after a long time of the duration of the "permanent reality".
When a complainting party has mildness, he must pay the plagiator yet because he harmed his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
Known cases are also related to graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler split the legal dispute with the manufacturer of building machines of Sana, a company who recently took the German manufacturer to the Putzmeister beton mixture.
Therefore, Chinas are still able to use an emblem like the Mercedes star.
The Geely company, who bought Volvo, used a moderated logo that was at BMW. Spor was equipped, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of the modern goods in Lacoste spent in China with padelants from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities don't have any fault.
However, the CTMO Science Authority admits that there was too small number of employees and rooms in 2010.
But in the latest year, "the process of work returned from the nutrition to the normal."
For example, the number of non-processed tariff procedures was decreased by 22 per cent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, it is still waiting for 81 500 sty.
Something against this business is sweet
As it is often in China, it's impressive numbers.
In the latest year, CTMO was assigned more than 1,4 million requests for the protection of the label, which is at least a third of more than in 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China has a list of new records around the world.
This also applies to the start of all valid protected labels -- it's a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011 1,8 billion Juan were selected on payments.
This simply means that each entry is 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Starting against this dispute is some canabis, as it shows the case of the German family company gauchnberg.
This counterpart has been fighting against the Chinese plagiator for more than seven years.
However, Germans achieved that his illegal production of imited car parts was canceled.
However, the padelator has provided the Chinese rights to the name of the joynberg continued.
They themselves mentioned it because the reception in Germany cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, president of the leading company of Lucnberg Chemical Specialities in Mnich.
The CTMO Science Authority also refused to visit the Mnichov company.
In two other instances, although joynberg had the rights, but the refusal in the past continues to fight today.
You need to give a terrible attention.
Now the matter is negotiated by the Supreme Court.
Wentzler's confidence that things will lead to a good end and praise the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The management is extremely costly, and we have a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs could not be calculated. In the company, they had to even look for hundred years of old writings to present evidence.
Five years ago, the company of gladnberg offered a "high sixthird amount in yours" for the compensation of the dispute.
"You see what this means for us," Wentzler says.
It is threatened that the dangers from the East will include Europe.
And it's in the case when the imitators are there to ensure unsaved marks.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer wanted to notify the name of gladnberg for the skin and skin in Germany.
This trade activity has been reported a long time, however it has been able to reject the registration.
"There must be a terrible attention," Wentzler says.
He and Pattloh's lawyer advises German businesses to be very careful when negotiating with China.
It doesn't suffice for international mark rights, but foreigners should have "all things that are worth protecting in any way, to log in also in China," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much worse than registration.
Consequently, if the company of gladnberg in the last time of its drama is aligned with the mark, then it will probably have to pay license payments for its own name, it explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pressed from the market in a slow segment.
World Day of War against AIDS: dupning, song, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation - and in Switzerland, the poor people are happy for their parents who died in AIDS.
The trend of the connection that overcomes more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there's a dupning: Cowboy high boats, basketball boats, damical boats and dominic mokasines are looking for takt park and ≥e.
One-two-three-four.
Then they will take the voices of the songs quickly -- Alt, Bas, Tenor, and Susan -- they're slow, mothers, and they're swimming each other.
The 29-year-old leader Fiete Hopfa is too highlighting it from his textile boats when he connects his voices with his very wild gestes.
It's Monday evening. In the musical song of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, it's a new song of Imbongi.
It came to fifty songs and songs between 23 and 69 years from human genetic research.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple track, each congregation vote has a different text and more in a very strange language - a zelule that speaks 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesoth, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland.
Help for Success
Unids, the United Nations AIDS Agency, believes that there are 34 million people who are infected by HIV virus throughout the world.
From that, 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
In Switzerland, there are 245 000 poor people who died in AIDS.
HIV's position is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 poor people who died in AIDS, he found the Voices for Africa’s patterns in Germany in the village of Estonian.
70 of them visits a second degree school.
In 15 or 20 euros a monthly pattern can be taken.
It guarantees children school, school uniform, and one warm eating daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means in the language "the story reporter" or "the one who is great".
The gas bantuan can't speak anybody in this room, just sing.
Some ten years ago, the congregation makes a song in this foreign mixed words, and sometimes brings them back, from which they can be conceived: South Africa.
At the air distance of 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, the north of the Swiss Kingdom of the village of Estoni, which depends on the potential of the votes of the German congregation.
Fourteen percent is finished
There lives some 2,000 people, some still in simple white or smoked wheels, and a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they have followed you the HIV virus.
It is in Estonia to see in the small place of the whole Switzerland: the highest level of HIV efficiency, the latest expected life in the world according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of a man's pregnant, which evidently reduces the risk of half orders, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland are weakened immunity viruses in themselves, and there is no rare rareness that they die in 30 years of age.
This village opened the congregation at the common road to Africa in June 2005. However, the members of Imbongi saw many children in the streets that missed not only family care, but pursued all: food, clothing, education.
Without finished school education, they have no chance in the poor country.
At the beginning, it was still a private setting of individuals, which allowed for a few euros to send a child to school and give him a warm eating daily.
However, a year later, the assembly of the "Voices for Africa", which since that time has been aware of the poverty of the parents who died on AIDS, is professionally.
Sexually transmissible infections
What are the most serious sexually transmissible diseases?
A bacterial SPI belongs to syfilis, chlamydie and powder (gonorea).
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papilomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Munchs and swords belong to the parasite SPI.
Who belongs to the most achieved group?
Syfilis and the pocket are mostly shown in men who have sex with men.
Robert Kocha's statement is that at least four of the five cases of syphilides reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, there are sexually transmissible diseases that occur often, chlamidae infections, trichomonades, candidose, potassium and human papilomavires.
HIV is a relatively small increase between the heterosexual adults in us, but about 20 per cent of people newly affected HIV appears to this group.
Young people have chlamidae infections increasingly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European investigations, three quarters of all infections are related to young people from 15 to 25 years.
Moreover, among young people often have human papilomavirs.
How did the infections have been developed?
Not all sexually transmissible diseases must be reported.
The beginning of the syphilide was more than 3698 diseases in 2011, according to Robert Kocha Institute, from 1697 diseases in 2001.
The beginning of newly infected HIV has been reduced since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2700 cases.
It's a decade less than a year ago.
What symptoms are warning about disease?
Infectional diseases can be caused by genital disorders, disorders, exhausts, pains in the powder and powder or brada da.
However, no pain or other symptoms are often affected, and they will not be observed.
How can you protect you?
The dangers of injuries may reduce condoms, but they do not offer a gradual protection.
Because sexually transmissible diseases can also be partly transmitted infections from uncleanness and hard physical contact.
Therefore, the experts recommend regular investigation, in particular in the case of regular sex partners.
In the case of a frequency, it is possible to treat SPI and prevent other followers.
Thanks to the pattern, good gifts, and in the unfortunate range of honorers that the congregation makes a song throughout Germany, the money is deceived.
"We have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitania," President Annette Lennartz said.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious woman who can handle it.
He also cares for the kids of the kids, for example in some of the grandfathers.
Gogo, as he says to old women in the language, is the villages.
Some of them also took 14 poverty, gave them a shot over their head, and they were trying to get children every day in uniforms to school.
Children who have no one are going to the Khanyisile arrest, a single woman who pays together as two kitchens that daily carry for more than 200 hungry kids.
Moreover, "Voices for Africa" found the school of the chickens, set two corners, and together with the American health organisation of the PSI, many people in the village were allowed to test HIV.
It's not clear, even though the illness in the whole country is so apparent, everyone's silent about it.
King of 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely tobacco," says Annette Lennartz, "for she has what to do sexually."
In fact, a lot of wonderful in the country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III., is known as his unnecessary life member.
Polygamies instead of democracy.
In addition, this country has also been a valid life way to win that HIV virus has expanded so much in the past decades.
But even a lot of migration workers who have driven the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that the condoms are free on each corner, "but no one uses it.
Culture is another, unsaved."
To at least a little support for cultural exchange, the Ibongi congregation travels once in two, three years together in South Africa and sing a song full of disturbance, fighting, confidence in the future and self-consciousness of black, many in the southern area of black continent are still known from the time of the apartment.
The bus full of white people who sing songs in the words of black - such a assessment brings not only joy and joy, but has already cut off swords in many big poetry soldiers.
The road also leads to Esitania, where the songs visit the children of which they have a pattern.
Even if this village triggers you'll find on maps, it's more known in the valley of the Eyeweni river.
"Go to Esitania, there's a light," people say there.
And when you come back to Heidelberg, which is from here a airway of 8733 miles, to the dumping songs in the experiment at Bergheimer Street, you see that this light lights here.
Messenger: NASA discovered in Merkur Lead
Sonda Messenger found evidence of the ice plane of Merkur.
The ice cover could have a temperature of 20 meters.
The American National Aviation and Cosmonic Agency (NASA) showed the existence of ice on the Merkur planet.
Although the nearest sun is located, there is also a frozen water that comes out of three studies that published the Professional magazine Science on Thursday.
Sonda Messenger found evidence that in this planet, which lies in the permanent shadow, there is a ice cover.
This is evidently at least 30 metres and maybe even up to 20 meters strong.
This water came according to all of the comet or maybe of the asteroids that came to Merkura.
But let's not find ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, he said the leader of the workers at the Messenger Society, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Merkur may reach up to 426 degrees Celsia.
However, findings can help us to explain how water and other fundamental elements of life have been reached into other solar systems.

The pictures of spirital galaxies have been colored by artical parts.
The collection published by the European South observer shows a number of thousands of light years remotely from Trifid in the Shoot Star.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (separated by three parts, three-clothed), because the dark powder divides the burning heart of this star generation to three parts.
In the Hadonosh constellation, astronomy photographed the precondition of cosmical snakes: 400 million light years from the Earth have a two-scale galaxie nuclear on themselves and must unexpectedly reach colision.

Our views in the universe: most important telescopes
The remote view was found in 1608, Hans Lipperhey. Before Galilee Galilee, he used her for a year later to observe the stars.
Since that time, optical remote views have continued to increase - and the views of the chairs are still deeper.
The largest distant view of the world was for 30 years, and it was from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the observer Palomar near San Diega.
The look on this image had a five meters of average.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in the American Ar.
It allows you to watch into the universe by using just two stars, each of which has an average of 8.4 metres.
Inland Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is very important. Only the look is measured at the average of 10,4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
Yet, his prospect reaches the amount of 11 meters.
Left income: the telescope is assessed by a hackard in an outer corner, which refers to its movement.
The hobby-Eberly telescope is also fixed in Texas.
His speciality is a high strengthening of light flow.
Despite the relatively small prospect, this has been compared to the largest spectacular distances of the world.
Aid to the radiotelescope in Arecibu (Portorico) is observed by the guardians in the universe after outermost signals.
This radiotelescope has an average of 305 meters.
At the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - search for for foreign intellectuality - each owner of the computer can help that provides its calculated performance.
See the observer of the European South observer (ESO) in Chile Andes.
There's Very Large Telescope -- and he honors his name.
This remote view with totally four points can also light the central infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large distance is also planned for the Chile observators of the ESO.
His main screen has a full of 42 metres and has to be charged from almost 1000 screen elements.
Photos can be calculated first in 2018.
Two Keck's distant views on the Hawai Sop Mauna Kea were considered the greatest world in 2007.
They offer two stars, each with an average of 10 meters.
Keck's remote views are part of Mauna Kea observators, which, besides them, are watching in the universe and using Subaru and IRT.
Moreover, Mauna Kea has to get a new telescope screen - with a 30-meter screen.
Here you can wonder her on the picture.
However, the most significant ideas from the universe have been made by Hubble's kosmical distant view.
The remote world collections have been provided from 24 April 1990.
The Cosmic Telescope Kepler spent from March 2009 after extra-social planets - especially after those who are residents.
On February 2, 2011, NASA notified that since the start of the mission, 1235 candidate planets were found.
The last preparation is documented on the image before the start of the universe telescope Kepler.
The worldwide distance view of James Webba (JWST) will be shot first in 2018 in the universe on the Ariane cancer brand.5.
The primary screen of the universe infrared telescope has an average of 6,5 meters.
One of the telescope tasks is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxie after the Great Trick.
Scientists get out of the ice even in the southern field of Merkur.
However, there are no helpful data for this, for the Messenger crosses around this planet far closer to the north field.
Radar motion has already shown a few decades of the ice is on Merkur.
Thanks to the Sond of Messengers sent in 2004 and is the first one that is around Mercur has now the security.

Searching for steps in the country where 97 years of people are still relatively young.
Let's go to the fire of Talish, we can call a romantic divoce.
Microbus shooting on the street with a lot of shoes has divided a lot of frozen coppers, wooden rivers and simple cell buildings.
Everything's green and famous, almost seems to be in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the nearest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few miles away.
There is a Kawish ethnic group of Talish, which is not too known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijan and experience very high.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is too monumental from the Soviet times, which is sometimes uncomfortable to the small mountains.
The tourists from Europe will not eat here: the accession from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too difficult.
323 miles are needed eight hours, because the road is only one-country.
The poor richness for which the countries of the Caspian Sea have not yet been here forward.
However, Pilate Fatulajev (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attack.
"Baku celebrated the Great price of Eurovise in May - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year," says Fatulajov.
He's a director of the Museum of Eternality, like the only one in the world.
Here is a documented life of almost eight Tutches of Talish from the surrounding area that are hundred years older. Fatulajava shows black white photos.
That's my grandmother, he was 120 years old.
At age 136, he was born a child.
However, this museum’s star is a shepherd of the sheep Shirali Müslumov, which was evidently 168 years old.
However, a family not exists.
And because the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Müslumov's seems to be generally doubtful.
"He was born in this section in 1805 and he died in 1973," explains Fatulajiv.
This man was probably three times married and had 23 children.
Did Sherali Muslim not fail in his office for a few decades?
However, he hears about flying people in Central Asia, i\brandt Scholz, the gerontolog of Maxe Planck Institute in Rostock.
"In the past many people live in some China, Japan, or in the valley Hunza in Pakistan," Scholz says, "as well, in Sardinia lives extremely many old men."
However, because of the lack of foundations, no evidence of the depth cannot be provided, especially when the matrix is missing.
Each day the glass of diluted olive
But it is that people around Lerica often get the Bible’s idea.
There are now 20 people who are 100 years old.
Why, then, he lives here on the south of so many flying people?
The Azerbaijan Prince Farid Mugimzadeh explains this to the special genes of Talis.
The director of Fatulje's Museum, in contrast, will say that it is in the survival.
However, it is that the caloric food of the Talish, who love meat, bread and mainly milk products, and of which many drink the glass of the solved oil daily, is so healthy, it does not seem to be adequate in bromatological view.
Or is it a pp-way way of life that holds young people? in Cengemiran, a small place near the city of Lerik, Rubab Mirzajev lives.
In 97 years, this agricultural width is still relatively young.
The Mirzaje, which claims that he has 143 flows, lives in a simple tree house that is typical for the whole Kawkaz region.
He's sitting on the ground with a mask that is increasingly cool.
Under one hour, eight people live here, other than one of the sons of Mirzai and the daughters.
Two little kids are surrounding around.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for hosts, given in typical "armade" glasses.
The white teeth of Mirzay makes a row finished and hides a long dark blond copy that is proudly discovering her son before us.
I've always missed my hair with milk, so they didn't look to me and hold their color.
"I never used a champion like that," Mirzaje says.
Month Income to Life Success
Eat only what was buried out of her own court, race, brambers, games.
For my whole life, I didn't miss food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst for the Second World War.
But everything improved when the boat took the "loyal father" Gaydar Alijev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of the old woman.
Yet, the culture that works around the position of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, does not recognize the border in Azerbaijan.
He was at power until 2003, and then took his son Ilham's boat.
Elderly people in Azerbaijan at least don't suffer.
Mirzajeva gets 230 manates each month (approximately the same amount in the euros). This is in the more degree of the interest that can be used well.
And maybe he has the truth for a long time, the son of Mirzai: "The old people eat in our culture a great severity."
They live in large families, they are loved, deceived and happy.
It doesn't matter to stay alive as long as
The concept of "human rights" is missing
The revolution came back to Cahira.
Developed demonstrations in Cairo have discovered the deep diversity of the country.
The island is discussed on the future position based on the right of the sherry.
The Egyptian president did not investigate the past.
We have to create a transition.
"And because it's going to happen to us, I'm responsible for me, before people and before God," he said in the state TV.
His word was appointed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian Cops, Liberals, Muslims, and secondary persons.
All of you, even in the dead opposition, are scared.
Furthermore, fear of the "God's State" in the Nile for the grace of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he limited the competence of the Constitutional Court and extended his own to "teach revolution".
However, what a 61 - year - old engineer who has the title of the doctor of the American University in South California really wants to save, there are no Egyptians or the world.
Should justice be saved by power?
234 paragraphs, which the Constitutional Constitutional Contracts with the overall islamists have approved in the 15-year-old Maratone, are partly provoked by anxiety.
Like in the former institutions, it is also said that the jurisdiction is based on "the principles of the Islamic Rights".
But what does it mean "the principles"?
It was and it was an explanation, and it can be afraid that the islamics will use this unexplained form and the associated legal free space with it for a closer interpretation of charity.
At least this illustrates the new added paragraph: In all cases relating to charity, it is necessary to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important islamic institutions in the country with a great impact on the whole Sunnite Islam.
It doesn't have to, but it may mean that Clerus will carry out the supervision of legislation, which would bring the justice to real derogation of its rights.
There are many things to exaggerate in the system
The problem is also that civil rights of military courts must continue to be maintained.
These courts served as the Government of Mubar to combat opposition.
After the fall of dictature, there were up to 11 000 civilians in the military band.
As we say, "the right basis of the Egyptian family should also be protected and supported by its moral and values."
This is so inaccurately formulated on the legal side that by means of this paragraph, the State institutions could even control the contents of films and films.
In a comprehensive word, it doesn't mean anything else than censure.
The other paragraph does not mean in writing the explicit equality of men and women.
Thus, another paragraph prohibits the anonymity of the prophet Mohammed and his exposures.
Yet, it remains a disappointment, and how it will be cut off.
It also doubts that it's prohibited to make people's relief.
In this case, is the president's charitation already enough or an impression on the rights identifiers?
More explanation, as many other in this record, which Mursí presents to sign and, according to his words, "very soon" will present the Egyptians after the human vote.
"Revolution returned"
A few weeks has become opposition against the past islamists.
Tenty-years of people, in an unusual weight, were injured on Friday evening at Tahrir in Cahire and promised to destroy the constitutional list, even before it began to pay.
"Revolution returned and we won," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was located in the presidential elections in the third place.
Nobelovy price and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej declared that the establishment belongs to the rubber.
By the middle of the service of short news, Twitter accused Mursi's prospect that they wanted to carry out "power against democracy".
"When the referendum is announced, we'll go to his palace and take it," said Jasir Said opposition.
"We're not yet injured, the blood of our brothers has not yet been distressed," the Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Chalida Aliho.
A number of judges notified that they would not want to observe references that would become invalid.
"The Coran is our mouth."
The well-organised Muslim brothership has announced the democracy, but not at Tahrir, but after a hot prayer at the second March of Nile before the Cairo University.
It was involved in many injured women and salafists who called, "Lid requires the application of God's law."
They called Mursy, "Clean the earth!" and they assured, "The Koran is our mouth."
The fight for the survival of the symbolic object of Tahrir, on which everything started, would probably be a similar civil war.
The Murs' suppliers were obviously not trying to risk it.
The Muslim brotherhood declared that the rebels and the contemporaries would be voted and clearly eating.
Now it is time to leave people at election hours to decide where the country is to go.
Of course, it is considered the benefit of islamists.
"The word "Listen Rights" doesn't appear anyway"
The constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all community forces, hands Hafize Abu Sa'd.
The eighty-five-year maintenance of human rights and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EEHR) held the members of the Muslim Brothership when they were in execution or standing before the court for Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are unfaithful for them.
That's why he was killed, condemned and arrested.
"And now there are no words of 'human rights' or once," it's discussing "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of the power of Mursy on all three potential folders in the State gave this lawyer to reject.
These measures are a scandal prosecution against the democratic rules of games and they will tell Egypt to a new division.
"Instead of the president to strengthen the civil society, he has actually cancelled it," Sa'd urges.
However, without civil society organisation, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community that follows the storage of the ideological groups in Nile with mixed science and stress.
That could be his way.
The demonstrant at Tahrir's place warns, "You created a monster you can't control anymore."
Norwegian cancer: The most amusing fish in the world?
Five million people live in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life not only in Europe but even in the world.
Could the country's success secret be connected to the local appointment for extraordinary fishing?
Take a few surroundings.
Put them into the hroms of the spine and mokrebal tools.
Let it lie a week.
So you get those paralyzing cracks of cancer, one of the largest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Osla.
There's a snow, a beautiful look here, and in the air it's going to grow everywhere.
Rakfisk is a sealed powder weakened in the water for a year to a year - depends on how much you want to feed the fish.
As it gets hot and starts to be cold, Norways start here in Fagernes to meet a festival dedicated to how to say it is the best, the most underlying eating.
"You sound the syrs and then you pick it with a glass aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional farmer, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the past festival.
All around us, people eat small fish bottles and drink them with a large quantity of alcohol.
"Some people have aquavit than a cancer," he says Havard.
The drink can overcome the pigs.
I'll try a couple of kitchens.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's a similar sushi cut that was on the long way of the bus.
Rakfisk is a very different product when poverty was in Norway, and since there were no springs, the fish on the ground was thrown into water and salt vessels.
Then in the winter, when they were well deceived, they dropped out and dipped - the senses often have been deceived by alcohol.
Only one generation before, thousands of Norves were required to leave their country and seek work, and they were immigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population grows - more than 13% of the immigrants are being attached to large numbers of jobs, higher performances and a vast care system.
Sweden's residents, an old rival, which was a lot more rich than Norway, are going to work country.
The cancer is viewed as something important, insufficient, even though the relatively injured part of the Norwegian past.
It belongs to the lovers of food on the market.
Although the dear is everything - small birds or sandwich will get you out to 9 litres (14 dollars) for a kitchen.
Norway is often not in the worldwide reports - and it seems that most people do so.
The name is Anders Breivika, a right racial extremist, who shot 77 men, women, and children in the past year, still mentioned in disturbance.
Instead, the shooting is called "awake from July 22".
Norways can only be hard to believe that one of them was able to be such brutality and murder in their peaceful country.
According to the present riches of Norway, one of the largest world-wide and gas developments from the beginning of the 70th century is grown.
"But the robe is not the only d'you, why it is so good to us," he says by giving a toilet with a lack of cancers of our teacher, which with his long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents the prototype of the northern goodbye.
We're like you're saying, people's appreciation.
Her English, as the angle of the people now, is absolutely unusual.
We're not present, we don't have any evidence.
Norway is very careful with its valuable riches - other than a small percentage of money is invested in the special fund for the future generation.
When all the rest of the years leading to the world’s financial burden was lost of money that they had not, Norways had strongly appealed bridges on their midst.
"When we can lie in the winter and walk out of the sea, we're happy," he says.
"And eat cancer," adds with anxious smile.
I'm standing in the snow in front for something to eat - I've got enough cancer.
Such a burger's likely something else, and he's nicely stupid.
But the evening is a ridiculous fish again.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where the cancer is given for dinner and where the hosts choose the best, or more for which the most important fish is.
They have this connection to a living TV transfer, where the modernizer is a motif-enclosed baller with cancer.
It's like an Eurovision fifth competition.
"What hair do you have for the best fish there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
"This is our pointing, Havard."
It's cool and smile.
It's a man that may be capable of aquavite.
Or maybe all of those fish.
Enrique Pena Neto from Mexico has difficult start
As the mexican president Enrique Pena Neto prepares for the overtake of the authority, Will Grant from BBC looks at the challenges that he faces, and for the mixed expectation of his fellow believers.
Transport to Mexico City is particularly bad at the present time.
In the towns that are stumbled and in the best times, the ocean defense was closed with a number of key routes to the main city and caused by the chaos streets.
However, the aim was not to prohibit those incoming to get to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing the Parliament.
The new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Neto will receive the presidential sherpe and we will transfer the leadership of the people.
It's a special job.
Mexican, however, has been a well-economic conduct in the period of Felipe Calderon’s department, but the country is in the burning of drug war, which has already taken 60,000 lives for six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence," said President Pena Neto to the American President Barac Obam at the Ovalous Work at the beginning of this week.
I will set up a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he hit his hand with the American President, President Pena Neta received the political experience as a holder of his home country of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also separate in his old household, a human and divorced country that circumcises the main city.
Right man.
For example, in the foreign town Valle del Bravo, they are in good place.
Citizens attribute the development of tourism in the aircraft and the building of infrastructure.
Now you can get to the city after one of the new valleys that Pena Neto has allowed to build. These valleys are a great improvement in the deep and hot roads that have been here before.
The boards with his name are also on the wall of the modern sport centre and the imponent interactive museum with the climate changes.
"We expect it to bring a permanent change," said a friend and a political partner Gabriel Olver Hernandez, a state lawyer from President Pena Nieta, the Partie of the institutional revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope in interesting and interesting changes in security and economies that our countries are so necessary.
After uninterrupted 81 years of power, the PRI side was embarrassed by Vicent Fox.
Sender Olver admits that after 12 years abroad of the presidential palace Los Pinos is expected inside the side of Enriqua Pena Neta.
And he refuses to reject the opposition that characterizes the new president as a man without a substantial scope.
He's a very direct man, very excited with the outstanding vision of the country.
He's a great stater, and he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand of the state, this isn't the idea of having many of his former artists.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, it cannot be a contrast with the depth streets of Valle del Bravo.
He is invaded under the remote findings in many places in the main city of Mexico.
And problems in self-righteous community are also endured and cities.
At the beginning of this year, armies were allowed to help the control of drug gangs operating in the fourth, especially the armies are violent against women.
Only in the last two years, there were an incredible deterioration of the body of murdered women in empty places.
At the time of Pena Neto-Gener, more than 1.000 women were killed in Mexico, which is much more than in the notoric violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place synonymous for murdering innocent women.
In the best case, Pen Neta's criticism states that when he acted in the office, he failed to deal with the problem of women's murder.
And in the worst case, his leaders are accused of closing the eyes.
In the Beton House, typical for the quarter, Irinea Buendia shows me the photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and weeps the weeping.
According to the official version, Marian burned suicide in 2010.
However, her family will make her killed her partner.
"When I came to her home, it seemed like her body was somebody lost," Mrs. Buendia said.
There were signs on him after the signs, and it has already started an immortal depression.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the image on the wall, right next to the cross on which the only word is "righteousness".
Yet, this is what the family says, exactly what they were born.
The State authorities were taking me as if I was older injury, tissue, and library.
They want you to accept what they're saying and quiet.
"But it can't be right when so many mistakes and reminds me," he says.
Sherpa that President Pena Neto will receive on Saturday is granted a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tenty families in Mexico were committed by violent crime, and the new president promised that after his action in the office, they would be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was," the lawyer Pri Olver says in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the family of victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid.
Bradley Manning wasn't going to a bad inquiry, a strong military prosecutor
The military prosecutor is trying to repeat Bradley Manning's statement regarding the brutal deal in the ship.
The hearing is focused on Manning's residence in a military band in Quantico town in Virginia.
Obhajow wants the case to be refused on the basis of a brutal consequence with Manning in the service.
The soldier is accused of crossing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to show that the soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest injury of the secret material in the United States history, has dismissed a lot of opportunities to move to a cruel deal that was evidently suffering in the military band.
The military prosecutor of May. Ashden Fein, at the cross-exhortation of the soldier Manning at the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, stated that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with a decade unit during nine months of connection in Quanticu in Virginia, did not show any punishment for a bad detention.
The cross votes that occurred during the hearing that was conducted on our own would be able to refuse the case leading against Manning from a cruel detention at the time of a commitment that was the same about the suicide, passed on the day after Manning witnessed that he thought of self-mortality.
Analytic military divorce arrested in June 2010 is accused of the claim of thousands of secret documents in their service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
On the Friday hearing, the military prosecutor Fein and Manning passed the forms that the deputy complied after meeting Manning in the Vatican Science in Quanticu, where he was held in a higher care regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The centers of Manning asked questions and mentioned his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday on these formulaes, Manning admitted that the detention of his guards had been valued as "excellent" and the total income in the equipment was valued as "very professional".
The formularies do not show any complaints on bad intentions, although the elderly Manning directly asked how he was involved with him, Fein said.
Maning replied that the fears of various problems had exposed usually and that the teens who visited him talked with him about these threats and indicated that they would be concerned, but these problems did not be recorded.
"They've asked "no problem" (after they discussed anxieties) and that was not necessarily meaning that I hadn't changed about them," said Manning.
Justice Mr. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he didn't move his person to congratulate in January 2011 to meet the Commission on self-mord thoughts that he had issued in the formula for a few months ago.
Maning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve the reduction of the 'prevention of hurt' regime.
The Armageddon noted that in this restrictive regime (one degree under self-mord control regime) it was used for the protection and security of the residents.
"I wanted the overseers to learn that I'm okay and I wanted to cancel this regime of prevention of hurt... so that I could enjoy an increased quality of life as I saw it," said Manning.
Maning witnessed on Thursday his prison in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before it was transported to the branch office at the basic sea halls in Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was thinking of self-mortality in Kuwait, and one time he was throwing down with a cup of warmness.
He concluded that he was not allowed to do what he would be with him and what was happening in the world was very exciting.
"My world was sorrowed only on the foundation of Arifdjan, on the key," said on Thursday Manning.
I thought I'd die in that hole.
Maning noted that after the arrival to Quantica he was working a day (minus 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small target without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one matrace, cover, tissues, other clothes and brilliants.
He said he was trying to walk because the sleep or only beds were in the past day against the rules.
Manning noted that ́s sleeping by the light from the outer side of the cell in the eyes.
He noticed that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned on the other side, they wake him up and had to turn back.
Maning's legal representative gave the formal complaint to the arrest with the soldier Manning in January 2011.
Maning was transferred to the military campaign in Fort Leaven日th in Kansas in April 2011.
On Wednesday, Judge Manning also asked for an accusation that he raised in the quarter responsibility, as regards the fact that after one night he had been brought to sleep in her goal in Quanticu, he was also needed to stand astray before the guard and the remaining companions at the ransom calculation.
Maning said he was not allowed to hide his cover.
In the Friday hearing of the executed judge Manning, he said that from the order of his guards, he had a cover that he could cover, but admitted that no one gave him the order for her department.
On Thursday, Manning told him that he was born to sleep late night, because he tried to show that he was not dangerous.
Manning noted that he said to the dealer he could use a feed from his bottom of the cup or his names to hurt, but he didn't do it.
Manning said that this night was removed from his cells his bottom, his tissues and brilliants.
His legal representative hopes that the court will take his experience in the past of his distortion and that, in the case of his certificate before the military court, whose beginning is expected at the beginning of the next year, his sentence is clearly reduced.
The complaint concluded that it planned that Manning was recognised to wine in lower criminal acts and that he would fight against the final accusation because they were too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is planned for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will cover the valid submissions as authorised.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was maintained in accordance with the rules relating to all arrested in relation to maximum care.
Aid to the enemy, an anti-legal cause of publication of reporting documents on the Internet, the transfer of information on national security and the claim of public property or registers.
He will be accused at all points, he may be judged on the survival.
My Mexico-American identities
He says that many people were needed to leave Mexico from the insufficient options that are there.
Mexican people have a worth to win those who are gone; when they take hard time, he says.
Navarrette says the American Mexico are lapened between two worlds.
At the last journey to the main city of Mexico, I just went through the dave and came to the Imigrant Agenda Agenda, where I had a problem.
The pigs showed one of the two fronts: one for "Mexico" and the second for "Extranjeros" ("Cizinci").
I've been there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in California, and my whole life was called Mexican.
It's a ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston named "Iry" and my friends in New York are "Italy".
So afterward, I ended with the "mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's house, it wasn't necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just American.
I'm speaking Spanish, good enough to get both sides of conversation in this language.
However, I have no words of a parental speaker, and I can't get out of America's emergency.
So I dropped my American pass and put me in the front for "Extranjeros".
I thought about the time this week the new mexican president Enrique Pena Neto visited the White House of President Obam.
The programme had general matters that are gathered when leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to talk about the growth of Mexico, which is one of the debts, why it is the same probability that Mexico will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to connect to the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Neto promised that he would continue in Mexico war against drug cards, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of enemy feelings.
Most Americans probably have never thought that the United States attacked Mexico in 1848 and brought his leaders to overwritten the half of the Mexico territory to the United States.
But for Mexico who think about the limits of centuries, not minutes, they are all of them.
So a minute after the representative of the United States says something just a little critical about Mexico, you hear in Mexico printing and between the elite complaint about how the Americans include their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezumy are on the war road.
Yet, for Mexico, there is a real challenge to more than 35 million Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about enemy feelings?
That's a lot.
In Mexico, there are victories and hurts, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexico roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that in some point of our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or a parent who had the opportunity to go north in Mexico.
And more frequently than it seems, this person corresponds to the profile - dark hair, weak education, poor of the poor village, etc.
We're their descendants, and we're loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we are living in America's dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget that we live American dream, not Mexico.
Our identity may sometimes be unexplained, but our loyalty is not.
It's about the United States.
Yet, we think that many elite Mexico people belong to the Governing Class does not have us.
This feeling is mutual.
It sees us as a humiliating hurt and looks at us as a subordinate race, which is not enough mexican.
Our Spanish never gets good enough, our visit to Mexico is never sufficiently strong.
Our existence is because of their opinion only about failure.
If our families weren't in Mexico, they would never leave her.
And now we have not been arrested for a huge opon, with a good life in the United States, but even with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajar and was legally approached to the United States, believes that there is an attempt between Mexico and Mexico Americans, because Mexico more understands who they are, and the Mexico Americans do not.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, it sees itself part of two countries.
And now many Mexico Americans who I know do not feel like part or one.
We love the listening to mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteena.
You get it best from both countries, but you don't have roots in one.
It looks like Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we are considered mexican.
And to more complicate relationships, some mexican leaders and part of the intellectual, as I learned when I went out, want to connect again to the diaspore.
They want mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent mexican interests in the United States.
They had to tell our American partners how beautiful it is to visit this country and to press political leaders to deal with the relationships with Mexico.
No.
So that's going to happen.
Too many enemy feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of receipts and a very extensive corruption and drug violence many of us are not certain that it is a great country.
I have a feeling like it's for you, friends.
That's fair.
At least some Mexico people are not ready to forgive the United States how they acted with Mexico ago and a half centuries ago, so they must accept that some American Mexico still feel new for the way they were associated with their family members in extremely closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexico" than I thought.
Old battles, new Near East
The end of the burning between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can sometimes be a permanent peace between Arabs and Jews on the Nearest East?
Another round of blood transfusion indicates that everyone such none is crazy.
A number of buildings had been changed in anxiety among the obscured unfair agreements about who started, murdered more than 140 Palestinians, the center of citizens, and six Israelites. And the first of the rackets of Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Brazilian metropole, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though it seems that the Israelites and the Palestinians have committed their old conflict, the Nearest East around them changes.
The Arab Jaro changed the old orders and the Palestinians and Israelites, whether they like it or not, are captured in a continuous chaos in the region.
Maybe that causes their fight to be even more bloody than ever before.
Yet, there are deeds to think that it can interrupt their death pattern.
War that is not even winned or lost.
The first view seems that there is no longer a lot of deal with optimism.
Even if the shutdown of the fire was held on November 21, the fights of this week would be forced by the bottles to both sides.
The leaders of Hamasa, the islamic movement, which is governed in Gaza since 2007, will claim that they have brought Israel to access, even though Gaza suffered a distress.
Despite murdering some of Hamas leaders and closing 1,7 million Gaza in one of the most worst and worst corners of the planet, the Israelites couldn't destroy Hamas.
And at the same time, Hamas has a effect on the Western March, the next cave of the Palestinian, which is currently managed by his arrested rivals from Fatahu, the more deadly Palestinian fraction.
Moreover, leaders of Hamas can very well bearing that time is on their side.
The Islamics throughout the Arab world had a greater influence, so Hamas gained strong and rich friends.
Turkey, the rebuilt regional power, which was ever the nearest Muslim associate of Israel, was added to Hamas, as well as Katar, one of the richest and dynamic countries in Zalivia.
Clear people from Hamas say that the Islamic half months around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the side/mile of Hizballah is governed, through Syria, where the rebels, who are still more clothing to islamism, can meet Bazara Asada, even after Jordan, where the associates of Hamas threaten the kings.
In particular, on the southern crowd of Israel, the Muslim Brothership has changed the rise under the leading President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, from the most popular and traveling Arab country, equality in the region.
Mr. Mubarak, the secondary depote, which was ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
Rather, Brothership is Hamas' brother and his leaders are more affecting public changes.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can appear as a player that cannot be destroyed by Israel or by America.
Rather, the Israelites will come to the reverse conclusions.
In military termology, Hamas was reloaded to bed.
Israel’s anti-raketic system The Iron Column proved its price, and many Hamas cancers were destroyed.
The Israelites can sleep better for a minute.
In diplomatic termology, America is the same inevitable as >. Many European countries also wined Hamas from the beginning of the last round of violence.
And mainly - Israel prospered, in particular under Benjamin Netanjahua, the president of the government, who ignored peace process.
Although the rackets from Gaza since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelites, in Israel was extremely calm from self-subductors, from the part of the wall that contains the wall, the main part of what Palestinian state may be, and protects the Jewish agencies that are still growing through their opposite to the international law.
The Prime Minister of Netanjahu, whose side of Likud at the beginning of the campaign to the elections of 22 January, has been connected to an even radical group conducted by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why do we disappoint those proud Palestinians by giving them their own state?
Would they actually rule on the West March, so they wouldn't burn rackets as their lands in Gaza did?
It's gonna be better if we'll keep them behind the wall, and we'll pull them out when he's cut off his heads.
Perhaps the guardians win strong lines, but the Arabian jaro can change their budgets.
Although islamics who get power in Egypt and other countries are not too loving Israel, their main priority will be to cope with home problems.
Israel’s expenditure for the defence are higher than all four of his four Arab neighbors in the garden.
The start of a new war with the local super-sufficiency force will help new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Mursy cooperated with President Barack Obamou to reach the stop of the bread is a good sign and it can mean the beginning of something new.
Similarly, the Israelites should look forward to the presentation.
At the time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates the oppression of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determine the court with the shoot work that one day has to explode in the occupied Israels - as the bus that was exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Repression is already increasing in the Jewish state of democracy and demography. This is still worse as the Arab population grows.
Blood waste against Gaza, which ends every few years after Hamasa's arrest, will still choose more diplomatic tax.
Both sides of the guests are worth it.
The answer is what understanding people report on both sides, the outer world and these newspapers: two states where Israel is in the area of security.
In a short-term view, there is a little to ́e that the stop of bread will give the pressure from the inside at least a little more influence on the processing of this thing.
Egypt, who with Turkey and Catherine has to determine the stop of the weapons delivery to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of the Jewish state based on the ships of 1967, with the exchange of parts of the country and the shared Jerusalem.
Arabs must also press to the meeting between Hamas and Fatahem.
This would do more than without the United Nations national sovereignty for the establishment of the Palestinian State.
The President Obama also has its part of how to get Israel to the acting table.
In his first election period, he refused to represent his own peaceful plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems to be the same impressive in its entrance in the process.
Oh, it's a little short.
America has a lifely important interest in the Stable Near East.
This means peaceful balance between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Law on Cigarettes was entered into force
On independent green boxes that are the same for all tape marks, warnings for boxes and sick parts of the body are shown.
The Australian laws on the severe tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their species in the world, and the logs and the colours of the marks replaced by generally green boxes with the images of the diseases of the body and the visualization of children and the newborn illness results of their parents.
Besides different health warnings and images, the only difference between label names that are printed by the same small letter is due to Sabbath.
It's the most precise regime in the world regarding the tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government claims that the goal is to deduce young people from the rain by delivering this crime of his attractiveness.
The study shows that if people don't start smoking up to 26 years, 99% of the chance is that they will never start smoking.
"And in very small children, you can see that they understand the message that the tobacco companies try to sell them together with their product," says the Federal Ministry of Health of Tanya Plibersek and other studies, for example, that children have shown that they are connecting a coronary in the dialogue with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of bullets in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the benefits of the overnational companies, other countries consider the introduction of adequate steps.
Tobacco's plan against the introduction of these laws was firmly lobby.
Tabak companies claimed that this law would increase the trade in the black market, which will lead to the left and more available cigarettes.
"Thank this legislation will come to serious unintentional followers," says Scott McIntyre from the British American Tobacco's company.
Padelants from China and Indonesia will bring many more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, small family companies, said that the request for cigarettes from the silicone service for the covering of the boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had lost their claims on the highest court of Australia.
Ha noted that Zico sold nearly 6000 kits to big business sellers and expected new resources.
It's a good business for us.
As a potential challenge, experts refer to the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
According to a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports tasks and requesting that the sellers cover cigarettes from direct view, the tobacco marketing moved on-line.
Australia has prohibited the internet advertising conducted by local companies and websites, but it cannot limit the websites.
"When you're a marketing worker in the tabak industry and remains only this small space for your products, you're online room in the place where you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the public health university in Sydney.
Ms. Freeman mentioned an increased evaluation of the labels on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by "small Honzou".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves the cigarettes of Marlboro and has given it a job and created this video, or is it a marketing company involved in it?
The British American Tobacco's company claims that the sector has focused on how it is putting up with new rules before marketing.
The sector has been so far that Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic have paid for the attack of new rules - the countries of the World Trade Organization are declared that trade is injustly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia is consideringly negotiated.
The exemption of the SOO Decision is expected in the middle of 2013.
Ministry Plibersek says that the government has conducted discussions with other governments who consider similar laws on packs.
Canada was the first country, which took the obligation of warning photos in 2001.
Today, more than 40 countries have been extended in Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The Great Britain, New Zealand, Jihoafia, and India are considered as a closer law.
There's a lot of shoes in Australia.
The pictures on me have no effect.
I just ignore them.
"But you're getting a cigarette and a box you're shooting from the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photograph of the box in the mouth.
Honestly, it's just one d'you to stop smoking, and it's my little daughter.
James Yu, whose own trading King of the Pack in the Sydney centre, says that thanks to the single boxes it is more difficult for him to equippe the rules.
"I've been costing one hour, now I have four hours," said Yu.
"The government should just prohibit them completely, and then they said, "Okay, that's the end, we'll shut them," he said and decided with his hands.
In the world of an unusual connection is not so bad to be disappointed
On the last day of thanks, I was unexpectedly spent five hours in the aircraft when we had our mechanical aircraft and we had to wait for the next aircraft.
So we had a lot of time to think about trouble.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting half day on the airport for the next years is nice, even though the distribution of books, magazines and iPhonem (not talking about duty-free trades).
But some doctors and experts for children's development are still increasingly added to the praise of the offer.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to offer sometimes.
It needs to go into interesting directions, which can help creativeness.
And because we are still connected to any screen today, we do not have the opportunity to use a hurt.
So they should have supported the offer?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
But I'll be back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that the nutrition is a very new evidence to which the arrival of more free time has occurred.
But as Peter Toohey says, the Greek and Roman History at the Canadian University in Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: And Lively History (History of Nude) (Yale ́ Press, 2011).
"Your abilities have noise of history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeach, there was a Latin signature regarding the nausea, which entered from the first century of our year.
And then it is also the question of how we define the nausea.
The difficulty is being defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology in York in Ontaria in Canada.
After looking at research and translating the ideas of a target group of approximately 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the nausea as a result, "I wanted to do something that would please me, but I was not able to."
The nutrition is different from the appetite that the person is not involved in anything, but she wants to be.
He says there's no use of an apatie to do something.
It says that the nutrition nuclear is "the deterioration of the attitude process associated with the wrong injury and the feeling of a quickly running time."
The nutrition can have much depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they could have a mutual relationship, they have tendances to see a problem like a rubber or a world, while people who are in depression see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're hurt, when we're just getting focused.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues showed the previous experiment in which the students listened to the footnote on which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a voice and unconscious television program in the neighborhood, others heard her so quietly that they just saw her, while the third group did not hear her.
Those who heard the television program of pokers reported more trouble than the last two groups -- they had a concentration, but they were not sure why and accepted these disorders.
When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or disturbable task, the disturbance of the attention to the nutrition can lead, Mark J. Fenska, a professor of uncertainty on the of Guelph in Ontariu and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something poor, "as looking for bad parts on the fabric line, the spreading music can help you not hurt."
At the same time, he said, now we know that through the clusters and the seeds, which often are viewed as a sign of trouble, it can help to fight and maintain people physically more careful.
"The investigation shows that children who have been allowed to return more learn and keep more information than those who are needed to sit in silence," Professor Fenska said.
We've been all survived at times -- the late of my year, the fucking player, especially a long movie.
But some ones have a greater chance to offer themselves than the end.
For help with the measurement of nutrition in the past 80s, they developed "Boredom Proneness Scale" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The pile includes questions such as, "Multiple things I have to do, repeat and is monotonal," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do."
With the help of these graduations, boys have the trends to offer more often than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor psychology in the West Florida, especially as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
However, teenagers are generally inevitable.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor for Human and Community Development for Illinois, conducted a experiment in which he contacted at least 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times daily.
He realized that 32 percent of adults were noticed that they were affected in school and in the work of home, while 23 percent indicated that they were hurt when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents indicated that they had been offered.
Professor Larson stated that he doesn't know whether the percent of the nutrition would be now, 21 years ago, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "adulting is an extreme time for nausea", which is in significant way caused by the children and young ones not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my question, "It's good for you?"
As the research shows, sometimes not, because in his extrémity, people can lead to a absurd physical risk, playing hazard games or disturbing the normal substances as a way to hurt it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between nutrition and creativeness, professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"The nuda is a way of brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor psychology in NYU.
But the brain doesn't know the most convenient thing you should do.
If you offer and use this energy to play on kytar and wallet, it will make you happy.
But when you look at the TV, it will make you happy for a while, not for a while.
So if your child is hurt and you give him iPad, it's already offered, but he doesn't learn how to enjoy or run himself, Professor Fenska said.
And "This self-process is transferred from one to another," the professor said.
Your child is not just learning how to enjoy himself, but getting more self - control in other ways.
I don't think we really want to celebrate anxiety.
But neither should they be too critical against her.
Our goal should be more satisfied when we are from the achievement of an inconsistent deterioration of activity and §.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We're excusing her to offer more, but the nutrition's painful, unfortunate desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are looking for, he said, is a way to release and enjoy free time.
"It's hard to find ways to enjoy when the sound is off."
There is no manual in Coloradu regarding the new law on marihuana
Ninety-year-old Anthony Orozco, a higher school student and Âbalist from South-East Colorada, claims the accusation of criminal acts for something that will soon be legal in the entire country - for the exhibition of some grams of marihuana and smoke that he used for her rain.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he took with a couple of friends in Lamar, at the boards near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the police officer found in the car of Marihuan, Mr. Orozco was issued a preliminary call for drugs and equipment for drug consumption - detailed crimes in which it is 100 USD - and was set to him the date of the court.
"They were hiding to us as the criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In recent weeks after the colouring vote on the legalization of a small quantity of marihuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the place of the right.
Hundreds of cases of crimes for marihuana-driving have already been canceled here and in Washington, who approved similar measures.
The police department stopped accusing adults in 21 years and the elderly of a small quantity, which will be legally allowed after the income of the latter weeks.
But the complaints in the most conservative areas of Colorada declared that they would continue with existing cases relating to marihuana, and they still accused people of being driving.
At the same time, several cities from Denver are voting towards the west mountains on the prohibition of opening new, licensed trade state with marihuana in their communities.
"That's the matter that I don't know what's going to happen," said Daniel J. Oates, police leader in Aurora, east from Denver.
Heavy heads and regulators in Washington.
And they are looking for instructions to set up the system of licence for planting, production, distribution and sales - all until the term of 1st of 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or bad, is before a decade of states in marihuana regulation, first for medical use and now and recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so he will be a good leader," said Brian E.
But as you admitted, no place or system can do more than to do what could work.
"There is no precedens which they could be conducted," he said.
The Washington Law, I-502, is available in the 6.°C, which also leaves an annual vaccine during which there is still a state license system, but a legal type of yes.
And there are noteworthy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, for example, how to export the Directive of the State concerning the "compliant access" to the licensed marihuana with its prohibition of trade with conopy to 330 metres from schools, parkings, children's sins or children's centres.
"Nowhere more difficult to place a licensed trade with cannabis than in the towns, especially in the metropolitical Seattle," said Ben Livingston, the speaker of the Legal Conope Centre, recently established research groups.
On November 21, the police officer Oates sent his e-mail officers from Aurora, where he announced them that the town's complaint had already been to deceive crimes for a small quantity of marihuanas at every 21 years older citizen, and that the police "with immediate validity" would stop the accusation of people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would pursue the town laws regulating the medical marihuana fishers and that they would continue to steal drug buyers and dealers.
In the period Weld in North Colorada, the periodic prosecutor Ken Buck represents a closer view.
After voting, he declared that his authority would continue to strike cases of marihuana treating, as a way to press the holders to seek treatment.
At the current time, there are 56 grams or less marihuana 119 people, even though many of them are accused of further accusations.
"Our office is required to disturb the criminal prosecution that was criminal at the time when it came to them," Mr. Buck said in his declaration.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the foreign period of Mesa, where electors refused the marihuan initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of a period that doesn't charge adults for a small amount.
The Periodic Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to refuse all the current cases of the trend.
"I don't think I'm losing my time by continuing to promote the rights until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of coloured electors have supported measures, the introduction of recreation marihuanas to the Government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the counterfeit reactions throughout the state have been discovered with regard to this large state-green experiment of deep divergence between local officers.
For periodic prosecutors, this is "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents an accusation of marihuana's trial, and the local speaker of the National Organization for the Reform of Marihuana laws.
"They had so much part of their life by shaking people that they could still not accept that it was legal," he said.
As the first states that have a small quantity of marihuanas as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are in the best way in national testing cases for the legalization of drugs.
Obligors and State authorities plan new borders for legalized sales, and at the same time are expected by the Federal Government, which is still in the plan to consider the sales and marihuanas for federal crimes.
Marihuana legalization authorities hope that the Ministry of Justice will approve.
Despite a few prisoners of marihuana sellers for medicals and patients who use it, which have reached attention, the federal government left trade with the medical marihuana in Colorada, Washington and other 16 countries in the operation.
While the anti-Drogen agents probably are going to put the door to catch a small drug sack, it is likely that they will be allowed by the State of regulated trades with recreation marihuana authorised by new laws, Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser in the anti-drogue policy of President Obama.
A number of colored cities does not expect the procedure of federal authorities.
Before the election day, some local governments have approved the moratorium of any new trade with marihuana, even if it will take it for a year before any trade is opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose on the west of the state has occurred a half-year prohibition and is probably the next week will enter into force.
"We don't want to feel feeling when we give a license to someone and then we'll have a great federal matter," said Bob Nicholson, member of the city Council.
Our neighbor voted against this.
We're looking at what she voted for, forgiving what he refused to be.
There's a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was invited to get out of Oxford because I'm a conservator."
They have not only been attacked by university students today.
I don't remember that I'd ever hate study at Oxford University.
Like my father, so my elder brother studied at the university, which I thought it was the biggest world seat of selfishness, modern greek ovine symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thoughts and tolerants.
And then, at the end of the 80th century to two weeks after I went to Worcester College, where I wanted to study the story, I packed the cookies and returned to the first scandal of my life.
My father was wounded and wept.
My friends were killed.
The journal Evening Standard claimed that I gave it because I had a match against the love of students in the neighborhood room.
The writer A. N. Wilson told me that I was gone because I was needed to drink out of the wounds.
The truth was less comic.
I'm running.
Yeah, I fled because I was the subject of systematic shaking and fearing.
Not because of my kind of bizarre name or responsibility that I came from my private school.
I was investigated from the only debt and in this collection of imaginary lighting it was like biform, so barbaric: my father, the whispered Woodrow Wyatt, was highly established by Margaret Thatcher's adviser and I was the prosecutor of Conservati and the sides.
You can ask why I'm getting out of it right now.
Only because the last reports indicate that a new generation of students suffers from the middle by similar investigation.
The institutionalized and growing hatred to conservate students in Oxford is so big that a group of these students has been in the same protection of equal rights as gay, health position and ethnic minorities last week.
Conservates: members of the Juvenile Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College state that, due to their political views, they are "frequently actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and it is shown to them that they are not welcome."
They request the creation of positions in the University Committee for equal opportunities that would ensure that their opinions can be freely communicated.
They did not even help the recent documentary order of the BBC Two television with the name Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Shardk country: Young, Intelligent and Right) about the student political action that the conservator has been counted as an insults and neonacists.
In the order, the ex-president Oxford ́ Conservative ́tion (conservati ́ the Oxford University University - OUCA), which led Rolls-Royc, was dressed in silver clothes and had a cow with silver head.
In other high schools, students say that they have been conceived with the introduction of a higher school as with the "offers sheep".
Twenty-year Luke Black, vice-president Nottingham日 Conservative ̈tion (conservati ́association of Nottingham's university), said to the Sunday journal that "living impact on universities grows.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club, not to meet us."
The 11-year student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement of more protection, says that such climate is "inappropriate", while the ninety-year-old president OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the approach of the JCR members to people from the middle of the middle of the destruction.
"This represents a threat to the atmosphere of the intellectual debate, as well as for the good life submins of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minor of one member.
I went in September 1986, 18 years old and protectively.
Hate against Conservati was the worst side.
In a year ago, the university refused to give an honorable title to the former student Margaret Thatcher from the ships in the financing of high school.
The atmosphere would also be afraid of the stalinists.
During the first few days of the introduction week, when new students are related to themselves and with the professional, I got to want a pell to come.
I tried that not only the Professors of the milk accept the burning of conservative bags, but also with silence.
In the tree of the listeners, the policy of horn stages, privatization and the opposition of the government against sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic was introduced.
My first advice was about the translation of French text from the 18th century to England and I was not ready for what followed.
"Mrs. Wyatt," Professor Harry Pitt said, "but please add the first paragraph."
I've got a lot of fucking fucking.
Professor Pitt, a little man with his face as a cockpit, was very jealous.
"Thatcherovs refuse to learn French, or they're just stupid?" He asked.
Other students went away.
I've got the laughs in my eyes.
"I'm supposed to take a basic French lesson in your free time, so if you're not too concerned about Community matters," rejected Professor Pitt.
I was fucked back to my room.
At the school evening, I was sitting alone when I felt easy to slip on my brain.
He was a student of the second year named James, who represented himself as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," said he quietly.
Unfortunately.
Everyone who's understood of the conservation is the same.
It's good enough for me, but they think your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Most conservative elements suggest that they are aware.
After the local economy, I was trying to try to get out.
I held that I didn't agree with all that Thatcher said.
This trick appeared as a failure.
Student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economy, who walked to Eton, said, "You're the daughter of the fascist purse."
You're hurt.
Other students were noted with him.
I was crazy, sorrowful.
"How do conservators love?" asked one.
He's crying one another, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before liberal legislation of sixty years.
Could I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be required to meet those like thinking people just after a conviction?
Should I have to change in the art and strike my natural skin?
Three years before me were developed as a cleaner of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservated professor was Norman Stone, a modern history professor who sat on my school.
He was hated not only because he was preserved, but even because he was Margaret Thatcher's adviser for the political policy and one of those who write their words.
It wasn't almost there.
This place he hated for his provincy and maligeness and for his access to the marxistick-determinist view of the history.
In 1997, he was a professor at the Bilkent University in the Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started going from Oxford to my parents' home in London, looking for an attachment to my unexpected metropolitical friends and families.
I told fathers I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe that.
During his study at Oxford in the fourteen years, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," said the patetic.
They wouldn't do that, not sleeping in the city.
Even my communist friends had perfect ways.
His lower eyes were ashamed.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a jacket.
It would break my heart if you'd go.
My emotional distress was deteriorated by a frequency flying to London.
My friend, also the recipient Conservate by the party, put the pressure and rejected his conviction.
The next week in the course of learning, when another professor of history in absolute seriousity declared that I am an enemy of people, I decided to do the same.
Though I was inside the red stuff, I admitted that my parents had a brain and I called them "an old fools."
The leaf was just a little short.
My oxford carrier's cut off my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week in Murdoch's news.
My doors were closed.
I got inside, and after five minutes my investigators left it.
When they left, I got the coffee and took the first street to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dark weak.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be in the educational establishment subject to such fear and food.
Yet, it was more tragic that Oxford, from which 14 conservative premises were not only taken, but also hiding for an unworthy story of places with equality and free thoughts to this day.
"Valentino's able to be electants than slave."
In the event of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of modern creation", which was started this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fionou Thyssen-Bornemiss and other famous customers of the Italian Guardian.
Somerset House, an ancient residence in Isabela I.Øllica, is the only place in the British main town nice to visit the exhibition of Valentina Garavaniho.
The composer confirmed this when starting the famous retrospective "Valentino: Master of Mode Creation", which represents more than 130 models of top mode created by his atelier in the last 50 years.
"I love this lock," he says with his inevitable Italian advice.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the story in which "Il Mr" Garavani is the only protagonist, which could not be written without his honest customer.
Valentino felt awake by a rare and remote world of aristocracy.
Princess Salimy Aga Chán through the Greek princess Marii-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal spectacles as the trophes of his community resort: from a simple circle from the city of Vogera north Italy to a idol of the international "Good smethans".
Having the king's family is nothing wrong.
"They're at least unbeached cigarettes in a great cover, as they do some beautiful pop-music celebrities," says the Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in Al·ch and were good friends.
Valentino is an effective host, and hosts enjoy a lot and with elegancy.
"All of us were very comfortable when we were invited to his chat in Gstaadu," explains the ex wife "Heini's" Thyssena and the nearby friends of forgotten beauty like Marella Agitéi or Eugeni Niarchos.
"Valentino had a ra's ra's electant than the glory.
And so is the star."
Valeria Mazzova leader Valentina
The charism doesn't deal with the argentin model Valeria Mazzova.
"It's already a year that we went to him for dinner after one watchman in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were twenty and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger among us.
In every goodness of his apartment, his devotion, his eating, his music, in all things, he went down and felt his spirit.
All invitations to him could feel important and love," takes the top model that began to work with him during the Paris week in 1995.
"He's never going out of the mode, because his neighbors are artificial works," he's sadged.
Family Preview
The gravean life is not a story of injury, but truly the genuine love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House gallery was stopped at a personally seventy meters of passport, which offers a role exchange: visition changes to a model and comes from passports to watch "communication" of dreams that Valentinov's master works as clothes chosen by Jackie Kennedy at his wedding with Aristotel Onassis, a bone that had Monica Vitti in "Night", or a cab from the wheat and the skin that belonged to Caesar Farah Diba.
In the magazine, the manic is named Sibilla Lucemburska, Gloria from Thurna and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norska, Rosario Bulharska or So日 Habsburska.
Natas Abascal, and the author in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is as the first love, "not forget."
"I'm able to do that.
It was a bullet, a bullet, a bullet, and a bullet from the assembly of the sub-zime from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," Naty Abascal says, one of the muscles.
"I give him the final privilege of his femaleness and great love for women because he supports our beautifulness," adds the former leadership from Feria.
"I like the colors that he uses, explains much and gives the face "screen".
Proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and mode icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how you first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and lived in Italy, she was trying to be full-year and have the opportunity to dress one of his dinner shoes...
Finally, she was expected at the end of the 90s.
"I bought my first clothes from Valentine for the opportunity of celebration at my brothership, prince Edouard de Line.
It was the red clothes that had to be cut with the calls, the crazy animals and the top without the border.
It was a dream that became awesome," says the widow after Rodrigu d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is laxed to mode, his wheat is overtime," explains the Italian aristocratic, whose life is divorced between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has been placed in the celebration of the celebration clothes "very carefully... because clothes are not just clothes, it's also a file of an appeal that has in itself."
"Key" Mode
The golden cup of exhibition in Somerset House are Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
For the creation of these rubbers of slonovine colors with all the perles, twelve types of different parts and five and half meters were required for four months of work and 25 "children" (as called the chairman of his wooden).
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest of specialized printing authorities, represent these clothes of the top mode of the end of the 20th century, "return a client from the high company".
Valentino is now his best example throughout the year of the "savoir-ster" elite.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest nomination in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and designed by the Order of Honest legies as well as any of his customers.
"My attention touched his choice, calm, adjusted and perfect view," admits princess d'Arenberg.
"I've seen him a month ago on a dinner gala in the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was unfair, the time left no stop on him."
When the princess says that...
The strongest part of the world: wearing sire in the sopka Kawah Ijen
After four euros, wearers indones with their lives and health are risked when wearing 70 kilograms of seeds down on slow stone roads.
There are people for whom their work is a peculiar, and they are those who are in the hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 hills, who make it to live in the lives of Sire from Kawah Ien on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
That is why every day the fabric to the bottom of the corner, where they avoid severe gases from the inside of the Earth, and when the air is contacted, it has to go into a solid state.
After exhausting big seed blocks, which are worth up to 70 kilos, it refers to the branch in two bambus boxes on the cockpits of stone roads.
To the top of the soap that is 2 386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but the exhausted nose takes over 40 minutes before they go up with the iron template because they maintain the equality and reflect their steps in order to not closing and not get to fall.
They know that any adversity could be a life like a French tourist who was born from Kawah Ijen scale ago.
Hornizi in Kawah Ijen produces five cents for each kilo of sire that wins
When they are upward, the road around tourists that photograph them like ops in the cycle, and they are very hard to the weight that the low company placed on something below, at the oversea height of 1850 meters.
It's the company PT Candi Ngrimb, who has never paid his employees more than 662 Indonesian Rupies (5 cents) for a kilo of sire.
Then he sells it for 10 000 rupies (83 cents) to petrochemical industrial, because this nerve has its place in every day and is used for the production of burning, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamics, and even for sugar whiteness.
"Because we're wearing 70 kilos, we'll make about 46,000 rupies (3,8 euros) for every road," Anto explains us, which usually resolves three roads daily.
One road takes three hours and finally is destroyed, but it can produce 138 000 rupies (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems to be an insufficient amount for such an unsuccessful effort, it's threefold of what he would do in the field.
"The day of hours is very high here. For example, for a collection of coffee, 15,000 rupes (1,2 euros) per day and paid for fourteen days are two million rupias (167 euros)," explains the nose that was previously working on the Bali Island as a wall.
There was 75,000 rupies (6,2 euros) for day and work was not so hard, but Anto returned to his family to Banyuwangi, the village near the soup, from a serious debt that is in Indonesia equally convinced as sira: "I married with a young girl from Bali, who is hinduist, and I took her to Java to convert to islam."
Anto has astma, he's badly breathing, he's still cool and his eyes's coated toxic gases
In its 27s, Anto risks life three times daily in Kawah Ijen soap, whose grain has already started to choose his tax, although his face is protected by special mass and brilliants.
He's astma, he's badly breathing, he's still throat, and his eyes's adequate toxic gas that avoids the soaps.
That's the price he needs to pay for to get his dream.
"I'm gonna work for two years, because I want to open business or study Spanish or French," he promises more than obsessive English.
This sympathic and intellectual young man who is invoked by judgment could be a tourist, a teacher or a receptor at the hotel, and instead he works the weaker.
He shares a spine tree chatch with other wearers and each day rises in two hours, because the sire doesn't stop crewing and its characteristics of yellow color changes into blue and dark darkness.
Even in the surrounding darkness of Anto in the corner, it lights a little light road that he's stuck on the helma and bought it for his money.
Approximately 400 weapons make up on the back of the cartridge with a seed from the bottom of the cartridge
Although the company has high income, the weight of the greenhouse has not mechanized or does not provide the nose workers for their own plants and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, there is no part of 30 000 rupes (2.5 euros) of the photographing supplies, which together with 15.000 rupes (1.2 euros) chooses of natural park guards from tourists who come to photograph their soap and its human mules.
"That's the job for the resources, not for people," urges Madrusin, a 42-year-old nose who works in Kawah Ien for three decades, since he left school.
He will be able to take up 110 kilos and make us sure he's keeping working, "when far it's going," because he's got money for his three sons in the middle of 18 to 10 years.
I'm not going to the road, I'm gonna die here because the soap was my whole life.
Although the grass burns bitterness and scarlets in the eyes when the wind turns unexpectedly and swallows horns in the woods, the winds are so strong that no one of them suffers serious illnesses... but it is obvious of their frequent respiratory heat, arthroses, knees, and ran on the brass caused by the wallets.
The unit that considers his bag on his backs may have only 50 kilos in his 53 years.
Each day, he and his colleagues produce 15 tonnes of sire, which then three trucks carry out the street road between the towns in Tamansari, a distance of 18 miles [18 km].
"I'm not going to the road, I'm going to die here because the soap was my whole life," says Uninik, and then opens the width of the mouth in which a few teeth miss.
From his five sons, the elderst, thirty-year-old, he also produces the depth of syringe.
The time goes, but the constant distress of one of the most difficult parts of the world survives from generations - the terms that will execute human mullas in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore shakes a girl to save the economy
Singapores do not have children, on career, stress, and costs for living and education.
"Inhabitants of Singapore grow."
I'm married, and I'm owner, you're my wife and you're owner.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is a part of the advertising of the menthole bonbons, but, however, - or maybe just because, the video has been spread massively at YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
These are parts of the rape, which uses local instructions of the type "We give a box in the troube" as a smile of birth measure in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, who created a video, hopes that this advertising will be able to warn them on a wonderful way.
The Artist Director of the Agency Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the effect of music for people to fulfil their "civic obligation".
"It is extremely interested in the Internet, so it must have been funny and funny.
It's the biggest problem of this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that it's the subject we need to touch.
We knew the government was trying to broadcast a lot of things as to spread the feromon parfums or organize the listing party.
Many of these ideas could be creative, but not completely lucky.
So we thought why not do the most creative thing of my thing like the raps, and they've solved this problem."
1.2 Children
Whoever doesn't take it too easy to weight is a Singapore government.
It will annually charge 1.300 USD to encourage citizens to have more children.
The Governing Package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 for a child, extends the mother's allowance and adds financial doses.
All these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with a growth in Southeast Asia, also known by the conservacy of its representatives and the cruel social controls.
The measure of birth in Singapore as regards the distribution of the population is currently 1,2 children for women.
Consequently, the ratio of the value 2, which is considered as a renewal measure in 1976.
Why do the Singapurs actually have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, manager of the Body of Marriage and the National Agency's family, says that it is because of "better education" and "which is the kariary opportunity scale".
"The people so have a larger scale of opportunities about life's goals and priorities, it is not only marriage and family," explains.
These changes in Community standards have contributed to increase the number of free people and to decrease maritality and children's growth.
While in the immigration policy, the effort was to increase the impact of immigrants as measures against the decreasing of the population, it caused a disaster among local residents.
On some Singapore web sites, there is an uncovered xenofobie against many new promotors, especially the Chinese who are criticized for maintaining low payments and a little effort to integrate.
Increasing immigration is also assumed as one of the deficiencies, why the Governing Party of Singapore has mentioned its worst electoral outcome from the beginning of independence.
After elections, a problem has been opened to solve by means of quota and higher payments for jobs.
Unexpected followers
During the reduction of birth, the national economic growth, tax income, health expenditure and immigration policy has been known, and in the case of Singapore, there were certain unexpected results.
The government's trying to build so many small homes.
She, for example, began to affect the necessary trade.
The Civil Development Authority began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "both boxes" which can be built in certain cities.
These apartments have a range of 46 metres of quarter and have great success in sale.
However, it is concerned that these habitats can support young life and reflect developments in order to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, the general director of the developer company EL 日ers, states that their "both boxes" are selling far more than houses.
"They're more aware, so they're selling for days to weeks than houses with more divorce.
That's why our money flow is much better."
However, it recommends that new standards set up clearer rules to developers who were previously limited to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could lead to increase the nature of the nation's generation, the discussion of Singapore workers in the financial quarter of the city in the center indicates that they have a great effect.
"The people are still in stress, the houses are dear, the same as education, so many people dismiss it," says the young officer.
"Let the others have a child.
But it's important for me to share your own money and time," says another, about twenty years old, young man.
Men and women mention the career, stress, and costs of living and education as a dây that prevents children from having.
So if the government tries to make the citizens anything to make children, it's the same end of the Singapurs who have the last word about the establishment of the family.
What is private offline is private and online
Privately.
According to the dictionary issued by the Spanish Academy, there is something that has a personal attitude or "the area of the private life which every right has to protect against any violation".
What is the privacy for a 16-year-old man?
How does this definition apply in its daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the danger that it is exposed to when he publishs the matters that he would certainly not tell anyone in the running communication?
The journalists from elPeriódico have spoken about five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years of age who are often online.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "the whole of the own" in the private area and as "username and password" in relation to the social network.
"My greatest secret I would not publish," says the decades of Jorge in trying to explain the importance of the privacy in places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has been for two years.
"They're a very secret secret, my mother can handle them, but not the whole world," he says.
"On the FBI, I'm giving nice or nice to play.
I'm talking to those known there too.
I wouldn't share a thing that wouldn't be my, or a cup that would smile someone," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish an obscenal photograph, photography of persons or pictures of crimes, or to write a humiliating or cruel comment.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends on the FBI and his nine clients on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
There's between them and a mother who has a name and a password of one of them.
"I put it on Twitter so that I could express my opinions and write interesting contributions.
I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just giving it there," he adds.
"Social networks are funny, I can talk to families who are far or have to communicate with friends," he says.
Without weight, he says he would never receive a request from an unknown person.
It wouldn't be interested in him if anyone recommended him someone unknown.
The case of a 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager own features on the Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask network and at the last mentioned network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I have no fear because we have something common, for example music," he says.
According to this boy, no one of them had to do anything, nor wanted him a address or number of the phone.
"If they'd call me or ask me that, I'll just remove them from their own," he admits.
José logged in to Ask after he read the recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is not a strange experience with what is now called cyberbullying (cyberchikana).
"The known friends have been driven to the social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was," he confirmed.
The victim doesn't refer to Joseph.
"It's just activated a private regime."
Then it explains a series of steps to keep safe.
In the case of Jorge, this boy would publish the numbers of known in inappropriate or angry events.
"Of course I'd do it if someone would call me or would just want me.
Even if I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, the artist of the English and the abspenditure of Vögo's campaign and learning, is that children and adults in social networks will have to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
It states, "Internet has come up as a lock to search for information, but when the social network has appeared, the game rules have changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that the academic worker Marc Prensky, the absolute pedagogic at the Yale University and the author of the article Digital Homer and Digital Promotors, introduced these ideas to explain this phenomenon.
"The digital households are children and young people who were born at the time of this section.
We're digital promotors that we have to do, and then we're just teaching ourselves," he says.
It explains that it's about a complex topic, "for we ask them to disclose what is appropriate to broadcast, publish and say, and what, however, not, when they are not yet growing."
In addition, to be - what is about the surroundings - reasonable, at the time when the most of what he wants is to be favorite, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the results," he adds.
According to this specialist, it is the most effective way for children and adults to show what it is private, to ask questions to think.
"Tell them to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Moreover, Marrielos Porras' names some of the options: are things you wouldn't tell for a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, would it be that you would like any man to publish you as you published the friend?
You know what the finals publish about you?
When you're labeling persons in the feast, you asked these people for authorization?
And another: Everyone needs to keep thinking what you're doing?
Another point is to realize that they have to keep the Internet at the same way as outside.
They're the same rules.
"The man outside the Internet is driving respect, moral and other principles, and the same should be on social networks," he says.
Overview
Estuardo Guardia, University Professor, Factor of the first degree and Education Advisor explains that it is necessary for parents to read social network rules carefully.
"When they understand every matter, they have a good basis to talk to them with children about the experiences that can be found on the Internet.
For example, what is about or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is the opinion that it is key to the children's traditional rule "not talking to strangers".
Summit South America ends and Lima declaration has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South America (Unasur) made in Peru today, without being issued a declaration from Lima, which was advertised and which was evidently signed by seven present presidents.
The Ephesian Agency tried repeatedly to get access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the United States head and government, but the representatives of the Ministerial office, who at the beginning determined that the document was published after the summit, noted that it would be published later on the Peruan Government's websites.
The content was published by the Peruan President Ollanta Humalu in some short print statements.
The journalists had limited access to information during the total summit.
During negotiations, videos from the presidential storage were transferred to the print room without sound with the message "Free meeting, sound transfer".
The small amount of information available to journalists was welcomed by pressing speakers of some governments who were present, however, not to Peruan speakers.
The only document published during the negotiation was a list of presidents, which called a new hundred newspapers from different national and international media that requested more information.
Later, the Peruan presidential office sent the media email with the "certain declaration" of the summit, but it is only the exhibition of President Humaly, not the official document that the summit closed.
Last October, the third summit of the South America and Arab countries (America del Sur-Países Arabs, ASPA) of Peru was not published, even at this occasion, the promised declaration from Lima, although printing was bitterly required.
On the Official Pages of ASPA, the document has been published in the past attack.
At both international meetings, the Peruan authorities were endeavored to ensure sending for all journalists, but completely dismissed information.
Summit ended outside the other common commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court, which resolves the dispute of the border between both countries.
The President of Peru Ollanta Humala and Chairman of Chile Sebastián Piñera have meet during the regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in Haag, which on Monday will continue to listen to the dispute of both parties to negotiate the dispute that Lima started against Santiago.
"We'll take up and make a judgment that will resolve the dispute we negotiate today at this international court," President Humala said together with his Chile Prothway.
"Chile was, they were, and the country would be respecting the international law, the peaceful solution of violations, contracts and international courts," Piñer added and welcomed President Humala by pressing his hands on the influence of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents of the decision of the International Court was published after that Columbia adopted this week the Bogot Pacific, which made details with the judgments of the International Court decided on maritime conditions with Nikaragua, and Columbia considered this decision to be completely wrong.
Summit was a channel without the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was removed from the Organization of Unsur in 2011 after the revocation of the President Fernand Luga and the meeting did not participate.
The host president Ollanta Humala was confirmed by the start of vulnerable words and the summit in Lima shortly after the south.
The President read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and planned for 31 projects between South America, with investments in $17 billion.
In addition to the agreed agreements, the Member States of the UNASUR organization have made "important steps towards the objectives of the South America citizen to which the residence agreements are extended".
He informed that measures are supported to improve "cooperation against civil disaster and internationally organized crimes, to improve the availability of medicines and the Internet in all corners of South America and to common and joint measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) has no victory base, but it must serve to expand our productivity and to show our people a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to predict a group of 31 symbolic projects that improve the transport of different places of South America, especially foreign and competitive places... that our countries should be better connected and create new economic links," said the Peruan President.
He changed that five of these projects were related to Peru and its big axes from the surface to Brazil, and the other two are related to better connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched the political responsibility in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve to return to the Union of South American nations," which is currently removed.
Another issue that the summit raised was the need for Latin America to remain prosperous and peaceful, which is celestial and has good neighbourhood relationships.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his regional meeting that he hoped that the Sabbath in Mexico he met his Nicaragua Prothia Daniel Ortego, in order to deal with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the dispute of the maritime border, which is doubted by God.
"It is likely to meet President Daniel Ortegos tomorrow (today)," said Santos.
"We negotiate all the solutions, no one has been excluded or with Nikaragu, which would require negotiations with this country," he said.
"I hope I will be able to say to the President of Ortegos, and the negotiations have conducted the most civilised and unexpectedly in my form," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega meeting the Sabbath in Mexico, where they are able to participate in the dark president of Enrique Penñi Niety.
In the summit, the EU Ministers of Defence met to adopt the Action Plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in defence matters.
The members of the UNASUR organization are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay, although the last country referred to is currently expelled.
Peru is the provisional president of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must be integrated from Europe
The Ecuador President Rafael Correa has noted today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must be made of Europe".
Corree, who was established by the sixth presidential summit of the Jihoamerican Union (UNasur) in Lima, announced in the State TV Peru that the Europeans were "smorded for the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one government".
In this regard, the draft creation of a South America citizen supported by the Member States of the Organization of Unsur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South America country, which already lives between the members of the Andes Community, is still available from the responsibility that wants us to return to the past," he warned.
On the other hand, the Ecuador President stated that they agreed with the overgroup of the United States Organization (OAS) under the undermining that the influence of the English States would be reduced and that those signed the Pact of San José on Human Rights will be taken.
"They who are in the head are never committed to anything, and we're the South Americas, however, signing all.
It is incomprehensible that the Interame’s Commission for Human Rights is financed in Washington by the United States," he introduced in the decree of political asylum by the Ecuador of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that this decision was not aware because he did not give up his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time " there was a detailed doubt that Assange could be issued to the third country without a view to the current process".
Furthermore, he criticized the Swedish Justice, which requested him to vote on the Swedish territory because of a given sexual delicity, while "the own Swedish legislation allows the votes of the videoconferencing talk that could be experienced from the equadoral welfare in London".
Correa noted that there was a risk that Assange would occur to a deterioration of physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken with him since a moment that is on our gloriousness, but she was very proud to inform me that she had a small flat, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of the State.
"It's worried that his physical and mental condition is worse because it's closed on the small space without the possibility of movement on fresh air.
That would not be the health of everyone," he added.
The President Corree noted that the solution of the asylum of Assange from June on the Ecuador Ecuadority in London on the basis of an authorisation that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hand of the Great Britain, Sweden and European Courts, and highlighted that the discussions had been held with London for the solution to the arrest of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We are not negotiating human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but have continued to be discussed.
The solution to this problem is in the hand of the Great Britain, Sweden and European Courts, because the lawyer of Baltazar Garzón has a series of management in various European institutions," he changed.
He said, "When the Great British releases tomorrow, everything will end."
And if Sweden, Mr. Assange, listens to the equatorial diligence in London or through Skype, how this allows dark legislation without a problem and how it has been done in other cases, this problem will be ended tomorrow."
Correa used this ability to present himself as a defense of freedom of printing, and explained that he determined not tolerated "protection, wrong intentions and lies that undercast freedom of expression".
We are not the biggest enemies of free printing, we are not politicians, and we are politics, but bad journalists in the service of benefits, pressures and distress," he said.
In this regard, he was glad that neither such journalists, nor bankiers, nor hegemon countries, nor burgeases control Ecuador, and suggested that if it is selected again, "the changes will be continued by the right path and the right direction."
The President Corree also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto of Paraguay on the membership of the Union in Unsur at least in its next elections and argumented that "the whole must be strong and untolerable opportunism and puchism attached to legality", since "the legitimity of the Paraguay Democracy" in particular.
In addition, the Ecuador Chairman stated that he considers "the absolutely appropriate" desires of his Colombian prosecutor Juana Manuel Santose to negotiate with Nikaragua on maritime relations between both countries now, at the time of the judgment of the International Court of Justice in Haag, which decided in the benefit of Nikaraguy.
The judgment is currently not accepted.
"It's a problem between the Southeast and the Mediterranean.
The conflicts are inexcusable, but the will must be convinced to run together.
It must be judged by the width to be convinced and it was the opportunity to go forward."
Moreover, he also expressed up in the comparison of a dispute on the sea border that resolves at the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the opinion that "the Latin America is right to search for a international institution, if both countries are concerned to adopt a judgment, whether he is strong."
With regard to the possibility of candidating in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to take the order for the third mandate, he noted that he had this option "with great optimism and happiness, even though it was sometimes very difficult".
Correa declared that if the election is lost in February 2013, it will leave from public life.
"I have never been interested in the power, but so unfair ability, such as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador, can only be acquired of political power.
My political movement believed that I am the one who guarantees this probably victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
"When I win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave the policy.
When we lose, it's waiting for me too.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also changed the new health treatment of the Venezuelan President Huga Chaveze in Cuba.
"I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Madur, who says that President Chavez went to the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
It's not about the residue of the President's health status," he explained.
The head of the Ecuador State has now participated in the sixth sum of the State head and the Governments of the Union of South America (UNASUR), which was regulated by the challenges of regional integration for the deterioration of development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are the final diagnosis today.
Fabrisi was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like a bleeding in me," he states at the springs on the moment of the truth that the doctor tried to "smell a little", but apparently without success.
The boy secreted it before the family.
He decided to take his sickness on his bed and began to inform her about, and it was with a seed that he had celebrated the 43th birthday.
It is certainly one of the latest patients of HIV in the Civil disease in Guadalajar (HCG), which came in 1994 after some disease threats.
Fabrizio lives with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unrepresentable at the beginning of the 90s, when there was a lot of doubts, a few possibilities of treatment and more stigma.
Then neither the manager of the Mexico Clinic of the Social Security Institute (IMSS) with him did not answer, "for he had a disgust."
At that time, AIDS was a synonym of death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live full-valuable.
However, there are many people who don't know and admire their disease until the virus caused the body to distort and send an immune system, and then they are victims of appropriate infections.
31 years since AIDS disease has occurred in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "the great success that the life of a patient who is at times and appropriately treated is totally the same as in healthy people," Jaime Andrade Villanueva, leader of HIV in the Civil hospital in Guadalajar, said that this information was confirmed in April of the year in the prestigious publication.
HIV/AIDS infection and specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that aids have concluded that since 2008 is not a death judge, but that the length of survival and full-valuable life depends on the degree of the immunity system of patients who are infected, whereas they are better on those who do not deserve drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and 500 cells CD4 to 50 years.
It is simply said that the one who has been HIV in 25 years can, according to these notices, "with the maintenance of treatment, live without problems to 75 years," explained the doctor in the discussion.
To illustrate this progress, it is appropriate to note that the meaning of Mexico's life is now 76 years old.
Although death was significantly decreased in recent years, and in case of Mexico, a number of people who died in AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the United Nations Aids Common Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that the AIDS was destroyed in accordance with national 60% of patients.
Only in the state of Jalisco, 255 persons died in 2011 and until May 187. However, since 2005, the universal access to antiretrovirus has been guaranteed.
- Why do people still die for sickness?
- "I think the problem isn't in the options of access to treatment.
That's what I see, so it's in the hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we haven't discovered the treatment resources. The problem is that patients are coming in a very progressive stage because they don't know the status of orders, or in the latest phase of disease."
It adds convinced data: "9 of the ten patients comes when an associated infection already appears. Only what is needed to do, and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In his opinion, specialists and officers of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to leave tests to the private laborer only because he did this by his friend, and even through his low low illness of AIDS, and also suffered by Caposi's sarcom, an accidental illness, which is one of the habitual complexities.
"All will change if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're dead, and they don't want to do anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'm trying to go three times a week," they say, "but that's not my case.
The change was better, healthy, usually, take medicines."
His parents do not know that he suffered a cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activity, my journey, I have a active sexual life, but responsiblely, I take attention to myself and to another person," Fabrizio, who has accepted a call to share his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISCO to motivate his witness today in the World Day of AIDS to those who fear.
"Let tests be done, if they risked, if they know what they're first, it's better, and if they've already been able to know that they can live as anyone else when they're responsible."
This message retains the password of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Desktop Condomes
Intermediately, there is a big disaster between health and remote citizens, Ricardo Salazar, a guadalajar journalist who finds information about HIV virus.
And the biggest areas are in prevention.
In the places that this job is "the increased distribution of condoms, one or two given us before, it gives us today packages and hundreds of condoms, which are very good, but there are still people who do not have access to the condoms," he introduced.
Among the most significant to new orders are adults.
"What do you want?" The current question is full of ironie and an examination from social workers, school advisers, doctors and health staff, who are wanting to avoid, says the reporter.
He proposed this ineffective division to change. The condoms are not only behind the rounds, but the hundreds are located in the dozens on public stations, in places where young people often walk.
"This is not a support for promiscuity.
It doesn't even "pay a beer and a motel", how Emilio González responded to the question whether he would agree with the distribution of preservatives during his period.
It's the best to access the condoms to those who have already conducted sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco State
13 435 cases (12 158 AIDS cases and 1 317 HIV cases).
This state means the fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13 places in relation to HIV.
92% of the order runs through sexual road, 6% by the road and 2% perimeterly.
It is considered that HIV virus can live about 50 thousand people, because for one registered case there are four to five persons who do not know about illness.
The sentence approved by the court of the United States, which does not recognize the restructuring of the debt of the Group Vitro negotiator in Mexico, calls for any national business with residents in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It seems therefore that the procedures of restructuring by fires that allow mexican laws are not paid in countries and stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of the sentence issued on June 15 of the past year by judge Harline Halem at the North Texas Court of Justice leaves mexican company in practice without defense against the possibility of confiscating their owner on the second side of the El Bravo river.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexico producer the door to the Supreme Court of the United States with a revocation against three inequalities.
The introduction is to say that while the judge of this cause claims that the credentials have to be executed by the law of the United States, the Revocation of the Court of Friday with the seat in New Orleans says that the main procedure sets the competitive procedure in Mexico.
Firstly, this would show the ignorance of international processing cooperation in the cases of transnational enterprises.
In the basic case, a model law of the United Nations for the combination of international trade law, which is designed by arbitrary by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without voting on the intern business structure, when the debt of Vitro's mother company was recognized, the requested restructuring would not be achieved without voting.
However, this option is admitted by Mexico laws.
The case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There is a half of these examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexico, for which the Federal Competition Institute has handed for their premises.
Furthermore, it is true that even after the discharge of the votes, the believers would stand against Vitro's company against the court in the United States, such as the "sups" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - have not reached.
The vote would reach approximately 45 per cent to 37.
This data does not take the Court of Justice in the road.
From another core of the victory of the Vitro Court of Justice from difficulty, which has occurred since 2008, to the background of a serious economic crisis that has affected the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company Gonzal · Saddy calls for a new trial directly at the revocation court, so that the trial will be completed, then, for five judges, because they voted only three.
It will not succeed here, as a correct revision of the process of higher institutions, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is important that the court recalled the document sent by the Mexican Government as a guest of friendus curiae, in which the procedure is detailed by Vitro in the context of the Concurrence Act and in which it is indicated that the company has facilitated it by providing the agreements signed by both countries to confront the law with the Act of the United States.
Moreover, it shows that the country has subjected to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, which are the rules for international cases and responsibility to ensure equality for debtors and creditors.
Return to both sides: Vitro and State justice.

Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketbal was my life"
Basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was connected to this salt sport over 60 years and processed through him the whole world.
A few people in Portorica have a number of people in the local basketball history like Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before in 2008 the brain murderer was thrown into the cocktail chair in this sport after more than 60 years, or as a player of younger categories, a player of the national basketball BSN, a master and a trainer of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball lise, or the President of Portorial Basketball Federation.
"I stayed in the course of my life in basketball a lot of role, in particular some at the same time, as when I was in the 90s of the National League BSN, the General Actor of the National Team and the President of the Federation," Reyes called on the visit of the newspapers of Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he lives for more than 50 years with Isabel, his famous wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes in his statement doesn't stop.
The walls of his house, which are almost all embraced by his long career and the subjects of his long care.
Bayamon in the heart
With the biggest movement of all stations, those who act in the Los Vaqueros from the half of the 50th, where he was player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as a conciliator or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, that I was most enjoying, because I had the opportunity with the Vaqueros team from 1967 to eight mysteries, whether as a owner, a partner, or a trainer.
It was a number of successful years, including five championates made in 1971 to 1975.
And then I discovered a championate - in 1981 when Jerome Mincy debuted in the BSN.
Then the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great leader," Reyes said.
"I feel that Gene Bartow, who was a trainer here before and acted on the Albanian University in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a big two-meter player for you.
You want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Portorico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the player of Raymonda Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shoots.
I hope he said, if Mincy brings Bayamo's winning in the champion, then Gausse will contribute to the next."
Shampionate, when the Vaqueros team played Gausse, was enjoyed, but just far, because the president of the Basketball Federation was already executed in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to be full of his lives and enjoy Mincy's place in the National Team.
"I feel how we first struck the United States in the Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then the world's mastership came in 1990, where we ended the quarter, but we had to have a bronze to be the Canadian decision that allowed us to repeat the final invasion," Reyes said.
Is a man from the world's mastership in 1990 the best national team you ever saw?
It's among the best, like the one who struck Dream Team in Olympia in 2004.
But my favorite was a national team in the Pan-American games in Cuba in 1991, when we wined gold and split the United States manship, which was enough like that we had a bronze on the world's mystery.
This manship had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers of León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 for the wound of the gentlemen.
A man who could not have perfect charges, but who could win the golden medal and bring great joy was a man from the olympic ability in 1995 in the argentin Neuquen.
With players on the players, like "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and the younger player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players out of the way in the Panama games in Mar de Plata, we wined gold despite all the suggestions.
What was the best portoric player?
It was without any doubt of Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers of international tours are effective.
No one from Portorica has reached this level of results such as Piculin.
I don't talk about his action in different diseases where he played.
Who was the best portoric trainer?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that belongs to Julio Toro, Flor Melléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armmandito Torres.
I like the young people of Leo Arilla's work.
What is your success in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of national humanity in 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of 90 years, BSN had a national liga in one of 17 men.
What didn't you do to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth category by regions.
For example, the boys from Ponce would only play in their own area and cooperate with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-offs.
Now the kids are a lot of traveling and playing too much money, which isn't necessary.
I also see the contribution in the obligation certificates and curves for trainers, decision-making assistants and decision-making.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing now?
I'm listening to music, looking at YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoying infancy and sometimes walking on basketball storages.
And, of course, I'm enjoying my wife Isabel, who was ggecky at my side.
He died here Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Wordh in Texas, was worldwide listening to the main role of John Rose Ewing, known as "J.R." in the TV series Dallas, in which he was a man who acted independently and was funny and manipulating.
Larry Hagman, whose role in the famous magnitude of J.R. Ewing in the TV series of Dallas became a symbol of lactation in the 80s.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who was returned for years as J.R. in the new series of Dallas, died in accordance with the official notice of the family that the agency offered by Press the production company from Dallas Warner Bros. on Wednesday on the complication associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his loved family town Dallas, where he played again the iconic role that he had most of them," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends with him were in Dallas on the Day of Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was a representative of his wife in a pizza and new series, was with Hagman at the moment when he died in the Daily hospital," announced her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"It was creative, great, funny, nice, kind and talented, and it's gonna be terriblely to meet him.
He was unique and lived full of his life," Linda Gray reported.
Hagman's appealed in 1992, and he himself admitted that a lot of years had been drunk.
In 1995, he had been found a loss of relief on the iron, and Hagman had been transplanted.
A year before sending a series of Dallas, Hagman in television was celebrated as an obedient boy in the delighted comediation I Dream of Jeannie sent NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
This is the game of Tony Nelson, astronauta, whose life will change when he met an attractive girl (gina) playing Barbara Eden, and we will take her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies that were sent only shortly, and this is The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His filming included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was until Hangman's mysterious execution in the form of an incredible offset J.R., which brought him to the star top.
The dramatic series of the CBS station on Ewings clone and other characteristics around them was sent from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shot Jejar?", which had to call for a expectation about the work of a full emotion when Hangman's position was almost killed, caused not only a huge number of speculators around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in tax offices.
This work also helped to achieve a record in the study.
In November 1980, the answer was discovered was observed in the average of 41 million television divisions, where Dallas became the second most followed distress after the mission of the MASH series in 1983, which followed 50 million divisions.
On J.R., she shot his swimming Christin (they played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. were worried and then threatened her to mark her as a prostitute if she didn't leave the city, but others were here who had to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an unusual chamtizer with charismatic smile: an unbelieving employer and an unbelieving husband who tried to have his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was alcoholic, was closed in the treatment.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the grave stone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing he didn't get out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the p-series, remembered on Friday on Hagman as someone who was "wonderful on the plane and outside".
It is unforgettable and unreplaceable for millions of wonderful people in the world and in the hearts of us all who had the happiness to know and love him.
Ten parts of the new series of Dallas sent TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"The five parts of the second row have been completed and the sixth was just running," she informed the TV station.
Without prejudice to Hangman's death, there was no statement available from Warner or from the TNT station on how the series will continue.
The parent from Fort Worth in Texas was a son of herds and songs Mary Martins, who played in classical works, such as the SouthPropertyific and Peter Pan musicals.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she born Larry in 1931, whose father was her wife, a lawyer Ben Hagman.
At the beginning of the 50 ’ s, Larry tried happiness at the divadel scenes in New York, and then in 1952 to 1956 served in England at the airport.
There he met the young Swedish architect of Axelson who was married.
The marriage couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and age lived in the California city of Malibu, where they lived a lot of celebrities.
In 2001, he issued an autobiographic book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't give anything about what I learned that it could hurt someone or hurt him," said Agency Prensa Asociada.
After jater transplanting, he began to promote the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer in the hospital where he helped the poor patients.
"I love them, I add courage, I meet them when they go to operations and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the meaning "Do not be afraid, it's gonna be a little inappropriate, but you'll be healthy."
He was also a activist in the fight against rain and has become different campaigns.
Starts a course that tests "the end of the world"
Each week, students consider apocalyptic theme as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global inflation.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would make a course on the end of the world, he felt that it was an inexcusable lacade: the end of the "long number" of May's calendar, which was to come once 21.
However, Charme had no idea of what he expected in the next months: the Katastrophal Urikan Sandy, the budgetal destruction that some of them named "Lugue Armageddon", and the growing conflict in which Israel was inflicted, in the place in which, according to Christians who are theoretizing the end of the world, Apocalyps begins.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most inapprophyptical semester that he was," Charme said this week to Rutgers' University students in Camden in New Jersey.
When a man decides what's going on today in the world, as if we were 30 days, it's really a good time.
And remember that wrong means for apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only professor who offers the "the end of the world" in this semestre, which is the theory's last in the ovals.
At the University of Temple, a professional assistant Barry Vacker is the "Centers, Cultures and the end of the world".
Each week, students consider apocalyptic theme as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global inflation.
"We consider why these thoughts are extended with time," he says, "and how hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to certain human behaviors.
For example, the nuclear material will get into the hands of terrorists, the war can explode.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic subjects and see how different they are from examples of real life.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania, the Latin American History Professor Matthew Re® and his college Amara Solariova, the professional assistant of the history of art and antropology to arrange a course with a simple name The end of the world.
"We don't add "2012", because we're calculating the opportunity to arrange the course again if the world doesn't end," Re >
Although the "dangerous trial" has to be students to study, create projects and make final tests.
At Penn State, a final trial will be made at the evening of Apocalyps, which does not give students any other opportunity than to work "to the evening of the world's expected end," Re— said.
The curses became enough arrays.
"He went up to two hours," Re > said about his course for students with a higher prospect of which was notified 35.
Weak and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mail question if it's still a place.
Only students assure that the course is one of the most interesting ones.
"I'm going to be fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," she said at the Rutgers University at Camden 23-year Bridgid Robinson, a student of religious and socialism from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
So apocalyptic, worldwide or religious thinking is only a question of comfort or absent.
Will Wekes, a 25-year student of psychology and treatment, said he had seen all apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard about the hour in which it could be learned," he said.
"I use it."
But none of the students, then the professor, said that it would be at the end of the 21st.
"Our first project was negotiated about the magic responsibility and in the same way we're rejecting it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year student of the last year at the Temple University of West Chester.
"May's never foretold the end of the world; it's only a key point in the calendar," Re > said.
But he added that in the west culture there is an apocalyptic ocean, which takes a few centuries back, which people react to the changes of their environmental prophecies on the end of the world.
The flower of these speculations caused the Internet.
"Where else people don't think about it," said he.
That's what's going on in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religious religion at the University of La Salle, who has been transferred to the Philippines for years, asked whether he knows the "the end of the world" course there.
"The Philippines are not involved in the end of the world," he wrote and indicated an exception to the Highest Authority.
We have mercy from Papa.
Re > noted that during the years, it was spoken about many days of the last court, and he said that if nothing happens 21, "the people will start thinking about the next date" or to filosof that 21th is the beginning of the seventh period in which the world will end.
The date of students and professors takes a light weight.
A few of them said they wanted to go to the "the end of the world" celebration.
"I'll call some friends, and they're laughing together," explained the twenty-year student of Samira Ford's communication.
