Scientists found a way to discover family stars
Astrophics from the Californian University in Sant-Cruz studied turbulent mixture and its impact on chemical units in stars.
It is expected that the opening of experts will allow family stars to search, namely those from one classer.
The results of their studies by the authors of OpProperty in the Nature magazine, and they can be met shortly on the university site.
The cause of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulent mixture of gas clouds that preceding the education of stars.
Even if the star's born then leaves the star classer, it can be determined as a him’s place of its birth and the region of the education of the stars of the family.
In the past, scientists have doubted that the evolution of the stars outside the class could lead to the differences in its hym’s content of such a family in the class.
The results of astrophysic modeling are that such differences should not occur.
In its investigation, the supercomputer specialist had two flows of internal gas that together form the cloud.
This object will be converted into a classic class for several million years under its own gravity.
Scientists added to the original gas flows and established that the high level of the unity of a high-speed turbulent mixture in the cloud was reached.
As astrophysics are considered, their investigation shows that the chemical stars can be searched and to determine the areas of education of such objects.

In view of the responsibilities of our measures on the case of a new antirossian sanctions, I will not even consider, rate, because it must be considered specifically, " he said.
And when we realize what Peace and American partners will like this, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be with the guy's door, with some misunderstandings, underlined the Minister.
We will first turn away from our interests, our interests in protecting our economy, our sector, our citizens, our business, and make out the conclusions of partners to their appropriateness, agreement and confidence.
Following the steps that are undertaken in the field of sanctions, it can be very well judged what partners are achieved, - the head of MID RF continued.
If the whole voice says, "These sanctions will also be sick for us, but we have to go on this to punish Russia," it is probably not very appropriate."

Remembering the very American ideal of the fact that work rights are human rights
The Congressmen of Kit Ellison and John Lewis proposed a legislative project to protect professionals as civil law.
"Where are the professionals, there and the servants of the Middle Class," says Ellison, a democratic from Minnesota, who is the President of the Congress of the Progressive Fraction.
That's why I am proud to represent the Act on the Extension of the Rights of the Citizens, together with the symbol of the movement for the citizens' rights of John Lewis.
This innovative legislative project will provide the same legal opportunities for the discrimination of professional organizations as in other forms of discrimination, remaining the strength of the opponents
Amendment of the Law on the Ruling of Work in order to allow those who have discrimination to participate in the organization of professionals to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation to damage and injury - an initiative.
However, this is certainly not radical initiative -- at least, by American standards.
In fact, the best way to discover what Ellison, Lewis and the co-operators of the law project is to remember the very American thought.
Despite the attacks that have been affected in the past years in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, the Americans sometimes supported the countries of the world in order to accept, expand and respect the work rights.
There was a time to remember millions of Americans when this country protected the democracy, the freedom of word, the freedom of printing and the right to the body.
When the United States of Ockup of Japan after the Second World War, General Duglas Artur and its assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution consisting in order to ensure that the militarised autocracy of Hideki To'io was replaced by democracy.
With full understanding that the professionals and their professionals played a role in the form of a new Japanese, they included the text that directly recognised that "the rights of the body and the negotiations and the collective facility are guaranteed".
When the United States of Ockup of Germany after the Second World War, General Duitt David Azenhauer and his assistants helped Germans to write a constitution that guarantees that Adolpha Hitler's fashism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the need to organise and be heard in a new State, Germans included an article that was openly stated: "The right to train associations in order to protect and improve work and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and every profession or activities.
The agreements that make or seek to violate this right will not have the right of force; the measures aimed at these objectives will be recognised against law.
When the former Lady Eleonar Rusvelt was the President of the International Commission on Human Rights, which established a World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Rusvelt, and have included the guarantee that " each has the right to organize and enter into the promotion of its interests."
The American generations adopted as a basic situation that work rights are human rights.
When this country advises other countries about the creation of civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to the organization of professionals - and that it should be protected as a partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions.
Now that these rights are subject to attacks in America, it is wise to come back to the American idea that the workers must have the right to the body and that their votes should be heard in free and open society.
As Martin Luther King Youth said for fifty years ago:
History is a big teacher.
Now everyone knows that the promotional movement has not touched the power of the nation, but has increased them.
By taking up the lives of millions, the promotion was wonderfully created the industry market and raised the whole level of production to the unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack these simple truths are forgotten, but the story will remember them.
The story remembers what we need to do.
Official recognition of work rights as human rights - and enlargement of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against the organization of professionals - has been decreased for a long time.
Kit Ellison and John Lewis regenerate ideals that have historically expanded America and made a promise of democracy reality.
The Court shall temporarily block the law that could close all abort clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, the Federal Court has temporarily concluded the introduction of the Law of Louisiana, which his parties say that he will, mostly, close all five abort clinics in the state.
According to this, which was signed to the execution of the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Ginadle in June and had to enter into force on 1 September, the doctors who make aborts should have the power of accepting patients in the hospital in 30 miles of their prospectus.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to act with an abortion at the present time and continue to seek such powers.
"The artists will be allowed to work in order to continue to receive powers," wrote Judge John de Grevellz in his decision.
The respect will be appointed for a month on which the judge will make a more continuous decision on this law.
The rights of abortion have been pleased to meet this decision, the last decision against similar measures, saying that it will give doctors more time to receive hospital powers.
"This further decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from the injury law that is seeking to lose their health and rights," said Nancy Nortap, the President and the Ru Director of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which requested the removal of the law from the three of the five clinics of the State.
It was not obvious whether a decision was made to doctors from two clinics who did not speak to the leaders on this matter and also made a statement for the approval.
Louisiana is in 11 states who have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognized such non-constitutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the rest of the clinic in this state, were locked by the federal judges on Friday.
The fighters for the right to abort, together with the American Association of Acquisers and Genecals and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on the right to abortion are on doctors that are not meant to medical views.
The opposers of the aborts claim that such measures are addressed to the protection of women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effects in the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who makes an abort in Louisiana has the power of receipt in the hospital, reported the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all other doctors in the state were required to stop executing this procedure, the doctor, fearing its security, would stop to implement this procedure, reported the group.
By criticizing this decision, the Lewisian officers said that they would not be punished by the doctors who are acting for abortion until their statements on the authority were expected to make decisions.
The introduction of the quota to parental products
At least half of the products on each kind of goods in the marketing networks should be a Russian production, the Deputate of the House from the Fraction " Justice of Russia" Oleg Nilov.
The Parliament has prepared a draft legislation aimed at introducing protection measures for parental producers.
The document will be further detailed to avoid the possible discomfort for purchasers.
This is the case of goods that are not produced in Russia, and the rest of the product groups produced in Russia must give at least half of its pounds to parental producers," Nil reported.
However, amendments to the article " On the basis of Public Trade Management in the RF" provide for amendments to the Tax Code, which establish a decreased NDS rates of 10 per cent in the implementation of the products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing 50 per cent of the quota in trade networks includes the stimulating measures for Russian producers.
There are several times more parental goods on the ships.
However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, the experts say.
According to the Company, a member of the independent expert centre of the " Public Duma" Sergei Lithwinenko, for Russian economy, as well as for patriotic agricultural and food plants, will have an effect on the characteristics and will lead to growth.
Moreover, the farmers, the farmers, the small stores will be shown.
They get to sell more, and that means that the arrival will grow.
Moreover, they will have the right to dictate their conditions and prices, because they will have to buy their goods.
The Russian producers are able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase the budget income and create new places of slavery, which will begin to expand, as soon as possible, contribute to the growth of the WTO.
Russia's dependence on the foreign product will be decreased in several times, indeed, not in contrast," notes the expert.
The former Russian enterprises were not often trying to join stores because of a high competition from remote analogs.
Now, after the introduction of the bargo, this neck is free and can be released.
However, it should not be forgotten that, after all health and health checks on the Russian market, products from the countries of Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be carried out.
In other words, there is now a "moment to break", when the former players have gone, and the news have not yet come.
After nearly a month, you can talk about an adult question on the parental series and the growth of prices for prepared production," — AIF.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian Group of Financial Directors, including Tamar Kazianov.
The idea of sale in each category at least 50 per cent of Russian products will be allowed to strengthen the sector for manufacturers.
In that case, they will competite each other, not with goods that, due to the subsidy of another State, are eligible.
In other words, the fight for the purchaser will be spread between companies working under one law.
On the other hand, Cassanov notes that Russian producers are able to satisfy 50 per cent of the internal needs of societies not far over all articles.
In this situation, trade networks should be "attracted" from the part of Russian goods to half of the assortiment.
This is the age of an age of threats that ungodly goods will be made on the markets.
An expert adds that, as the species of Russia's products are being placed in stocks with broken labels," may be found in Russia.
The negative effect of the introduction of the quota is to be felt of major trade networks, especially those who are eligible to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers also suffer, since the question for their production is reduced.
Lithwinenko does not exclude that the quota law for parental goods may also be reflected on consumers.
The fact is that some Russian products may be able to enter into the quality of import analogues, while the stores are able to raise prices for second, such as the deficit.
The idea of importation of the economy was forgotten at the beginning of the 2000s again discussed in February this year because of the uninterrupted disabilities of the rubble.
The question of refusal from import products now becomes more active on the back of the western and west.
The law is required to charge the employees in the form of orders to provide for the manufacturers to be considered as parental producers.
Then we will go much faster and more safe on the road of imports, and the production planning system will be created for a shorter time," says Deputate Oleg Nilov.
In particular, the quotation mechanism will be for agricultural sectors where the potential was particularly high, for example in milk growth, where the import share was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are actually able to cover a complete covering of Russian stocks.
Furthermore, the powerful impulse can also receive milk production.
As it is possible, the largest part of imports is maintained by a bovine - from 30% to 35%.
65-70 per cent are still in Russian production, "that is Cassan's consideration.
Experts believe that the introduction of quota for parental products is advanced in imports and may have this process.
However, this initiative will not lead to imports itself, since it is necessary for a comprehensive measure, certain Lithuania.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold by this initiative can still be brought out of the border, meaning that the full-valued import replacement is not happening, but that means the steps in this direction will be made.
Moreover, the quotas should be fixed, and the production of vegetable products in the country should still be set up in order to carry out these quotas.
The quotas of such guarantees and guarantees are likely to be provided," the expert states.
Immediate diagnosis and the absence of access to optimal treatment means that egg cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Joly and her brother James reported a video of their resting mother, who died from the cancer of the eggs in 2007.
Women in Australia's rural ability are increasingly higher risk of death than the egg cancer than those in the towns.
In 2005, the analysis of the cards of more than 1100 Australian women with the diagnosis of the egg cancer was discovered that only 35 per cent had been spent five years after the diagnosis was established.
The conducting studies of the QIMR Berghofer Institute Susan Jordan reported that the possibility of death during 20 per cent of those living in regions and remote state areas is more than those living in urban areas.
NEW EXCLUSION: New medicines may affect cancer and egg cancer
The researchers followed women's medical way in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of egg cancer, the present diseases and the socioeconomic status have also affected the probability of survival.
Women of age and those who had cancer at the late stage of diagnosis were the lowest coef of survival.
For those who lived in regions or remote State holdings, the probability of death during the investigation was 20 per cent above than for those who lived in citizen areas.
Although an investigation was not intended to determine why women in the midst of cities are more likely to die from the cancer of eggs, Dr. Jordan suggested that the untimely diagnosis and the absence of access to optimal treatment were factors.
"This disease is best treated by chirurgs specialising the geneology of the oncology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite increasing the quality of the telecommunication services in order to reduce the impact of the distance, she suggested that increased number of services in the outcome that would allow the professionals to treat women closer to home, and programmes of support for people who are from home can help.
Dr. Jordan said that, independent of the geographic situation, an investigation showed that the long-term life between women with egg cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and profile.
An investigation that Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in Medical Journal of日a.
In March 2012, 33 years of age, a young mother from the Golden Elise Nive said that she had an aggressive cancer of eggs.

Inflation is out of the release.
Whether growing rare price grows
As a result of RF and West Sanctions, the inflation in Russia will be undertaken and will not be included in the prognoses of the VTB capital analysis.
According to experts, the consequences of antisons will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBK Daily writes.
According to the latest prognoses of the Mineco-Environment, in 2014 the inflation was 6,5-7,5 per cent and at least 6,5 per cent.
However, according to the Commercent newspaper, the MER must be "small but principles" in the macroeconomic prognoses until 2017.
According to issues, the inflation could be reduced for 2015, allowing the expected reduction of population income growth.
The preliminary prognoses suggested that the productivity sanctions of the RF were to be carried out in the year to August 2015.
How could such an inflation be so high in such a situation?
The current situation provides a divorce choice, but the humiliating inflation trend will not be changed," said the source of the newspaper in Minfine.
Economys from the RTB capital do not share the expectations of the Government's financial-economic block of infringement and predict the increase of prices in 2014 at 8%.
The basic effect of product prohibitions will be with the introduction in the RF regions of the sales (N) in 2015, which have been required by experts.
The inflation pick will be 9 per cent in the February, and the annual growth of prices will be in the fall, and the experts.
Instead, Rosstat took the first inflation results last week after the RF introduced "accurate sanctions".
AIF.ru asked experts and discovered their inflational expectations.
Artem Deev, an analytic Department of FK AForex:
The price growth is already observed in the main segments of the goods.
Moreover, when a significant product was charged, the Government had to implement a system monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risk of unbased increase in prices in a short-term periphe.
The suppliers and the directors are already based on a daily basis to the regulatory bodies so that the authorities may know exactly who, for what reason and why, starts the increase of prices.
The key factors of the growth of consumer prices continue to remain colossate to the capital flow, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mechanism, the internal conversion because of the refuge of the population in the foreign currency, and the barrga for the import of food products from countries, are subject to sanctions against Russia.
If the inflation pressure remained under control, the value of the minimum set of products would not exceed 12 per cent for one quarter.
The prohibition of imports of food products has been prohibited by a shock of proposals on the internal market and has led to a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since we are not able to completely launch import mechanisms and to increase the autonomousness of the Russian market on the basis of the internal production, the sanctions responsible will continue to carry out the risk of inflational growth.
In addition to the physics of the reasons that have no confidence in the national currency, as well as the harmful economic growth, the inflation can be over 8% to the end of this year.
Alexander Razwajev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation had sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, and in the zero, it was also above the current level, the second thing that the compensation was then a fast economic growth.
I think the inflation will be 8-8.5 per cent over the year.
Maguta Platon, managing the UC Fond Maguta activity
The external factor with sanctions against Russia until it is successful, but if there is further pressure, especially for the financial sector, it can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of populations that are traditionally shown in purchases of tax currency in order to ensure their deficiency.
The Government, the CBR and the Financial Ministry may have tried to reduce the low reduction of the rubber and the market methods and the public governance.
But the growth of the prices starts traditionally after the summer and may be more sensitive to this egg.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is at 7.5 per cent, mostly, because the RF is still available for financial income.
Sadduceous centres are decreased from reducing the number of householders
Such a fall which is determined by the exceptional reduction of the number of householders at least 35 years may lead to the loss of ten millions of pounds per year when today’s young consumers are the "based age of garden", the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.

In Londres, where the number of householders fell from 61 to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest level in the United Kingdom for gardens for household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society reported that the jardins and the absence of space for garden does not mean that people can't grow.
Gay Barter, leader of RHS, said: "The promotion of containers, for example, is a population of farmers who can carry out the movement."
The HTA report defined a period between 1997 and 2005 as a "Guld Age" of various goods for garden, in order to increase the number of householders and economic flows from the end of 1980s to the average of 1990s.
It also states that the market will be improved in this year, thanks to the better time after the injury in March and April of the last year.

Turkey calls for the American diploma in relation to the report of spionship
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has issued the highest American diploma in the country to explain the report on the American and British Spain in Turkey.
Prime Minister Bullent reported that the American trusted in cases and Turkish offices discussed a message on Monday.
The German Journal "Der Spiegel" and the Internet Journal "The Intercept" reported that the documents provided by the former Analysis of the National Security Agency of the United States Edward Snowden reported that Turkey was a priority for American and British Inspector Services.
According to the Turkish news agencies, the President of Turkey Redzep Tayip Erdogan had understood the importance of this report, saying that all leading countries would spy one another.
The information reported earlier about the fact that Ankara had also made an investigation of the main investigation agency, and the Turkish Government had expressed a more fierce response.
The major Chinese companies were united against Aliba
The Chinese companies, including the largest part of the commercial disability in China in Dalian Wanda Group and the Internet gygants Tencent Holdings (sockets, missenger and Dr.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese searcher), create a company that will competite on the online trade market with Alibababa.
However, the Chinese Internet's miracle, which has left behind even their American co-operators - eBay and Amazon.com, will be uncomfortable.
The Greatest Union
Companys plan to include 5 billion Juanians ($814 million), 70 per cent of Wanda and 15 per cent of each of the Internet companies, stated in the Wanda Group's report.
The registration of the company is planned in Hong Kong.
✔ Combines the Baidu search services with the weChat-based WeChat-form (the largest number of users in China, which contains approximately 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 holiday towns, the Wanda group manages at least 49 objects of commercial insufficiency throughout China and 40 trade centers.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Juanai (better than 8 billion dollars) in the building of China and the subject of a park of discharges in Cindao (town on East China in the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to take over 1 million visitors every year and offer $960 million income.
Furthermore, Wanda belongs to the American AMC Entertainment Holdings network, which makes the company a largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its trade centres, hotels and locations of e-commerce services, which will be developed as a concurrent of Alibaba.
According to Dun Cé, which will enable a new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of their e-commerce services from currently 40 million people to 100 million to the year.
The new area must be the largest form of the world online to offline, notes Dun Ce.
The online-to-off-line communication (O2O) is involved in purchases on the Internet, in order to be in common offlines or other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O I are sold buying services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest "piрог" on the online commercial," said the Wanda Van Zhinlin (cited by Bloomberg).
"The current O2O area in China does not exist, and in this situation the opportunity is about all," he believes.
The Chinese Internet trade market is the largest world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., its amount will increase more than three times up to 2015, compared to 2011, up to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet operators grows up to 632 million, Bloomberg provides the official statistics: it is more people of any world than India.
And in the prognoses, this number can grow up to 850 million people until 2015.
The Union of the Richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten was the most rich man of China, but the index of the Bloomberg agency's millions, the foundation of Aliba Jack Ma has already seized it for $5,5 billion.
With J.M., $21.8 billion are estimated, from which $11 billion come to its part in Alibaba.
The Ru Baidu Robin Le is now a third place among the richest people of China, while Van Zhinlin from Wanda is the fourth rating.
"For this battle, it is very interesting to observe: three of the richest humans are attempting to abandon the calls more rich," said Bloomberg's director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce in Hanchjou Cao Lay.
But he believes that the new company would be able to compete seriously with Alibaba after the creation: "Rome" for one day.
The fact that Alibaba is not so simple to associate not only with new companies but also with the worldwide trade leaders, it is evident that the report on the financial indicators of Alibaba is the last quarter.
Alibaba often describes something more average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company had more than both of its American competitors taken together.
The pure Alibaba acquisition for nearly two times exceeds the same summary indicator of competitors - it has grown almost three times in the annual calculation and has costed $1,99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a great potential for generating money, in greater way thanks to its mobile applications," says the Bloomberg report of an analysis from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba on the United States Values Paper and Birge Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, which exceeded the March Indicator (163 million people).
In this case, 32.8 per cent of all alibaba transactions for the past quarter came on the device's mobile.
Alibaba should be called the value of its actions before the IPO.
According to the average evaluation of 11 analyses requested by Bloomberg, the company can be evaluated at $187 billion after sale of action.
According to the sources of Bloomberg, Alibababa at the New York Foundation (NYSE) can be taken on 16 September.
The Road-show company that preceded this event starts on 3 September.
It is expected that the outcome of Alibababa to the IPO will be recorded in the NYSE history and allows the company to have about $20 billion.
Before this couple of records on the amount of the United States funds belonged to the Visa-based system, which was the first place of its actions in 2008 for $17.9 billion.
At least half of the products in trade networks must be Russian production, but the deputates of the House consider.
They repeated the legislative project on this subject.
The amendments to page 8 FZ " On the basis of public trade management in the RF" and the Tax Code.
The objective of the document is to introduce protection measures in relation to Russian producers of productivity.
The significant clarification of the legislation project must be at least 50 per cent of the product of the fabrics in the stocks.

Magalufa Police Chef has been accused of corruption
The issues have demonstrated the fact that the police and officers of the municipality of Calvia were demanded in the Office of the State Prosecutor Malorki on Friday.
Colombia's police head on the Kurort Island Malork was arrested as a result of accusations in the corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandal centre of the unexpected drinking of Magalufe.
The Master Inhabor Hose Antonio Navarro was invoked by the accusations of the corruption against him by several businessmen with Punta Ballene, the street in which the majority of the bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the report of the daily online issue of Mallorca Diario, the staff proved that the police and officers of the municipality of Calvia were required at the Office of Mallorca Prosecutors on Corruption on Friday.
Two other police officers were arrested by the National Garden of Spain for Corruption accusations and were invited by the judge and Navarro.
Spanish everyday in ABC reported that the owners of the night clubs were unfairly saying that the Protectionism from the authorities is seriously reflected in their business status.
"It is no longer to say about money, money, and -- to survive," said one of the businessmen.
Without putting our sources under threat.
We don't have anything to lose.
Magaluf was in the heading of the international press this year after the population of the YouTube videographer, in which a 18-year British relief was shown to 24 men during the bathroom.
The authorities of the island are trying to interrupt the humidity in the incidence of the incidence of Mahalupha, with a minimum number of scandal alcohol refugees on bars.
Furthermore, the Playhouse club, where an incident occurred, had to be closed for a year while Playhouse and the Carnage refugee organisers were borrowed together for $55,000 ($73000).
The tourist curt Magaluf, mainly the population among the young British reliefs, was also a place of many accidents in the situation of alcoholic disorder, with a stupid party, such as "balconing", when people come from one balcone to another or from a balcony to a hotel base.
The first day of the weight is noted by mockers and wind conditions affecting flights in Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise on the south of South Australia by bringing rain rain and winds that affected the airport of Adelaide.
More five miles of rain fell on the town at night to 9th evening, after 6,6 mm, which you're on Sunday night.
The latest rain was a couple of short wind winds before, including the wind that started by the eighth evening and smoke about 4 mm in approximately 10 minutes.
After the winter had exposed the early weight weight in the last week, the temperature fell again on Monday until the winter was only 15.8C in the city.
As a result of the delay of the Virgin Airlines travel from Melbourne in Adelaide, there was a delay for the delay of the trip of Virgin Airlines.
The airplane had to be landed after 7th-30th dinner, but the wind was moved into the area of the wind, the immediate change of the speed or the direction of the wind at a short distance, and it had to be taken into the height.
The wind flows reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flying data showed that the airplane had to have a height during the second landing, and the airplane finally reached approximately 8:40 at the evening.
The delay of this trip was made to the next delay of several other travels, including the Emirates travel from Dubai and the Qantas travel from Sidney.
16C is proclaimed in Adelaide on Thursday with the probability of one or two lines.
The calculation of building objects in the RF will take place again
The issues of price-building, the management of building growth, as well as the problems of connecting to the networks of the Federal Anti-Anthony Service to control.
The FAS was established by an expert advice on the development of competition in the building area.
At its meeting, the Government Chapter of JKH, Building and Natural Resources of the FAS Vadim Slovjev stated that "the current counting of building objects is absolutely incomprehensible."
The North Base makes prices intransparency and can lead to an unbased building price, which is considered in the FAS.
And the value of the building of hostility objects at the design stage is to determine market prices in place of today's accounting standards and single assessments for technological operations.
These proposals are "to the card" and are now discussed in mystery.
"The replacement of the traditional accounting documentation in the building of counts should lead to a smaller corruption in adults," explained the "RGB" Vodim Solovjev.
Because every pain and hair is now considered, and it is not always expected to check everything, so some of the non-conscious buildings of the company can be buried by "the whole tractor".
In mystery with the FAS.
"First on the transfer to the value of the value of the elements already exists: once the methods for the calculation of the prices for co-active decisions, the calculation of these indicators, the " GBB" is the head of the Department of the Gradient Activity and the Mine-Department of Elena Jukov.
As a pilot, a street building sector is selected.
However, experts believe that the problem is far more serious.
As the "RGB" chapter of the "Profi-Invest" Anatoly Demianko, the estimated standards have been stopped for a long time, but the other business mechanism has not been proposed until.
"What is the case with the responsibility of the co-active elements, it is difficult to make it difficult, since in the construction of comments, it is often used to be completely different technologies," he believes.
Not a secret that the building is developed in a lot thanks to the gentlemen.
According to the President of the NP " Expert Communication of Professional Guests" Ecaterina, the State is today the most payment-speed officer.
The Director for the Engineering Centre of the Capital Construction Centre of Rosatom Vladimir Malachov noted that the market is now divided into companies with access to contract portfolio and companies possessing monopolemic competences and not allowing competitors.
He believes that the establishment of a transparency market is possible only when access to contracts will be maximally threatened by any managing effect.
The expert Council was proposed to formulate the ladies ' s system so that one of the same artists would not be able to receive more than 1 billion billion rubs contracts or a number of contracts for more than 1 billion billion rubs.
In mystery, this approach must be taken from the view of business impact and the effectiveness of building management.
As Elena Jukov explained, in this case, it would be necessary to provide the applicant to the functions of the generator, which will lead to a increase in the number of states and budget expenditure for its content.
In this case, the officer's specialists should have knowledge that allows the quality of the subordinates to evaluate and their safety.
It is often necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object.
Furthermore, this approach may be eligible for high-qualificated bodies in relation to independence in receiving public orders for an incomplete amount and a small amount of contract.
The Secretary of the Expert-Consultation Centre of the Buying Institute of Alexander’s Institute considers that the lawyer's procedure has now been converted into a business game to the holder's attention.
And he introduced such an example: "part in the compliance of the application should specify "concernal indicators" without indication of the words: "or equivalent", "better", "better", "likely", "or" "type", "not below", "better", "better", "before", "before", "before", "not earlier", "not above", "no more", "not allowed", etc.
Thus, the applicants often misuse their right to establish the requests for the content of the request submitted by the subordinate.
Another issue of 44-FZ, according to the opinion of the Stashenkov, was needed to evaluate further the quality request of work through the "bumping" proposal of the participant.
In view of the application of the participant, only the quantity of the subsequent can be evaluated, but not the quality of which they have not yet been implemented, it is a expert.
The quality of Property can be evaluated only in their receipt.
The Expert Council also was proposed to transfer the marginal income from the below asheol to the extent of interim income.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the Secretary of the Secretary of the FAS Andrew Carikovski, believes that it is not worth doing this, since the Officer must be responsible for the order.
And otherwise, as in the reprise of Arcadia Raikin's Atel: "There's appeal to the claimers?"
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the territory near the Gaza sector returned to school Monday after the aerodrome in bombs, when rackets and mines fell on their habitation during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza sector remained closed when the territory was restored after fighting.
The beginning of school employment led to the feeling of joy and anxiety that suffered from the rake of South Israel’s habitations, but the tracks of warfare have remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the garden "Pass" in which the racket was found, the tracks of rocks from the wall and the villages were removed before the disciples arrived.
"We are a little scared, but with a pleasure in the future," said Ronit Bart, Kibuz Saad inhabitant and English teacher in his school.
Many people in our territory really need to return to a large life.
She's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that once again to go to school "now strange."
"There was a difficult time, and we're not really you from your homes," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibuz, situated near the border of Gaza, to express its support.
Before the agreement on the break of fire stopped the war last week, thousands of cross-border villages such as Saad, you have not been on the street or left your homes, walking into the safe areas of Gaza to be saved from the rakeet and mining fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, near the border of Gaza, where the Palestinian mines were killed by a four-year-old boy, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a half of the family has not yet been returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Premier Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderote, the city at the border of Gaza, who was very excited from Palestinian fire.
He advised the students to learn carefully and said, "We will do everything that is possible to give you knowledge and ensure your security."
Israel and Hammas agreed on a timely confusion on the last Thursday.
The agreement on the interruption of the fire was the end of the fighting action, but the key issues remained, such as the Hamas requirement for the capture of the Egyptian block of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza sector.
Israel wants Hamas to put the weapons and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
It is expected that the new stage of indirect negotiations begins later in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2100 Palestinians, including three quarters of peaceful citizens, and at least 494 children, under the evaluation of the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel disrupts these numbers and claims that at least half of the murdered were warriors; despite that he does not predict the evidence of the facts confirming it.
From Israel, 66 soldiers and six peaceful inhabitants, including one Thai.
During the Hamas and other Gaza fighters, 4591 units were released in Israel ' s towns, most important in the southern country.
The Israeli army, then, had committed more than 5.000 air attacks and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of houses in the Gaza sector were vulnerable and disrupted, and, according to the evaluations, 250,000 people found a refuge in more than 100 schools that were converted into adjudications.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in prisons, and the fights continued, the leaders who were responsible for education left the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be opened so that we can finish our education as children of the world and children of the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amar, a 13-year-old boy who lives now in one of the Gaza school.
According to the popularity criteria, the highest winter growth was shown within seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic price prices in the Australian capital increased by 1,1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase led to a total increase in June, July and August to 4,2 per cent, the most important increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual growth of prices with 10.9 per cent, more than two more than 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not equally distributed by the country.
The RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sidney and Melbourne were two-level markets.
The RP data figures have increased by 16,1 per cent in Sidney in the last year, while in Melbourne 11,7 per cent.
The following markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where the average prices increased from five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, where governmental reductions had been reduced, where the prices were only 1,4 per cent per year.
Mr. Louses said that now, when the wheat was started, the increase in the number of objects of independence for sale will be observed in the next few months, which will be the "current expense" for the market.
"Reserving the current high level of aids speed, the general high speed of sales and the current conditions with low percentage rates, the value of the hedge is probably growing in the following three months," he said.
How people in the oldest house of Uphh
In the former house of golden industries and forests, Ivan Demid and his son on the road of October 57/1 (ex-Green Casana) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has not been practically changed if it does not be considered vital.
Foreign people are going here, as to the excussion, and the walls suffer more than they rejoice, because of their privilege, the right to live in the oldest Uphim House, whose walls are remembered by Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the building of the house is inaccurate, historicals indicate at two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But, in any case, it seems to be found that the tradition has been no longer 300 years old.
An old court, always open door, screwing the beach.
The doors in the apartment were spread close to each other, the walls were cut off, and in the light of the flat of the places it appears.
It seems that it's all holding on the honest word.
And the inhabitants of the world assured, "It is not for you, it is so."
It is very difficult to live in the 18th century in the tree house, says Tatian Lukianov, a resident of the apartment No. 3.
The object is on the hotel, but the money for its content is not assigned for decades, but we feel musical exposures that the authorities simply have forgotten.
The last reparation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still stuck, but the imagination has lost it.
Many guys are going to the street too, and they are once a week in the public ban.
How can we be long - suffering in such conditions?
The road goes directly under windows, not even in the past area.
Tatiana's running the cup.
It is now that it was only hearing that the car flow is below the windows.
See, the glass is always slow, the window can't be opened, but they've been used to the wheel.
But a man used to all things, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still model, thanks to the husband, his hands are golden.
Moreover, two of us have, we live in the morning with our son.
And other families have a much worse conditions, at the second stage, a half of the height is almost more than half meters.
For the contrast of Tatian, it is to go to a neighbor from the apartment No. 6 of the Old Age.
A pleasant guest woman has a coffee coffee and with a huge smile says:
We have a single apartment, 14,5 m2 for four men, so we live: we and our husband and daughter with a child.
I've been here since my own birth, and there's never been any other livestock, - Ludmila's faced the comma's eyes: anthresolas, two divan letters "g"; on one of them, a teenager was divided with a noutbuck.
Very close and little is different from the usual father-in-law: only a lot of beautiful, "historical".
However, with the result of the regulation, the water management system is not worth anywhere.
Ludmila speaks about her apartment dinner and wonderful at the same time as a Italian house in Roman ruins.
It is a very old and recent, daily and annual:
The waterway was carried about 40 years ago during the last reparation.
Then they made us a little kitchen in the cup and a toilet from the former cow.
We live there, where Demid's quarter and the family lived on the second stage.
Our apartment is not privatized, right?
In the Centre of Democracy of the Uffia, the privacy has no importance.
Still we'll only get a single apartment, we can't get a lot more.
Four months ago, we had been promised to break down, but the promised work has not gone further.
I haven't used to blame and I'm not going.
In this apartment, my grandmother and my father, I and my husband and my daughter with my grandmother.
Everything was for that time.
For example, healthy crops were running through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the floor, they're a metro distant!
They say, the solution was interrupted on the eggs, so it's holding so long.
The house was built primarily, thanks to Demid!
It is soon that no one has killed the wrath or its own.
Only the building is still quietly dead in our eyes: the tables and the houses are wounding, the fields have gone again, we have cut down the cement, but all the devils -- the solution is going to the ground as a cow.
They're saying, it's also - under our coming secret lace and walk to the White River, which has made sometimes older ones here so that they can be hidden from the danger in case of something.
They're pursuing them.
Ludmila's oldesty tells how some historian came to them, asked him to let him start in a breakfast apartment.
And then he fled to give them a livestock in exchange for his one on October.
Hudmilla historic from:
Where are we four in one?
And there's a little nice hope that they're going to give the bullet more space.
We agree to exchange, we wouldn't win anything anymore.
Yet, the Ancient's family did not win anything.
The biggest thought of Ludmila to displace them, and the daughter of the 16-year-old child gave a dealing committee.
Two families have assigned a double-country apartment instead of the greatest ruins in which two generations are now.
The sympathic, miniature of Olessa Carsakov from apartment No. 11 and 12 shows the second stage of home.
There are two tissues of a total area of 23 m2, named apartments, which live a large family.
We're seven people, two kids.
You're seeing what conditions you're doing.
The bullet is cut off by cups, as well as the frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rocks.
Water in the corner is only cold.
During the oldest of Uphy's apartment, you can be sure that more all have been happy with Lawrence wives from the apartment No. 4.
They take the most space comma in the first stage.
You're right, a lot of places!
Location in 75 squares, three persons are assigned.
We live in the horses where Suverov stayed at the end during his stay in Ufe, says Alexander Dmitrievich Lawrence's family chapter.
So high, space.
One bad thing, all around, it's swimming, swimming, switching.
The neighbors have probably already been told!
Most of us have been punished with the fields: the tree tables were cut down, the earth was literally departed from the foot.
I'm on the cup, kidneys; there's nothing yet in the hall, and in the other rock, as we're on the rocks, so much is it.
About the house of the buyer, Demid Alexandr Dmitrievich can tell the best of any exhibition.
The golden industry is like a family, speaking about it with an exciting.
In fact, the person was ungovernable: the Cagin and Uzian host built houses, split arms and cocktails, holded the Ural walls.
The inherents of the purchasing inevitability are deep, but they don't want to live under one of the story.
I had a child here in the 40s of the 20th century, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wood places around for caret, horse, and buildings, which were later with them.
In 1968, they wanted to remove our home, but something was dismissed...
The story was repeated in 2014: it was rebuild by a new jail.
As the team, we collected all documents, we had the needed institutions and immediately learned that the movement to the apartment was transferred to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in all this...
Two years ago, Lawrences went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Baskhortostan to learn about the judgment of the household.
The facts of the guy haven't accepted.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a smile, they gave a paper without signing and printing, "Cultural Ministership doesn't act against the displacement of the guilty."
I even felt that our home was not in the city for a long time, because he was under number 57, then 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it's been taken down in the 70s.
The "Russian Planet" refers to the instruction analysis sector of the Agricultural Resources of Vladimir Barabasha.
The Road House of October Revolution 57/1 is included in the white-leaving programme.
I can't answer for the actions of the 70s, but I know that the plan on the basis of all old houses was at that time, despite historical significance.
It has not happened, but the decision of modern authorities is to restore all elderly homes on the street of October revolution representing the →technical values has been successfully performed.
The railways are quickly planned to switch through new apartments.
According to Barabbasha, rebuilding the House of Demid will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the publications in Venice.
Now, in Italy, the Biennale is going through, and the "Old Upha" project is presented there among others.
I hope that all ancient ancient Casana has been restored to 2016, says the Officer.
The house will receive the appropriate species corresponding to those who were before, three centuries ago.
Demid's house, mostly, will be a museum open for all who want.
Moreover, at the Government level, it was decided to make a street in the past days.
Unfortunately, there will be too big threatening the road in the city.
The promising of people from the future Museum of Vladimir Barabbas promises in 2015.
But if they remain long enough, their new apartments will be the same place as the present.
Only from the other time.
The forest fire started in Primaria
The sugar was the cause of forest fire in the Territory of the Forest of the Forest Inland.
The inflammation of forces and funds is enhanced.
The KGSBU leadership of the Prior Aviation Aviation, which is established on fire, requires the enforcement of the aircraft.
Basiley Medvedev, head of the Aviation Basilea:
The fire of difficult access was found by an aircraft of an An-2 aircraft board on 3 hectares.
The ancient residues are burning on the old burner.
Strengthening of the territory and a crucial decline of more than 45 degrees, the lack of advantages for the creation of fire-free areas creates significances of complexity in dust.
We need a Mi-8 holiday.
The delivery of forces in the Mi-2 aircraft and An-2 airport is very difficult.
After discovering fire on the place of the tushing, four fire-free parasites were operatively sealed.
The main task of specialists is to carry out fire and prepare areas to provide additional forces and fuel means.
In the area of the village of O’Island, there were additional 3 fire decennitors.
As soon as the floor is prepared for the fuel area, the specialists will be transferred to the dust, it is reported on the Pre-Sea Administration Site.
Lenny Henry: My father never took care of me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born in the Imigrants family with Jamaica in Dadley in Midland in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked on the fabric, and they were able.
Henry repeated the "Ray Plastics of Rudy", which is partly partly in the responsibility of his father and has grown from the series of transmission to Radio 4.
Saundreck is a recept and a repa, and the melodie is a lifestyle.
Henri, however, had to go through some difficult memories.
After his mother's death, there was a "much" treatment, but Henry often thinks about his father.
He was very inappropriate.
You never saw him, you just heard his voice, "Stop crying.
Get away from your sister.
Shut up!
I want to look at the cricket.
My elderly brothers Simur and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, talked to him in pab and talked about things such as a bird, a beauty of a cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an insultible guy in the angle, who read the magazine most of my life.
Recently, Henry opened the League Master in Dadley and, despite the conditions were better than in his father's days, he was able to look at what his life would be.
It's a little better there, but it's dark, smooth, labyrinthe depth of the labyrinth with the flames of fire and smoke and dogs.
My father came into the bathroom and just lied there, and you heard him start sing quietly about himself, because he wanted to get away from the leather.
When I came there, I realized that he did this for years and years to give us a question, and I'm gonna appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry went out of the deceived parental love.
My father never cared, he never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom was bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he had not enough.
Can you stop it, "I love you?"
Just stop taking me!
Dad, I have 22!
With Don Frank.
Why don't I come with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still different friends with Frank who's been married 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I come with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had a diabetes.
He was one of what killed her.
So when I was very corrected and I had a diabetes symptom, my doctor said, "You must take a radical measure.
Then I started seriously occupied with fitness, and I also had to sit on a strike diet to get out of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's nice.
Nobody eats a marine.
The change in the carrier tractory of Henry is probably reflected in his nice, shortly stressed place.
Since he received the recognition of the critics for his Otello, he was completely in the theatre.
It followed the "Commission of errors" and then the "Forgets" of August Wilson.
This work is different from sickcomes and comedies, which were an inevitable attribute of its nutritional life.
He started the career when he was 16 and worked on the fabric.
Didgey noted how he was born on the scene, and wrote about it in "New Property".
His television career started in the middle of the seventy years, "I was the only black parent/comic in television for a long time."
He's learned at §.
I had not only to grow in the eyes of PIA, but I had to learn to be an effective machine for the delivery of shots between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on TV, and it was very hard.
Lenny in New Action in 1975
Since his manager had the right to the Black and white shooting show, the program that the people "screwed themselves", Henry discovered what it was in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I guess I want it never to be with me, but I don't regret what I did.
Although it was a strange, valuable sentence, I worked on large areas and learned to work with people.
But what was "the easily recompense of the British television class for years and years" was also "grotesc parenthood on black people".
In representation of the persons who were employed by the Cultural Cultural Cultural in Greece, Henry was working in an alternative comedic project in the eighty.
The first season of Shaw Lenny Henry was translated in 1984, and at the nineteenth, he was like, among other things, the Chef of Geret Blacklock from the "Cheef".
Reklame roles, documents of films, televisions and roles in the film took the ten years of his life, but after it seized BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because you're not a lot of time or relaxation."
There was a series of documental transmissions to Radio 4 called "What's good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
Not saying that I'm learning this in school, and I think it's in many ways the prerogation of the white people of the middle class with the cups and the cups downwards.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we had a transmission interview, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You must try.
Don't worry about it until you know what you're talking about.
Take some of these words in hearing, and you'll understand why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Otello monolog for documental transmission, and he was arrested.
I had a feeling that I could.
Likely, they were corrected.
"This is a serious matter, if you are serious, teaching your text, conduct a little study.
The repetition process was cruel, and I read this five months and months before we set it up.
And she had success.
It seemed that they were waiting for disasters and it didn't happen.
We started the "Commission of Errors".
I suddenly was in the National Theater, and I couldn't believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
The technical failure occurred, and Henry's instinct felt that his business was a time.
"The voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they're doing a computer."
Instead, the register assistant declared that the presentation would be repeated as soon as the problem would be resolved.
I went out of the scene and something in me said, "Oh, praise God."
It's not my obligation.
I can let someone else get out of this.
"You're playing a drink, stay in the role."
Henry in "I forgot" in Daches' theater.
It was hard to learn the text for "Forgets".
Panica is quite useful, she strengthens the muscle.
She's also accepted well, so it was like a sign above, "What's it you have to do?"
He says this, of course, by the GROMOVOL.
So I'm keeping that.
I really like that.
I like to be in the repetitive room.
Instead, Henry still thinks about the comic -- the whole road of conversations overcomes his humor's spending when he starts it, it ends to be born.
I just decided not to work in the stendape because this thing with the receipt of a timely recompense from the full of the strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do this all the time, it can lead to a crap.
I sometimes work at the "Real Epher in Apollo" when I want, but in the main way, I don't get such a pleasure as before.
I'm asking if he's gonna give a turn on the wall.
The pleasure to sit in the room with a register that helps the form of start, middle and end of the road - I don't think I'm ever going to refuse it.
So that's his new place?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's a pleasant party.
You're always talking about a story, and here's a great place for it.
I like stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers State servants to find " invisibles"
Kenya started a biometric register of all public servants in trying to remove the " invisibles" from the Government ' s awareness.
The Governing Declaration shall not be reported to partners who are not registered during the two weeks.
The Government doubts that thousands of people continue to receive payments after they left the public service.
The President of Uhuru Kenya promised to reduce corruption in public structures after the arrival to the authorities in 2013.
The audit audit in the previous year was found that at least $1 million per month is lost by the payment of " invisibles" and other financial deficiencies.
The Government understood that payments continue to be made on bank accounts, even after a person dies or remains in the public service, reporter BBC Vanjama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public officers must appear within two weeks in the identity centres in order to ensure that their data will be collected by a biometric registration procedure, reported in the Governing Declaration.
Anyone who doesn't do this without a reason will be removed from awareness is reported in it.
"This procedure promotes rationalisation of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the knowledge of both levels of the Government - therefore, the issue of " Invisibles", said Anne Waygur, secretary of the Office of Ministers of Planning and structuring of the Government.
Decades of Turkish police are arrested in relation to the " contract" against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey for suspicion in the " negotiation against the Government" reported by the Institutional Agencies.
Police representatives do not have a comment on this information.
Among the detained were 14 high-leaving officers, reported by Hurriet Daily News.
In December last, they participated in the operations for the detection of corruption, which were addressed to the control of the Government, including four Governing Ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested in doubt of the establishment of organised crime grouping and telephone hearing.
The Turkish President Redzep Tayip Erdogan, who was the Prime Minister at that time, determined their actions as part of the measures to be taken against him and other authorities, the Islamic Claire of Fethulah Gulen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine opened their doors on Monday, 1 September.
This day is traditionally a great event for families, and, as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister of Arsenia Jacenicuk took his daughter to school.
There he said to the journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremonie passed not at every school in September first.
There is no peaceful heaven over each part of Ukraine.
We have to go for peaceful heavens.
The whole Ukraine, a large Ukrainian national front, must be held for peaceful heavens.
Alexan Pastuch, director of the school in Slovakia, where the daughter of Jacenicuk went, spoke Russianly.
We hope that the world will end up here and that children will receive knowledge that will be in their next life.
The first day of learning, traditionally, are noted that children put up the rubbers, hold the aircrafts in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhed BBC, she may have found such an incredible rue that she needs.
For her and for her slave shepherds from the world of the banking business, the management of the MMEs and the Internal Parties of Tory.
In fact, she has its own experience of work on staff.
Her career started in a consulting company on the global Bain and Co management, and then continued to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the world of MMI in Pearsons.
She was a member of the Financial Times for seven years, and went to the department when the high post in the Pearson's company took a colleague-man who had a lower position.
They say it's about £1 million.
Its political review is also read.
She recommended David Kquaron Lord Brown, an ex-Chapter of BP, when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector to Whitehall: she became advisor of the Minister's office.
She's her ex-consultator, Tory.
Before in May, I called the president of the cockpit.
BBC is not only a huge and complexity in the heart of the public life, but there is a internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: inside as a level of administration of the BBC's own, but I also express as a voice of public concern and anxiety when something is wrong.
It's almost uncomfortable duopolation, which is a full radical resistance.
However, the new president will risk the arrival, the accommodation and disruption of the institution as difficult as the Chinese dynamic if it is to stop work in this process.
It's a difficult solution.
It would not be so difficult, but many people would be happy to see how BBC will be reduced, after reviewing its powers, financial and status.
Since competitors are increasingly increasingly increasing and new output technologies, unsecure negotiations on the value of licence represent a danger for BBC.
For a small amount of £145,50 per year, britains have a share in the world's largest media undertaking.
The BBC reports a good story: it states that the results of its work include 96 per cent of households and cost each of them only 40 p per day.
Moreover, it is evident that the population of Beeb is supported by 53 per cent today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
BBC's models have changed: I now get new headers on the phone and see iPlayer's iPlayer's missing programs.
But it remains very popular and innermost institutions.
He needs an extraordinary president-- I hope he's found it.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating movement was written to someone outside
Twitter from the subcontracted account of the Governor Texas of Rick Perry, on Sunday evening, contained the design of a democratic environmental prosecutor, located in the centre of a voting persecution for the misuse of the authority.
The Twitter was later removed and followed another of the Perry accounts in which the record was debugged.
Only from my account, a twice that was written to someone outside.
"I don't approve this ticket, and I've removed it," reports a more light record.
Perry's assistants have not been responsible for commenting.
Although the records were threatened by Perry's account, it was not clear who actually worked in this band.
The earlier movies contained an unleavened carrier to the prosecutor of Travis Rosmery Lamberg, who recognized the offence in the state of commitment in April 2013.
Perry prohibited its knowledge when she had been released, which led to the understanding of a major jury in Austria this month against Perry, which was a potential candidate in the president for elections in 2016.
The signature in your own states: "I'm not always running a car in the situation of drinking, three times above the allowable level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do it, I'm proclaiming the guvernor Perry's accusation of what he's talking to me about."
I'm the most drunk democratic in Texas.
Lamberg's news did not investigate with a major jury against Perry.
They were employed by Michael Crum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by the judge-resp.
Perry did not recognize himself as a guilty and called a political charge.
His powerful legal team requested the Court of Justice to reject the accusation act, stated that the law used for the persecution of the Governing Board, who is responsible for all over the history of Texas, would discover that the constitution would be contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped the employment of $7,5 million from the State State State Control Department, based on Travis circonscription, and followed the corruption in the public sector of Texas when Lemberg was released.
Veto has issued an official complaint from the group of public controls with left views.
The Lenta under the account of Perry is often updated - and sometimes it becomes known.
When the fifth party arrived in Iowa during its presidential campaign in 2012, Perry answered to hearing that he could go out of the game, split a twitter with hisself running near the ocean, and said, "This is we, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the insecurity market has returned to "normal status"
One of the most responsibility officers of London warned that the market in the South-East England was " returned" to the normal level of activity.
The house in the capital was the subject of a survived question and an efficient price, and the fear that the credit puzzle would take place in the Bank of England in order to establish hypothetic interests in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgeley, the manager and president of the Berkeley Elite Building Company, said, "So the beginning of the current financial year, the market returned to the normal level of transition from 2013," added that it provided a "stable slave environment".
Londry's insurance market has overcome during the fall, since foreign purchasers have gone to the chair.
The prices in the town were highlighted by 18,5 per cent for only one last year, according to the Agricultural Castle, with an average indicator of 6,7 per cent for England and Wales in total.
The average market prices for private, available and student schemes of Berkeley have increased around one five in the past year, at the end of April £423000.
However, the strengthening of the pound in the past months has made London lavere disturbance for foreign purchasers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new taxes for insurance and political ritories around the potential "payment on the ́soon" before the general elections in May.
The London Foxtons Insurance Agency last week warned that the April re-marketing of the hypothetic market, which introduced more heavy conditions for supply, would also lead to the reduction of market growth as a sale of unnecessary sales as well as prices in the second half of the year.
The fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed the fall of the number of approved hypothectic interests in June, which provides further cold on the rail market.
Hamptons International, another insufficiency agency, reduced its prediction of the increase in prices for London involving 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis of the decreasing prices for insecurity already started to be weak.
The amount of transitions at the time has the fourth comparison to the previous year in the lowest regions of London, such as Chelsea, Mayer and Kencington, according to the information of the WA Ellis Agency.
Nevertheless, the question at the chair was very favourable for Berkeley, taking up the sale of over 2,2 billion billion.
Mr. Pidgeley added: "A question of the goods needed with a good design and best place remained old and, reflecting this, the sales were kept for a time."
In June, the company reported that 3742 new houses were sold in this year before the end of April - nearly for the third more than in the 2007 dogrise pig.
The annual income of taxes was increased by 40 per cent compared to £380 million in the previous year, and the income was $18 per cent to €1,6 billion.
By speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgeley reported that the proposed incomes of Berkeley would comply with the current market expectations for this year.
According to the single analysis, the arrival of £450 million is expected for a year before the payment of taxes.
The value of Berkeley's action was held at $23,96 in the second half day on the London bargain.
Photos found by Jennifer Lawrence are held on the Internet by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence comes to the 85th ceremonie of the annual American cine academy premium.
The photographs of Jennifer Lawrence's attorney, which received the "Oscar Premium", were published on the Internet by hacker, which assured that the "catalog" contains 100 more upcoming stars.
The representative of the "Fearly Games" star confirmed that Lawrence's graphics were true and condemned the hacker for the "increasing income in the private space".
The right-guarding bodies have been conducted, and they will persecute any who will describe the stolen graphs of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos that were significantly issued on the 4chan exchange site, probably received by the lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the "catalog" of the victims of the bullet includes the names of a duty of women's names, including Rianna, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Cate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
Not clearly, how many of these graphs are, even though the "Scott Pilgrim" stars against all" Winsted in your owner also condemned the exhibition.
"The one who looks at the graphs we've made with his husband a few years ago, getting home -- I hope you're fierce," wrote Winsted in Twitter.
However, Victoria Jastis from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria-Victoria-Victory" reported that she was on the graphs, in Twitter, "These are those called me FALSCHIVKY, people.
Let's put it in the ship.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the pop star of Aryana Grande did what it would probably have done.
Exclusive exhibition from the new Romanian Howard Jamesson on the love and letter "J", who called the crystals
They dissolved, better say exactly so, they gradually disappeared as a carton box that they left under the rain.
Only sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, hard in society, stressed, closed, and maybe a little troubled.
And then she took his hand.
He's seen anger in himself.
He's been kidding like an egg, yes.
The last victim of this cold was a small romance from which he had been waiting more than usually, freedom from the single and nice life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Alynn Solomons was a tremendous splendid beauty with the wounded hair and the heart of the northern island village, even remote and harder than Port Royben.
She came to the south with the age of herself, which Kevern considered her teth, and then received her home in sugar, but looked like the valley's paradise called "Ray valley".
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The tissues of the tissues, in the bathrooms, lay their tracks on all the windows that are sure that the house belongs to them; the garden grows like the gigant cockpits.
It seemed to be a cottage from the book of the IA, at the same time a fearful and fascinating, with a full secret garden.
Review of the author: Howard Jamesson, whose role "J" is included in the list of booker's premiums in 2014.
Shoot list will be published at a week
Kevern and Eilin were sitting at hands, in the wounded shields among the high grass, enjoying unexpectedly warmth day; they were both distressingly connected to a rain console that made the country of peacemakers and relaxing news when, looking at her baptized root feet, he remembered the old song of a forgetted black artist, who loved listening to his father, leaving the stones in the house.
You have too big feet.
Because of their agressivity, such songs on the console were no longer played.
They were not prohibited, nothing was forbidden, but they were not played anymore.
They helped them to become archaetic as the word "Available".
The community's cuss did what could never be achieved by givings and prescriptions, and as among the books, people chose the memories of rich people who were growing in poverty, culinary books and loving romans, they were electing balls.
On this day, Kevern was accepted to play in a fortepion and a shout of comic voice to sing a big foot of Eilin.
Aline didn't understand.
"This was a pope's song of jazz's pianoist, whose name was Fates Waller," he said to her, "masterly applied two fingers to the mouths.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she was going out of his mouth.
It started from the game they played when he was small.
His father played in her with his father as he told him.
Start the word with "J", forgetting to apply two fingers to the mouth, and it'll be your penny.
It wasn't a very fun game at that time, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew he was waiting for it, all of it.
He had to explain what it was.
Aline never heard him.
Jaz wasn't playing, even though he wasn't openly prohibited.
Improvization came out of the mode.
There was only one place in life if.
When the melodie started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's exactly the same.
His inappropriateness was made to people in the middle of the world.
And Jaz was an ostroum expressed by the help of the Jez.
Although he had reached 10 years of age and had never heard about David's Youth, Kevern knew about a jazz from a half secret collection of disks.
But at least he didn't have to tell Aylin that Fetts Waller was black.
Having regard to her age, she almost remembered the time when the pope songs were not black.
There is no law or pressure again.
The Community was obedient, and it means that each of its segments agreed with thanksgiving to those who have been judged with the principle of the group prevention.
The people of Afro-Karibi's origin on temperature and physical characteristics well under the area of dilution and divorce, and they sang and fled.
Indostan's outcome, as if they were talentable in all that was electronic, took it for no family to stay without the phone.
What was left from the Poland diaspore was worked in synthetic works; what remained from Greek was a tarel.
The outcomes from the Persian Valley and Levant whose grandparents did not strive to leave the country when the THAT THAT IS AND WHAT IS IT IS IS, feared that they would be accused of burning the flame, in fear, particularly saying that the flame would cover them, opened the restaurants with the labs and the calyans, and they were not covered and covered.
Everyone by the ability.
Since she had heard just the balls before, Eilin was difficult to understand how about the words that Kevern had just cut her, they could be put on.
Music is the expression of love.
"They're not really about it," Kevern said.
Maybe for people who have big feet.
My father never did anybody, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could occur through the sound isolation of gigant papers like the cave.
Aline didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a fucking shit, but he didn't want to take two fingers up with her again.
She's already considered it strange.
"He seemed funny," he said instead.
She's uncertain until Kever's review.
There was nothing over the world except the throat of her black hair.
Nothing he wants to look at.
"Well, if you say that," she said, staying at her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you eat it to me.
It seemed to be really disgusting.
Do I have too big feet?
He looked at them again.
Not to say, no.
The ships may be almost...
And you're saying you hate me because my bottles are too crazy?
Did I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you just because you've got a stomach box," he tried to tell you instead.
I've got an exciting.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts often led him to a disagreement, because, as a father, he missed the calamity that could be mixed by the violentness of the wounds.
Maybe his father wanted to be violent.
Maybe he, Kevern, would.
Despite good eyes.
Alynn Solomons rose up and rose up from the scarlet, broke the console and broke the wine that they drinked.
The wine from the wallet, so the cup couldn't serve him as a correction.
In her anxiety, she seemed to be able to stick like palms in the rubber.
"And I like you just because you're stupid," she said...
Although you don't like it.
He was sorry for her, and because of the excessive deepness of his words, and because of the fear that she appeared in her view when she gave him an opposition.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on a cold northern architecture, where she was growing, but he did not doubt that in the main shields she was like a coach.
The same big ice ocean was on them both.
The same faced with such men, even more sensitive and caprible after that, if it was able to be able to take up the hands of any woman that would have disappointed them or disappointed them.
You stupid?
They would have shown her a stupid cup if she hadn't been worth.
The dream would be deceived, now, by the most usual expression of the irritation between man and woman; against the pressing balllades that the console had issued to cure it and then to hit it.
More accurately, Kevern's opinion, because he's been humid.
Aline Solomonz's boat that he needs to leave.
He got up out of the rock as an old man.
She felt soft, but the weight of her worse surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the light.
They eat knowing another.
She looks on how he goes and from the window looks like it goes out, her partner is a man who has a weakness on herself.
Adam, who left the garden, thought about it.
She felt a part of compassion with him and men, even though some of them were raised up to her hand.
The man who turned away from her, with a shameful, concealed, disappointed, all the ability to fight him - why was she seen that she knew so well if she could not remember any case until today she had seen that?
Another Ealyn Solomons looks at his feet.
For twenty years before the events described above, or about Esme Nusbaum, a smart and energy trial of 32 years that worked in Ofnau, a nearly-of-of-Office control service, prepared a small report on the maintenance of a low and medium-term violence level in the most parts of the country, where it was expected to be reduced if it was not completely, taking into account the means and forces which were made for it and exercising it.
"That has been done, and much is done," she wrote, "to reduce the expected aggressiveness of people who were fighting in thousands of wars and gained most of them, especially among those satted flowers and low-speaking abilities, where, despite the harvests of the Church, the unnecessary spirit of the goodness of the Church was rarely feeling about the whole history.
However, some of the qualities appear that they are not.
Better than the spile, it seems to be the lower of the things he is born.
The population slides over sensible ballades, strikes the stories of overcoming obstacles and announces its low faith in marriage and family life, but not only the old deepness keeps its strong dust as well as in rural communities, as in citizens, but also the fact that a new and bad destruction is born in houses, in slavery, in roads, and even in game areas.
"You have too much advantage of writing," said her scientist rue, reading the whole report.
I think you should read less romans.
Esme Nusbaum was missing.
I should also ask you: Are you atheist?
"I don't think it's worth answering," Esme Nussbaum answered.
Are you lesbian?
Asme had the right to life and silence again.
Feminist?
Repeat the silence.
"I'm asking," said Luther Rabinoviz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
There's no warning here.
We are a society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and comfortable in themselves, may sometimes deteriorate the results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously, you are most surprised against the Church and what you call "mal" and "groups", others would be interpreted as a expression of natural life - and energy.
Continue to ask about what has happened, if you're going to get out, as if it happens, if it happens, yesterday, it means to lose the country of the necessary life force.
Esme Nusbaum looked on the sides while Rabinovic spoke.
Following his rose, like flamingo, light letters repeated the advice that "Ofnau" gave to the country the last fourth century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your wife, listen to the balls, to the music, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, excuse.
Talk better silence, word songs better than the written word, but there is nothing better for love.
"I completely understand what you want to say," Esme Nusbaum replied quietly when she confirmed that her scientist's runner had finished to say, "and I don't want to say anything except that we were not treated so effectively as we win ourselves.
I fear that if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that have brought to the TOMAY, WHAT TO BE TO BE TO TO BE TO BE TO TO BE TO THAT.
Only this time we'll put our wrath and unbelieving in others.
Luther Rabinovic joined the fingers of the fingers in the piramide.
This gesture had to mean unfinished patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "that's called "faults" of actions that our grandfather did or did not.
You're going too far, and when you're talking about that they've cast their "irm" and "infidelity" to "Others".
You should not need a person to remember that by understanding the past, we are not talking about "and" and "they".
There was no "we" or any other.
It was the time of the devil, that's all we know.
"Where, if you are honest with yourself," it was deceived to add to Esme, "no one of the society can be justified well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done, it was done.
Then it was.
Nothing else needs to say, we're here.
And as we don't have to blame anyone, we don't have to be justified if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why is the past, if not to learn?
It's the past to forget it.
If I can add one word to this--
The piramidde Luther Rabbinica was devastated.
"I'll consider your report," he said, "laying it.
On the day, on the road, it was shot by a moto, which went out to the treaty, as described "in bad anger".
Coincidences occur.
The Army of Lesoto states that the conversion is not planned; the Prime Minister remains in the South
The representatives of the army of Lesoto have made the preparation of a conversion to the Government's commitment, stated that they were against the police that were understood in trying to enhance politicians.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country by claiming that the army of the country had surrounded its official residence and took Government opinions in the capital of Maser.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbor of Southern, stated that it had been a threat to his life.
The representative of the Army Major Ntoi stated that there was not actually a turn, but that the army of the reaction to the threat of "political vaticums" that the police tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Lesoto Armed Forces Command adopted a number of reports on the fact that there are some elements that are actually planning to enhance some political, young political parties who were ready to build a chaos," he reported to the America's vote.
The representative of the South African Government Clayson Mong stated that the military action looked like a turnover.
"If no one has presented a claim to the authorities with power, according to all the information that lesoto's armed forces have the main characteristics of the conversion," he said.
The representatives of the army of Lesoto reported that the soldiers returned to the catarrm on Sunday and that it was quiet in the capital.
At the same time, the Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing managed by the Government without Taban.
Tabane stated that he believed that the attacks were subjected to an attempt to cope with corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesoto was completely stressed since June when Tabane stopped the parliamentary sessions in its United Government.
He stated that the Government had not been distorted, despite the reckoning in return.
"Chelsy" Marko van Ginkel will take a current season on the rights of the arends in Milan," reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year Netherlands will come to Italy in the next hour for medical investigation.
In the past season, he went out to the field in the composition of the London club only three times.
It's the fact that Milan's earlier arranged at the Liverpool of Fernando Torres' attack.
Production in the area of the lowest indicator in 13 months
The growth of production in the zone was reduced to the lowest indicator within 13 months in August, according to the population of the investigation.
The latest importance of the business activity index (PMI) of the marketing sector was fallen to 50.7 in August from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
The new orders were detained, and the undertakings suffered the pressure between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The values were made before the assembly of the Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The bank will wait for a clear plan to cope with the rest of the zone's restoration, as well as with a threat of deflation on inflation, which consists of only 0.3 per cent.
There is a chance that the ECB-room Mario Dragi later this week may give additional signals that he considers a quantity mixture scheme similar to those represented by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the intensity effect of the economic and geopolite's indefinition of producers becomes more evident," said Rob Dobson, the older economyist Markit.
The PMI of Germany’s productive sector, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, has fallen to the lowest than 11 months of note 51.4.
At the same time, in the second period of the economy block, France, the PMI fell up to 46.9.
France continues to cause true concern as well as the weakness of Italy from stabilised growth to stagnation.
The indication that the impulse of growth of gas in the main industrial engine, Germany and Spain and the Netherlands does not add confidence, said Mr. Dobson.
The injury of industriality, most likely, will still increase oil in fire to analytical analyses expecting the introduction of additional monetary or budgetary stimulation.
One town news was from Ireland, where IMI grows up to 57.3, its highest level since 1999.
Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight Economy, said, "It's the best to say about the August research of the business activity in the productive sector, that it shows that the sector still exists."
He added, "Producers of zones, obviously, find a very hard life at this point, since the current adult geopolite pressure - especially Russia/Ukrainian - adds inadequate conditions in many countries.
This growing pressure, obviously, has affected business - especially consumer's confidence, and probably leads to some orders to be arrested or even cancelled, especially major orders.
He said "all more like it" that the ECB, finally, would have to make a variety of quantity mixtures, "We understood that it would be possible."
Mariupol's residents will make a pipe against the people
In Mariupol, the last week before, there was peace - no one was able to organize the Mariupolis people's resistance, the city lived and worked on the Asian Sea.
Now the inhabitants expect the coming of the "foldmen".
According to Politologists, separatists are going to Mariupol to go out to the Asian Sea - the city of Novoazsk was recently taken, which had not yet been income in the sum of self-declared repositories.
The Mariupolis decided that the Ukrainian army, even though it would protect them, had a little power against the greatly armed representatives of the DNA-LNR, and were gathered to help military.
They run eye, build blocks and strengths.
On Saturday, a few thousand people came to the east border of the city, and they arose there in a cup with the wheat of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the case of the commitment.
The volunteers collect and carry up and carry out and collect medicines, publish the newspaper.
In the town, stores are gradually closed, interrupted by banks and banknotes.
Ten years of age for the survival of Beslan: Ten years of a wretching school, like children who have been in it, suffering until these days
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken in the Czech campaigns in the Beslan School, South Russia
More than 330 persons, more than half of them, were killed during this three-day experience, which was throughout the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied to death during the beast in the school.
Before ten years after a terrible deceased school, 334 people died, including 186 children, heavy overleaving disasters warned about the new apocalipsy in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, islamians, arrested and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new fourth, it seemed to be something like an extreme degree of possible.
The tragedy united the east and the west in the turn, which then wonderfully increased in the future's hope and hope in the conditions of a worst harm.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan south of Russia to find some of the victims who lied to death during the beast in the school.
We have discovered wonderful young people who opposed disasters, although the memories of terrorism will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
What the war that now disturbs Ukraine, where children like they are dead, will now stop.
A girl who is trying to go back to the shooting room
It was printed on the picture of the Russian Dmitry Belakov's photograph, when she tried to return to the shooting chair after the mine explosion.
In the distress, Ida was desperately looking for her mother, Larisus, who now was 40.
There were fears that both of them were dead, but they were actually survived.
"The woman told me to flee from all the powers, but I couldn't," Ida said.
My feet were covered with blood.
I arose and went back in to find my mother.
The soldier took her and brought her to a safe place.
After operations, she thought she was completely restored, but last night she said, "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I can need more operations.
There's a few bills left in my tribe.
Her goal is now to be dancist, to help people as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed life, but she, of course, didn't break it," she says with a call.
"This happened to me, and it changed this fact.
Once a year, I'm always going to this elective room to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying to not talk about it in other days.
It's too much pain.
My best friend who had to be my classmates, Dera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and we thought we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I'm finished teaching and start working.
I'll submit to the family later.
She says that the arrest remains with her, although the memory is a little tough every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so thankful for the help we have received from people from the United Kingdom and all over here.
When I see the Internet graph, where I go to school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, know about our tragedy and do so that it doesn't happen.
The boy who fled through the town of the pool, thinking his mother's dead
It was his first day in the school (Russians begin to learn in school for 7 years) and overleaving three days of arrest by taking their mother Tamar.
Then he had seven, and he said, "Mammy said to me to cure if he was explosed, and to keep her in the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dead.
She said to him, "Be back."
When he was afraid that she was dead, he fled and saw a crying boy on the road, put the baby in his hand and fled through the city of a pool.
His father, Vladimir, who made his son abroad, said, "Damir said to me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I can't save her."
In fact, Tamar was free and was in the hospital with the foot-up hurt, thinking that her son was dead.
After their meeting, she said, "I wept from joy.
I couldn't believe that.
He fled and took me.
Damira later brought it to London (the news of the World) where he was rewarded as the Protector of Children from Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This fear comes back to you every day, but I would like to stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
I can still say he's in my memory.
I remember the strike after that, I've cut all my fucking weapons out.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and it's not a problem for me.
"I don't care to return to that elective room, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids with whom I played in the court that didn't choose.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they're staying in a spectacular room.
I remember the road in London so well, especially a game store, where I have been allowed to choose everything I want, and run into a car with an open.
But now he fears for places such as Ukraine, where wars lead to such bitterness that he and his friends have survived.
This horrible thing comes back to you every day, but I'd like to stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these terribles," said Damire, who was working a volunteer in a woman's monastery last week.
I want to help that way.
I want to serve in the police once and hope that I will be in the school academy in the year.
His mother Tamar, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our apartment, can you make yourself?
I remember the yellow silence after the arrest, there were only no children who would cry and run around, and this silence continued a lot of months.
She's quite remembering her travel with Damire in London.
People in London wept when I told the story.
I realized how people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings can give support.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her fund for that reward and to go to London in 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meet her and her husband in London and how they helped Damire and me.
I remember when Damire wanted to eat a fight, they called all the Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with officers in the restaurant, Damire shot them out of his water gun, and they fled and played with him.
And the month passed after our cosmar then.
I was thinking that the britains were so ready to divide the pain and support us.
She said, "I think this world isn't better than these 10 years.
Now in Ukraine and war, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
It's just the same kids as ours.
I think for many people of war is a new report that they listen when they are sorrowly or when they are busy.
I just know what these people feel, it's terrible.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing changed, people still want to kill one another, and it's so crazy.
Damire has grown up and is a very mild and quiet boy, he is not agressive or bad.
He doesn't look for places, for example, he's not for the past cosmar.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they're going to a spectacular room of time and burning the lights there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember he was leaving on the wheel, turning away from us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he has cast all his weapons and other military games.
I'm trying to believe that a few hours I was so sure he died and that I'm never gonna see him anymore.
When I was thrown up from the explosion and stood up on my feet, I looked, and I saw around myself when parts of the body were lying around.
I was absolutely sure that it wasn't worth my little boy to survive in this hole.
"I remember I'm throwing to him, "Damire, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and fled.
This is the way life continues for us, in contrast with so many others.
Georgia Ilin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking graph has been determined for the tragedy in Belarus
Room: About Beslan Georgia Ilin and his mother Fatima after the arrest in 2004, and the right of Georgia today
On his bloody face, it was a print of fear when he was saved from death when the Czech terrorists shot his fellow classmates.
His description was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarity in Beslan.
His mother, 54 years old, the chief doctor, brought him to school on the first day of learning before taking the older son of Vladimir to the university.
"I left in two minutes before the terrorists fled into the court, so my little boy remained one for three days of the cosmar," she recalled.
Not alone, there was the family of our family, but all of them were killed.
Only my Georgia was able to survive.
As close to this date, it's more difficult to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't have what it was a long time, I think that it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days I have all the time before my eyes.
No one will never forget, I promise you.
The graph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of attack and was always increased in sculpture (right)
I remember that George wanted to go to school on the day that he said he wanted to cover the teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's a sculpture of Georgia weeping in San Marino.
Georgia doesn't like to look at this graph, and she's hidden in a book shadow with us home.
I understand, but I also know that through this graph, people worldwide feel pain.
George says now, "It's probably not going to happen anymore.
"I guess we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they are investigating the Boing circumcision in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what she was called?
This world and something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, as it happens?
Ten years are nothing for such a pain.
We need to go for a few years to forget her.
She affected my health, and I still feel her.
About three or four years, I've been dreaming for the arrest, but now it's been better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very lucky every day.
I'm talking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I continue to go to this hotel before 1 September.
I want to remember my old friends.
I'm hard to go into a spectacular room, but I have to do that.
I don't feel victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget that, but I'm not trying a trial to me.
My life continues.
I had a school this year and had been at the Medical University of Vladikakakaka.
I'm gonna learn to become a cardiochirurg.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be military, but the health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for the country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Farney, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite what was in the foot of a terrorist murderer
Incredible: Georgia Farneyov was located at the feet of a terrorist murderer while he was arrested, but he was able to survive
When he was arrested, he was photographed in a elective room sitting near a bomb at a terrorist killer's feet.
Actually, it's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We're saying that it was still yesterday," says Georgia, who wanted to learn at the FSB divorce officer, but not because of the damage that caused his health during the arrest.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easy to cope with bad events, I must say that it's wrong.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a lot better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the year was the first and last time I entered the chair again.
I lost my conscience.
I'd never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting on this graphy.
Survivor: Georgia Farneyov today opened on the notebook in the hospital after arrest
My pain is big, and I'll carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
What's going on in the condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be cautious to the gentleman who was hurt, but now I'm okay.
But the health did not allow me to learn in the FSB academics in Sankt Peterburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical conclusions, and they replied that it was not.
My second use was animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I've been studying there two years.
He's learning to treat all animals from the bottle to the bowls.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my responsibility.
This is not what children should know, and, of course, not what they have to survive.
His mother, 42 years old, said, "This pain will never leave me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes.
I'll go and attend the ceremonies that will be carried out to notify it.
I know George doesn't eat.
For him she must be more able, because he was there, and I don't.
I was waiting for him home and I couldn't help.
I'm so thankful to God that he returned to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgia is now adult, but this cosmar is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something's so bad injustice happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sport, but he can't take care of them for a tribe.
He had a few operations, he could walk, but he couldn't work.
I would say he'd overcome this cosmar for 50 per cent, but it's not worth to overcome and forget it.
This bitter experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the arrest, and this only strengthens pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were my ways.
My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could do to me, but my heart pains for those who were killed.
I know the family where new children were born, but I know the widows who never married anymore.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want.
I'm never gonna forget how the heart of the throat was from my breast at the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what happens in the world, wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why are they killing one another?
War is very close to our country now, and I'll believe that I'm trying to believe it.
We were a friend country in the past, how did we fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and they'll be killed.
If you could take all upstairs and throw out, it's as far as possible.
Allena Scoeva, 10 years old
A young man who triggered to a safe place of shock
Saving: Allena Scaeve is taking a safe place in Russian speechnaza (left).
Now he has ten (right) and he does not remember the wonderful crime.
The peace stopped breathing in 2004, when the small Allen took hands from the injured school in Beslan the Russian police.
The terrorists left her, but she was violently left her 30-year-old mother, Christian sister and Brother Mahar in the school room.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was rescued, but the mother and sister of Allen were killed in a dead battle.
Her father Russan was married again, and with his new wife, Sweetlana, they have a little daughter who he called Christina in the memory of the daughter he lost.
Allena, who now is ten, doesn't remember the arrest and flow in a smart and life - pleasant girl, speaks to the neighbors.
"They're a great happy family now, and Allen and Mahar are both children," says a close friend.
Russian is a beautiful father and wants to keep them far from all memories when the tenth anniversary is noted.
You might understand why.
Sindsy Kagawa, who returned from Manchester Younaite to the Dormouse Boss, noted that he was in patience when he was able to go back to the field in the form of German club.
According to his words, this transfer is a pleasant event in the career.
Of course, I'm very glad that I will play again for "Borusia", says the picture of the word of Kagava.
I feel very good.
A full of local emotions and awaiting illness when I'm going to go out again in Burusia's form.
At the same time, Kagawa passed to "MU" from "Borusia" in 2012 by 16 million.
However, he could not be strengthened in the composition of the English club by carrying only 38 mads in the England campion, killing 6 bottles and delivering 8 resulting transfers.

Obama, Mercel and Oland do not open in Vladivostoka
The Duty Free Airport Magazine has made a table that prohibits purchase in this store a number of world political leaders.
Don't reverse them with spirits, waters, and horses.
The Business Administration decided that the President Barak Obama, the officer of Frg Ang, Merkel, President of France France Oland, Vitaly Klikko, Julia Timoschenko, Prime Minister of Japan and a number of other companions would not be able to turn away with water, horse and spirits in their store.
And I've cut the corresponding table on the door.
Previously, Obama had been prohibited to appear in a less accessible type of service for the Digital Boards, which reported the company's site.
Whether the American president of the mind had ever feeded in the dictators in Russia, not, but the prohibited authors have seemed to be extremely obscure.
Should there be sugar after `bargo: Medidav's advice to the agrarians
The Prime Minister for Russian Dmitri Medvedev believes that in the conditions of the Russian agraries, new technologies should be enhanced in order to set up the exhibition of the oxygen buyers.
The Council was given during the visit of the "Yugpticeprom" firm "Agrocom ́x".
The Government Chapter also provides the responsibility of the Restaurants to reorient the Russian meat which is at the level of debt.
Annual `bargo for trade imports was introduced to Russia since 7 August.
The main training trainer of Valentin Maslakov of the DecaNation tournament has been satisfied.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result in the lack of a targeted preparation for Implementation.
Our sportsmen expressed themselves at their level -- it adds "This sport" to the words of Maslakov.
The third place is to be a sufficient high level of command.
It is pleased that the benefit of French and even Americans over us is minimal.
We should consider that we have not been prepared for this.
The season is closed, and we did not commit our leaders to participate in DecaNation cat.
In the past years, we became the second tour, but we have been renewed in this season.
Instead, the French have issued a Boespeaker, including 13 campioners.
They did not hide their ability to win this year, which they were publicly announced.
But even such a number of householders had not been able to resist Americans.
Therefore, I believe that growth has been expressed at a good level in such a competitive company.
But the results in some kinds were in order below than the British League.
Sezon closed.
Of course, the sportsmans are not so important, but more important in the executions of the command level.
The main thing here was a place.
The results of the absurdity occurred when 1500 m men were so touched by the taktic hitroplaids of the run that showed the result of the average level of women's refugees.
4 suggestions how to get the best quality of subwater photos and videos
If you want to graph or film video under water, you have a whole range of device options before you.
The most deep alternative is the water-production "mile", for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or exhne camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which is sold about $300.
I made these photos at a family party using several machines, all about $350.
Unless you use the equipment, several rules must be observed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a water-production camera, you will make sure that the camera battery and other cameras are permanently closed.
Furthermore, configure your camera for the type of graphs or videos you're going to record.
Some of the videocamers have a seed or type of object that optimize the exhibition for deteriorated subwaters.
And before you get into water, you know how deep your equipment can be lost.
The camera is calculated by only 5 feet, other than 50 or 60 feet.
See our guide for the buyer and rating of digital cameras and for traditional and water-free models.
Take a few pictures because many of them do not get.
There's a CCD that will help you to compose photos, while the EXH-camer usually doesn't have them.
Even if you have a CCD, it will be difficult to look under water, and the composition of the frame will be a accidental process.
So do a few pictures.
Also, if your camera has a series-summing regime that grabs a few frames with a few different exhibitions, please consider them.
Leave in the surface.
The quantity of light is decreased in the depth of the water.
If it is possible, stay at the surface when you film in the baseline, the river or the ocean.
This will also allow you to translate more colors on graphics; the deepest you will leave, the less color you will see.
Get closer to the objects of the seed.
It's a great advice for sush, but it's still more important under water because of the lights that are cut off.
Especially important if you are filming the camera: This device is often based on a fixed, wide angle line, which means that you need to draw close to the objects of the seed if you want to fill the frame.
The Bridge of the Olympics Games in 2012 for free fighting Bill Mahov can go to the Greek and Roman fight.
This has been reported by the main trainer of the Congregation of Dagestan on the free fight against Sajid Sajid.
The Specialist did not exclude the participation of sportsmen in the peace chambers in Tashkente in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently located on the assembly of the "classics" team, "R-Sport" says Sajid Sajid.
In fact, the Bill's officers also expressed both styles.
At the early early 2005 world, he was a volunteer tourist and a third prisoner in Greek-Roman ' s commitments and decided to determine free fighting.
For a long time, the new stage of his career will lead to the Greek and Roman fight.
I'm going to say more, Mahov can already be on the world campion in Tashkente - if he wins a breakfast.
But the resolving word is always on the train stab in the head of Gogie Coguashville.
Andrew Lawson was such a person whose power of person could be able to enlarge all around, even in a gigantic organization such as the National Health Service.
A consulting anestesiologist, he dedicated his career to deliver the disease and suffering from the disease and from the pain of treatment.
Among those who turned to him mentioned his wife, he was a MI-6 officer who had to live with disruptive consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while the doctor was diagnosed and diagnosed, those who were treating, mainly, fearing something else is pain.
Once in 2007, however, he proved to those who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like usually," he wrote in May last year.
I was hard to find strength in me.
He's fighting the symptoms like the grip, he's discovered that he's disturbing his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything to happen faster than later," he noticed.
When Juliet went to work on Sunday, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unintelligently disappointed.
Something was wrong.
He asked the college to make a breast cell ring.
Two weeks ago, he was caught on the beaches in the French Alpha.
Rentgen's results came.
It was a mezotelium, an unleavened cancer that cares of the powder, or a cloud of the cups.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find out the exact reason.
Although some kidneys are infected with cancer, for example, not all of the cancer of fuels.
But with the mezotel else.
Almost in all cases, the reason is to contact asbest, a volonic building material, which sometimes was called "a miracle" but which, as now, is deadly dangerous.
For most of us, mezotelium is a disease that can not be taken into account.
Asbest, finally, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbest is not used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial prohibition has entered into force.
Even when he was discovered, only individuals of specific adults worked in close contact with him: tube isolators, builders, bodies and docks, for example.
The industry is from another period, whether it seems to be a reason for anxiety today.
But such calmness is wrong.
Greece seems to be on the pique of mezotelium epidemy today.
More people die here than mezotelium than any other country on the planet.
At the annual level, about 2500 persons, more than two times more people die from this disease than by car accidents.
Annual number of mezoteliums since 1980 and the prognosed number of →s in the future in Britain
The reason for which we feel his consequences now is that, although the use of asbest has been anti-legal for many years (all types of asbest were finally prohibited by the law in 1999), the mezoteliums are usually decades to develop.
And the attack of the mezotelium is not a special veterinarian building.
Asbest was, and in many cases it remains based on the house where we live, the offices where we work, schools where we learn, and stores where we are purchasing.
As a result, the mezotelium does not take attention to the class, level of sufficientity, profession or age.
Bastions of devotion, from modern London universities to private schools, as seemed to be not salvation.
With the parliament, the asbest was dismissed.
Even the hospitals designed to treat us were the reserves of this `carcerogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a fucking isolator.
In particular, he had to think where he could contact the asbest.
Then he made it.
"It seems that there could have been a lot of asbest in tonnels in the Gay hospital, where I had been six years on the stage," he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors, and carriers were using these tonnels.
Interestingly, how many of my companions will have the same disease?
It was a question on which, desirablely, he could give a part of the answer.
"From the four doctors in the Gay hospital and who later developed mezotelium in the last five years," he noted in his letter in 2010, "I was one alive."
How many of us will suffer this disease?
Andrew Lawson was given the "mezotelium diagnose" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, 17 February this year, he was 55.
To live so long.
Fifty per cent of disease mezoteoem died in 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always lucky.
So now we can just ask Louson, "How many of us will have the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, the leading expert on Mesotelium in Greece, most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050, when an assessing epidemie in the United Kingdom must survive, about 90,000 people will die.
The majority now do not imagine that they will die so.

The rapid review of the reports from the courts where the suffering is often subject to compensation shows how far the attack of the mezotelium has been spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that, unfortunately, Jenis Ellen had been contacted with an asbest.
She worked in the network nine years, from 1978 to 1987, with two objects of clothing, one of whom was the main store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working in M&S.
Now she has two children more than 20 years old.
"For how it happened," she says, "I never heard about the mezotelium, I knew food about asbest.
I couldn't have come to see that it's gonna take me.
Some people really know much about asbest.
In fact, asbest is not one news, but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a volonic structure that reports them of clarity and delicateness.
From these six, three often used in building.
Crisotile, a widely white asbest, is most often met with others in comments today.
He was spent in blood panels, inflammation pills, the termoisilation of trumpets, cotton swimming, even in the hot car bags.
It is less important than other forms of asbest, but it is recognized by the Rose and the World Health Organization " a serious source of health threats" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, the root asbest (amosite) and the cold asbest (crokidolite).
The United Kingdom was ever the most important importer of the world's raw asbest, and experts assume that "which works, despite the indigenousness of thinking that this is a major cause of a high number of diseases with mezotel [UK]."

Jenny Elen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mezotelium, but Julian Pito's work allows her story to imagine that her story is not far off.
He conducted an investigation of sickness that allows the "percentage of mezotels, when there is no effect on → or home, were, mostly, caused by the effect of an asbest from the environment."
Most of these effects, he says, "normal use and weather effect" for our opinions.
Nobody can't be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, in which the Westminster court considered, demonstrates how people, even in the Government's centre, could have been undertaken uncertainly.
In 2009 Goddard reported that the technical shadows and tubes of the parliamentary committees were infected by an asbest whose volcano could be moved to something like "the air flows".
The members of the Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it is true that it is contrary.
Although the Directive on the Technical Service of the Parliament insisted that the Westminster court had received " pure sanitary testimony", she now recognized that it needed £1 billion of work on the Parliament's floor, enhanced electricity and removed asbest, and that members of the Parliament may have been sitting near the QE2 Conference, not at the Green Rooms of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the situation with the asbest was not governed by different rules".
You can't find out whether this manage error would have lived.
Everything you can do now is waiting.
One of those who couldn't find their contact with the asbest is Grem Abo, a general doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbo, 50 years old, he understood that he had been exercising an asbest when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in the hospital, which has been successfully pronounced by the asbesto," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the date.
It clearly remembers that this is the day at the beginning of December 2009 when he struck something like a grip.
He had 45, and he was in the middle of the operation in the dark night.
Soon I started to be disappointed.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I'm saying I can't go home all the way.
As a doctor, Abbo knew that pain and pain from the throat, the clouds around the rubbers.
However, like Janis Ellen, he had just no reason to doubt the mezotel.
Finally, he couldn't walk for a month.
The responsible doctors made rentgenous photos of the breast cell and placed the powder of the category in order to extinguish the tissue and send it to the analysis.
Yet, it remained without diagnosis.
It was gradually improved with health and returned to the same.
But from time to time the same symptoms were returned, often after he had been working and waste.
In 2011, one of the patients of Abbott came to him in a similar symptom, and he was later diagnosed with "mezotelium".
However, even then, Abbo did not relate it to his own case.
Finally, his patient was decades older and worked with asbesto.
The relationship in this case was evident.
In September 2011, with Abbott, it was deceived again, and the doctor who consulted him showed the results of the CCT and the Rentgen photographs of the specialist group.
In December 2011, at the same time two years after Abbo began to feel bad, the sensor, an equiped camera, was introduced into a half between the wheel of his breast cell and its easily cloud.
I'm optimist.
I'm usually just going further," he says.
I didn't care about that, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy came on the week between Christmas and the New Year, "I told me that it was mezotelium."
Gram Abbo: diagnosed mezotelium
Soon Abo’s meeting with Macmillan’s sisters, one of whom offered him to communicate with a lawyer.
That's exactly then, he realized the size of the epidemic.
"The asbest was broadly exposed, especially in large public opinions, where there was a very often an asbest termization on the trumpets," he said.
People who have undertaken the effect of an asbest in these opinions are now sick of this disease.
Thus, the mezotelium is now threatening younger people with non-typical professions.
The most dangerous throat asbests in hospitals were located in the pools, so it is unlikely to lose patients.
But many of those who were about to fall from one version to another (like Andrew Lawson) or eat in double tables (as Grem Abo) were almost actually affected by the effect of that art.
During several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where theoretically they saved life for patients, but the place that represented a threat to life for doctors who were treated.
He's still removed today.
Schools set their bottles on assessed bases
And it's not just a hospital.
Asbest was often found in offices, magazines, libraries and media because of its wonderful isolation and fireful characteristics.
Schools too.
In particular, many, in the first place, were subjected to the exercise of the asbest in the class.
Over the whole country, in a number of lessons of chemicals, Schools set their bottles on assessed bases.
The web sites were reporting the problem of asbest in schools.
At the same time, in our homes, such an improper thing like a flat or a cover of saraeans, as usually, contained asbest.
"This is the industrial ice based on the large number of our buildings," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Louson in the case of the Gay hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the deterioration of the garden sarae in the 1970s.
So be worthwhile, the gardens of the garden.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is that the disease is unhealthable, an enormous.
"In order to understand this, it's going to pass a lot of time," says Grem Abbo.
I returned to my own and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I tried to surgery two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to go and talk to me.
Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's situation to the patient's situation.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how it had been interrupted with the amount of information that had to be accepted.
"It was difficult to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember how I thought, "What, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
Here's everything."
Mezotelium is particularly dangerous, because the mechanism of our supporting life is only a act of breathe -- is a cause of cancer that kills.
Most cases of mezotelium are contacted with asbesto.
Asbest consists of the cross-flakes.
When the asbest is disrupted and the wolves are breathed, they can be cut into the flash, the clouds of the winds.
Woodless asbests disturb the plumb and can cause cell mutation.
"The problem occurs because of the breathing of the playing bottles of the asbest," Professor Tom Trader, a cardiac chirurg, which came to the Gay hospital in 2001.
It's the hospital where, as Andrew Lowson understood, he has been exercising an asbest, now, by the ironing of the court that leads to the treatment centre of the mezotelium.
Tragedor knew Louson and healed some other who probably had the effect in the hospital.
When the winds fall in the weights of the asbest, Trajecker says, "which is the breathing, it's throwing them out to the area where the cloud is.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the beginning.
The normal treatment of other forms of cancer is much less effective in mezotelium.
The efficiency of the intervention of the surgery, for example, causes bitter disputes.
Some have to try that.
Traider isn't able.
"It's not worth to cut the powder," he says.
It can't be able to join her knife around.
Instead, this cancer "is not very good to submit chemotherapy", which "operates", but does not cure.
"The time of time is because they will be long," says Trager.
But at the end, they all die.
Happy, some patients will have much longer than expected.
Written by Stephen Jay Guld died 20 years ago after diagnosis was placed.
Two and half years after diagnosis, Grem Abo continues to fight.
After he had been infected with mezotelium, Abbott met Andrew Lowson, who, four years ago after diagnosis, was one-likely converted into the Office of support and consultations for such diseases.
"Hey, the Cancer Central," he said lifely when they called.
"He was very local," says Abbo.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he is still very energyful.
Sna. Abbott has offered six of the chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life for a month.
"I was disappointed," he says.
I wanted to get out.
Lawson, however, "he's been able to give everything a little more locally."
By meeting several specialists, Abbo decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lanz Lazunski, professor of the Toracal Chirurgie in the Gay hospital.
"We had the advantage of that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Grem admits.
The mediterraneist should receive the direction and approval of the patient.
The money plays a decisive role for patients with mezotel to get the best types of treatment.
However, when such treatment is ineffective, the end of the end is ineffective, because many have another financial conduct for concern - the future of the families they will leave.
And then they are in the court of compensation.
Andrew Lawson joined Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse 日P.
"The asbest was for health, since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s, it was that it was understanding that even very small numbers could be risked.
It was then talking about the non-consciousness of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Gay hospital, finally, were the case, but it wasn't "resolution for full valuation", as Morgan said, because Lawson didn't be able to prove that his mezotelium was the result of contact with an asbest in the Gay hospital.
After his death investigation, the Representative of the hospital Gay confirmed, however, that " the security in the dual places that had been discussed was removed in the 1990s."
It was too slow for Andrew Louson.
How to Remove Answer
In particular, associating death contact with an asbest to one company or work - usually in decades of years after that - has been a major problem for diseases with a mezotel that require compensation.
Many of them would have changed the owner or closed.
The fearful archives could be lost.
And those who are protected from demands know that there is no time on their side of the islanders.
In response to this year, serious new laws have been issued, which facilitate the mezoteal process of recovery, even if it would not be able to investigate them.
In this law, £350 million funds were established for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but who were not to judge.
In such cases, 80 per cent of the amount that the court could be sentenced in the normal case of compensation is about 120 000 £.
Approximately 300 successful resources for this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with mezotel diseases, believes that £350 million are very good for the insurance industry.
"This is a transaction written by the insurer's insurance officers," he suggests that the sum consists of the fourth of what the insurers should be paid if they weren't interrupted with a temporary interval and because they would have been able to investigate the company and to provide a regular way.
Even Mike Penning, the former minister of work and pensions, admitted that the law was "incomplete".
However, Penning and Morgan recognize that when seven people die every day, the rapid need was necessary.
"The people suffer so much, and they need help today," Penning said during the second reading of Bill on the mezotelium in December of the past year.
Grem Abo was in the hands of Professor Loka Lanz Lazunski for 19 months.
Following the first consultations of Langz-Lazunski, the chirurg has recommended to include the responsibility that, contrary to Tom Trajezer, he considers effective.
This resulted in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a triterapie in which Lung-Lazunski can have 40 per cent of the diseases in five years.
Abo’s feeling the strength.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbo.
You see this with patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you get up, it can be very quickly disappointed.
Grem AboProperty for Oper in March 2012.
At the end of August, he ended the last of six of the chemotherapy.
The following scanners have not shown the path of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few five [cancs] in my breast cell.
I was supposed to have 50 times.
It's not a threat of life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbo's passed through six of the chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of bullet.
However, this process was physically and emotionally difficult.
You may think of practical things - about the things when I die, for example, or what a woman must show how the timer works on a battler.
When you get bad news, you become unrejoiced.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for your parents," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When the first time I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I wouldn't live for age.
They're a very different response.
Themsin is very common and energyful.
She's rass -- all her friends, and we've been calling many very quickly.
Ellie was more stuck.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something to do with all the painful cancer.
However, such discussions are not equipped with hope, even with a difficult opportunity to survive for patients with mezotel.
This disease has a dark definition (also, finally, for Steven Jay Guld).
As Andrew Morgan says, "mezotelium does not represent the threat of life.
The bodies of the Pharaoh's members are injured in the asbesto.
Flash asbests are used to strengthen the cartridge and increase the temperature.
The Elder’s plan described asbest.
It's now out of the floor that doesn't breathe.
I've seen the rocks made of him, and they're on the bankets.
The modern commercial use of asbest is beginning in Italy, where it is used for the manufacture of papers (a.k. banknote) and tissues.
Great asbest shakes are opened in Canada and Southern Republic and then in America, Italy and Russia.
This is an ideal temperature for parking engines and industrial revolution tourbine.
The world production of asbest is more than 30,000 tonnes per year.
The Statistics from Prudential show the temporary ability of those who work with asbest and whose consequences have been rejected in life.
Nelly Carshow dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testifies that the parts of the asbest in her "revealed out of doubts, the main cause of death."
It's the first case of this type.
Carshow, Turner Bros Asbestos, does not recognize responsibility.
Compensation is not paid.
During the Second World War, there is an intense development of judgment, one of the more deadly dangerous professionals in the view of contact with the asbesto.
Voluntary industrial prohibition for the import of deep asbest
The Appeal Court confirms the first successful request for health resulted in contact with asbesto in the United Kingdom.
The world production of asbest increases more than 4213000 tonnes per year.
British imports 139 000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires the licence of all asbesto workers.
The import and use of a golf and raw asbest is prohibited by the Law in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbest is prohibited in Greece.
The Act on Mesothelioom is adopted in Greece.
The compensation scheme was declared in £350 million.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but the white asbest is still used in many parts of the world.
The world production holds approximately 2 million tonnes per year.
China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to choose the rue of the protestants; the prosecutors shall be pronounced
The Chinese Parliament decided not to allow the Hong Kong electors to move candidates to the elections of 2017, despite the democratic reform requirements.
Such road, mostly, begins with long promised protests in the Hong Kong Area, since the activists started planning and isis in the hours considered after this statement.
The decision of the University of the National Representatives of the University, in fact, allows the Communist leaders to remove all candidates that are not loyal to Peking.
"This hasn't missed our expectations, but it still brings anger," said Emily Law, President of the Democracy party.
It's not what Pekin promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we have a matter of authorization.
By protecting China, Le Fey, the Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the University of People's Representatives, said that to allow the international exhibition of the choice of the Hong Kong would be too "haotic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom has delivered control over Hong Kong back to China, Pekin promised to allow the people of the region to choose by voting by the Government Chapter from 2017.
The Chinese rulers have decided on Sunday as a democratic step forward, since it gives the  Hongkongs the right to direct vote; but it also makes clear that the Chinese runners continue to keep the process in their hands by means of the candidates' committee, which is strictly controlled from Peking.
And, in a new article, only the candidates who love the country and love the Hong Kong will be allowed.
The decision was taken after a year when some of the most largests had occurred and received a large statement of protests in Hong Kong for many years.
For most of the prodemocratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisations have threatened to overcome the financial area of Hong Kong if Pekin does not guarantee this general electoral right.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central parties gathered under the rain before the Hong Kong quarter government.
At the demonstration, the organizations claimed that their movement was moved to a new stage of civil disobeyment and that they would rise on the balls of protest in the next week.
However, they did not report details, obviously, attempting to avoid problems with public authorities.
The entities reported online that the movement was "formed to take the central area only as an exceptional measure, which could be taken only if all the options of dialogue were dismissed and no other choice.
We deeply note that all the opportunities for the dialogue to be dismissed and the detention of the central area will be uncertainly made today.
The State bodies in Hong Kong were prepared for the statement of Peking for several days, and on Sunday, the Government was strengthened by security measures with police and barricad.
Based on the devils, many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing their own town control.
The inhabitants with a maternity strengthen the competition in the field of goods and services.
Furthermore, fearing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of words, begin to be under the increased pressure from Peking.
The Occupy Central movement criticises, saying that his demonstrations are risking business, the source of life force of Hong Kong.
"The consequence of which they say can lead to a large economic damage depending on how much people will participate and how long," said the Law of Regina Ip, which has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We don't want to spread anxiety about Hong Kong's out of control.
This is a presentation that is for investment.
The Chinese State SMEs also reported in the last days in which the Hong Kong activists of the movement had been shown by the Diversity of Western States.
In this year, the Agency ' s neo ' s reference to electoral rights, which reached 780000 participants, more than one five of Hong Kong electors.
In July, tens of thousands came to one of the major democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The American emissions culture comes to the university: the primary persons have proposed to come on a personal aircraft
We are pleased to respond to such a question by launching the first in Britain a "lux" category travel service for current students.
In order to make a clear impression from the arrival to the university, the company also will have such transport options as a personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their things throughout the country to a dangerous car.
In accordance with our new options for VIF, we are uncomfortablely waiting for helping students this year to reach the university with a minimum effort and to have a role.
The representative of the company reported that, since this service was just running, the orders have not yet been made, he added that "the students will begin to offer this service for a few weeks."
The company also stated that despite the need for the students to have 9000 £ per year, she hoped to find the market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make good first impression, and VIF is exactly what it needs.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students discriminated this service as rejected from reality.
Megan Dan, Vice-President of the High Education, said, "This project is incrediblely rejected from the life of most students.
Many students who start to learn at the university in this month are undertaken with a crisis of life worth when the financial support available in the form of credits and grants does not succeed with the efficient costs of basic needs, before they can start thinking about to exhaust thousands of pounds for something simple in society.
Feminists raised the issue of racial accession and conduct of police after Ferguson
The inappropriate growth was killed by the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, before this month.
The coming arose the hands, scandering, "Do not shoot up" until they wait in front of the graves.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, who had murdered a safe growth of Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoil Press noted that the Internet talk was moved among white feminists.
According to her experience, the white feminists, who remained in comments, set a gender above racial accession when there was a question of transparency of reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as the pressure on the Middle Western has grown and a national attention, Press has seen the responses of white women who were 100 per cent in racial adherence.
In comparison with the reaction of black women after the death of August 9, the different ease with the titles such as "the thoughts of Ferguson from → white woman" and "Feminism" were not only about women's disturbance.
But they demonstrated a move for Press.
"In pheminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about the white skin flower and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People feel needed to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic for the crisis with which we have joined, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so connected to raciality, they feel that it is necessary to indicate.
For the English Professor at the University of Ohio Cority Mitchell Ferjuson, the issues of black Americans are issued every day but are not considered as "femish problems" in the cultural field.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and I'll get 150 lifts all over here," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are attacked in their own country, silence is tough.
"Why are women safe to speak about publicly, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the United States history, there is no divergence between the issues of racial accession and the gender.
From her view, the black women are in that position to clearly divide these problems; they are complicated with complex reality every day.
While white women are now discussing the issues of raciality and gender in the feminist management, Angela Hatter, professor of women and gender investigations at the University of George Mason, says that their preachers did against them.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10000 black men were declined, and it almost always served the violation of a white woman," race Hatter.
There was a white woman who confirmed the story to base the linching.
From Hatter ' s view, the disruption between white and black women, such as Susan B. Anthony, had studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and saw that the fight for electoral rights would only be effective for one of the groups: women or black.
"They decided to put all eggs into the right of vote for women, and the right of vote for black bodies should have appeared later," Rass.
The view of such things gives us a clear view of why color women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after the women received vote right in 1920, the white women were delayed for the prevention of white women in Association for the prevention of lingering.
The group appeared nearly 40 years after the first request of the black women, said Mitchell.
From Mitchell's view, the reaction of white feminists to the problems raised in Ferguson is the behaviour of police, racial discrimination, which reflects the time when white feminists have been "doing" the problems of the women's blackness in several generations.
"Well, it would be great if the activists who have such [traditional feministic] ideology had the right to educate a child as they relate to the right to contraception?", asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second wheel, which have made careers for the fight against reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, now begin to understand what this means.
The known white activist of Gloria Stainham's feminist movement was repeated with Facebook and repeated the series of articles of the Guardian Republic of Carroll, which needed white Americans to participate in racism protests.
"I hope women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the points of view of racial problems that are fully different in public issues - will be mainly changed," wrote Stein.
Although Stainimus is deemed to be more crossing pheminism, which includes the problems of raciality, and the gender, its comments on race in America have been made to some of them.
Studies of the American Institute of Christine Somers, the author "Who stole feminism?", said She The People that young men in the United States, especially the colored young people, "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the comments on Ferguson are contrary to the criticism she said before.
Now we have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but just nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiates a small program, "My brother," to help the vulnerable black and spanishly speaking, he followed anger from many feminists, including Gloria Stain.
Police related to black community is not the only problem that continues the traditional feminist line.
After the United States border service arrested approximately 63,000 non-completely without co-operating to the southern-west border of the country this year, the immigration re-employed again - this time as a woman's problem.
Andréa Mercado, president of We Belong Together, a organization that supports women in the immigration reform, said that in order to put this problem as important for women, she had only to share in women's immigrant history.
"They're talking about themselves," said Mercado.
When the majority of the slaves are issued [immigrants], women who come with them are in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories have a response to women's organizations," she said.
Ipsvic house is selling "with swine"
The photograph of the house made for sale in Saffolke was removed by agents inmobility when it appeared that there was a big swimming swimming in the hotel.
The sale of £120000, a home with one room stands on the private road to Ipsvic.
The detailed description was different from the graphics of the house of the house, on which the swine was drawn up with the rubber.
The Country Inmobility Agency reported that the swine on the graph is a householder's owner's owner.
"The same time, the graph was placed for a mistake and has already been removed," reported the representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Con日s described the former house of the meetings as a "Unical House with one room".
Although the Agency has removed the graph from its website, it is still maintained in reklame materials.
The sale of the house was interested in the networks where some asked whether the swine was sold together with the house.
The Russian tennisist Maria Sharapova, in the fourth quarter of the US Open Caroline Voznacky, believes she is not enough for stability.
According to the sportsman, she wants to end the year worthly and try to go out to a new level, which is transferred from New York Basiley OSIPOV.
How do you generally make your results on the "Small Sleam" tours this year?
Of course, I'm glad you could win Rolan Harros.
What's going on with three other tours, I didn't have enough stability, especially in the ends of some mads.
Now, of course, I'm disappointed.
Because she couldn't even come to the fourth final.
What tasks do you put before the end of the season?
After a hurt, I have a great motivation to get out to a new level.
I have what to work on, and I'm going to do everything possible to end the year worthly.
The Asian tourner series begins a few weeks ago.
The member of the Committee on Fisheries, Culture, and Joven Affairs, the former Champion of the peace of Nicolai Valuev, proposed to comply with the WTO standards for granting bonuses when they arrived.
According to his statement, the standards will be the same as at the Council, that people will provide standards for encouraging, running and other exercises.
At the same time, the Russian 12 members will begin to introduce from 1 September the GTO standards on their territory.
I also made the students who gave the GTO to give bonuses when they entered the bowl, said Baluev.
For example, they can add a little balls to the EAG.
There are also proposals to give additional outcome to enterprises that have passed the data.
There was a new millioner in Harvey in South Wales after winning a lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
There is a search for a new millioner on the south-west of Perth, where one happiness for nearly 1,1 million dollars with a lottery breakfast on Saturday evening.
The Gazet Cook in Harvey offers gold in the second time in five years, the last winning of $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner needs to be declared about himself.
The owner of the Law Steve Forward said that the winning was called an agiotage in a small town to the southwest of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and it's all awesome.
We thought that such a winning could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia have granted the main prize last month, noting the end of several successful weeks for the players of the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Way is one of the five billion August, after a big $7,5 million winning from Belmont, just a few weeks before it.
The winning couple has played for twenty years and told them that the winning has given them the opportunity to travel throughout the world and to buy a new home.

Mineconstruction wants to increase the electricity market
In this week, the Mineconomen Development will introduce the Government a comprehensive environmentally clean transport plan in Russia, reporting the Department of the Ministry of Oleg Pludžers on the round of the board, which was carried out "Awareness" at the Moscow Car Salon - 2014.
The plan was established by the Government, one of the main goals, is the reduction of the gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September, on the beginning of October, as stated by Plugins, the proposed measures are cossed by electricity and hybrids - the plan for the development of vehicles on gaseous fuel in Russia already exist.
The plan (copy is "Applause") was calculated for 2014-2017.
Electro- and hybrid transport criteria should be described and decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally clean vehicles.
The report to the Government, in which tax and taxable support measures will be described, will be prepared for December 2014; the liability scheme of credit and liability will be held until April 2015; and proposals for reducing the price of cars, stimulating the location and establishing service infrastructure will be extended to October 2015.
In 2014-2015, amendments to normative legislation should be made to facilitate the conditions for the building of ship infrastructure (for parking, auto-conduct and forward).
Moreover, the Federal Authorities have formulated proposals for regional authorities in 2015 to stimulate the use of the environmentally clean transport - in the form of the benefits of the movement and parking, for example; and for February 2016, and for the extension of the carrying out of such transport.
Finally, the Mineconomen Development will introduce a number of indicators of the activities of the regional authorities of the criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the production of environmentally clean transport, the development of low infrastructure.
The Electro-Russian bank was sold by approximately 100 electricity in 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, the renewable import mail on electricity, so the sales are about 500 hours, the main Executive Director Mitsubishi Motors in Russia André Pankov.
However, the five-fold growth does not make the electricity a few notes: in 2013, in Russia, according to the Association of Peace Business, 2,78 million of easily and competitive commercial cars were sold.
Until Russia’s electricity only imports Mitsubishi Motors.
Initial imports are prepared by Renault - the company is primarily oriented to corporate customers, says Renault's planning and partnerships in Russia Nicola Remis.
However, most other electrical transport producers have taken a surprising position in relation to Russia.
Once the electricity is available, the Russian producers also have ", GAZ, "," but the emission of the mixture.
For example, in January - July 2014, "Asm-holdinga", "AutoWAZ" issued 30 electronics.
A question of a little because of a traveling electricity, admits the "AutoWAZ" Director on the Sergei Amanov Engineering, without the support of the broadcast in this segment....
The development of the Russian electricity market other than the traveling machines (the electricity sold in Russia, the average double rate of analogs with internal burning engines) contains the inequality of low-infrastructure (increasingly units), increasing the "Autostate" Manager of Sergei Celikov.
Because of traveling and low levels of self-degradation of electricity in nearly 3-4 years, the Russian market's lower segment is proclaimed by the Main Editor of the Author's Michael Travelhowanski, Celikov is agreed with it.
Instead, producers say that some electronic models are already close to the valuation of normals.
The Russian market has good perifers, mainly to universal the consumer's confidence that "electro-electricity" is real; this will, in particular, contribute to the presentation of all new charges, underlines the President of the BMW group in Russia Walfgang Slimma.
Such infrastructure projects, for example, are developed by the "Russettes" ladies: There are several in Moscow buildings, there are about 80.
The negotiations on the building of a network are also conducted with other regions.
According to the Director of the Department of Russia, Vladimir Sophia, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build amendments throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electricity in the country and a lack of a single standard for the load of electricity of different brands.
Moreover, as a network company does not have the right to sold electricity, "Rossettes" is working to do this for the load of electricity.
Pankov considers the most effective support for the forming of the electricity market in Russia.
The Null Tax will be made until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extending, expanding the low-break.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environmental (the idea is discussed and covered by all cars) will also support the market, but it is not as sensitive as well as the preferences of the Pinkkov.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, for example, from Norway, where the reduction of the loan has resulted in the increase in electricity sales - there are now 12 per cent of the market.
Russia needs and stimulating measures for auto-governeurs, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as they have already done in Moscow), certain Pankov, or the possibility of electrical transmission, which is not yet in Russia.

General Praut (right) appointed the Minister for the Defence of the Right of Wongsuvan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister Tailanda, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of a new Office of Ministers of the country in which more than thirds are debt by generals or generals.
The representatives of the military have received key posts: Ministers of Defence, Financial, Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministers.
On Monday, Praat Chan-Ocha was officially at the Premier Minister after the official approval of King Tayald the appointed head of the temporary military Government for this post.
The 60-year-old military enforcement in the country was the only candidate to the Premier Post.
He was selected by the Prime Minister at the Parliament's meeting.
The previous military appointed deputates of the parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Ocha, the conversion was the only way to maintain stability.
He had previously continued a half-year demonstration in which protesters needed the Government's Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat.
Officially, the work of Chan-Ocha will be a temporary premier, since military planning to make general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there is anxiety that military people are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
Armies arrived to the authority of May 22
on the background of the full paralyzing civil authorities.
The leaders of the main political party were undertaken by temporary arrest.
Once they arrived to the authorities, they undertaken a temporary arrest of the country's leading policies, including the Prime Minister of Yingluk Chinavat.
Some journalists and public operators were also arrested.
The current political crisis is running from the roots in 2006 when the military was a Prime Minister of Brother Yinglek Chinavat Taxi.
They both use the population among the rural population, especially in the northern areas of the country, which often had success in choices.
However, many representatives of the average class and staff elite have entered an anti-governmental movement which has practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said it would be better in the Media Hall, I didn't promise you, a officer from the new Palm brossure.
It must be formally admitted that it is really so, but the ice and the iron remain inappropriate.
For a long time, we're saying "Belgia" -- we're under the media, we're talking "midians" -- we're in Belgium.
Restaurants love to deeply declare that the success of the conduct depends on three factors: this is location, location and again location.
There's places that are broken not to be good, but even good, but something inappropriate.
Shortly, I felt behind the Palm chair, I remembered that there was sometimes a "Grodock" coffee (in honour to the most teletransmissioner), then "Odesas-ma", and also the Restaurant "Good" and the beer "Dragba".
Now it's beer, but it's no longer the Natal-Soviet, but the Belgian.
On the ground, only the issberg is placed: the bar and a couple of stones, the rest of the space is even a sunlight.
That's why it's funny, like in the comma: red, yellow and green walls, different colored stones, instead of televisions where the Russians flow.
The Belgian instructions in Petterburg haven't been in the news for a long time, so compare to something.
Eight species of dilution beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 l) and unnumbered bottle (170-1550 rubles).
The Company-Positive Officer presents a pleasant menu, explaining that "midians are soft seeds", and it should be noted that a service is, despite the most important part of Palm.
The menu is expected for content, but it is often very unexpected for the implementation.
Well, for example, it is advertised that the meat roll with a vallonic blackness (280 rubles) is actually a carpet that is so tired that the pergament paper will be shown insanely.
You can just feel some funny, just if you're throwing a half-pool together.
It's worse with salates.
The classic league (260) would be the most regularly recognizing the crime against the Belgian people: some fucking issberg, opened sometimes a long-term card, cutting a chenical fashion, covered by the chips of the becon, and for something marined.
You don't want to meet anyone!
The ingredients of the Belgian Hall were partly other, but the impression was also not a positive difference.
If there were still a closing of eyes on the invisible quarters of pomidors of shoes or injured champions, why the mediums look like they have been able to disturb and open for their lives?
'Cause I already know, there's a full standard of white-morrow media here!
They are understood in the "suses for your choice" boxes (490-560 rubbles in 0.5 kg).
Souss is a half-life, the one of the white wine, the soldier, and the merchandise was not clear.
There are sheep, and there is no aroma, whether there was a wine, and it was a mystery.
That's why good people trust freedoms with a homemayonese.
The fucking water here is not a bread that goes up to that degree that, depending on the construction, you can decide, the first or second stone in front of you, but just a pleasant sugar.
It was stated that the rubber was prepared in the bird soap, and nothing was spoken about divorce.
The situation is diameterly opposed to the situation, and the rosmarine has deceived everything.
It was impressive that this hole had been feeded exclusively with rosmarine boxes, from which the meat had so much insufficient aroma.
But it was noteworthy to the feet of the crown -- no, just a refusal in the caramellised corner.
The wallets in Palm are not only sweet but also sick - with rubber, cut or becon and sick (220-280).
The clone sow has been exhausted from water, and the waffle is sown.
But the manager to the table was very informally interested in the pressure.
So we should be coming again.
Dollar curses were raised over 37 rubbers in the news on the Western news of new sanctions against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The $10,29 msk grows on 26,9 cups and composed 37.02 rubbers, the course was up to 30 cups - to 48.73 rubbers, testifying the Moscow boards.
The bivalent crash increased on 28 pockets to the previous closing level and was 42.28 rubs.
On 19 February 2009, he had 36.43 rubs, and on 3 March 2014 he had 37.005 rubs.
On the night on August 29, the White House reported that the President Barak Obama and the German officer Ang Mercel discussed the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.
The weighing of the rubber is a long-term character, along with a park with a dollar.
The long-term prognoses suggested that this note, says an elderly analytical "Alpary" Anna Bodrova.
Everything with Ukraine will be reflected on courses.
As long as it continues, investors will respond.
Today, the hearing of the income of the military is not under any side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the facts that he was sustained to such news were remarked yesterday.
The week, according to the prognoses of the specialist, is closed about these levels -- 36.90 and 37.05 bubbles per dollar.
The tax period ended, prices for oil, policies, sanctions, gas transition problem through Ukraine -- all this is a single cup.
The inflation inflation is also predicted: to the current prices of egg, 5 to 10 per cent will be added to the current prices.
Moreover, seasonal fruits and fibres are completed, and there will be a vacuum until the networks are reoriented on other suppliers.
"Dollar reached the mark in 37 rules, passed it and returned, there is no powerful history," comments the leader of the "Opening of Broker" Constantin Bushuev market analysis.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be introduced in the Sabbath, as the NATO will be seen.
Rubble, according to his statement, was very weak after the finishing of the tax season, then sent news to Ukraine, and the CB said that it was completely going to the floating course until the end of the year and refused any monetary interventions.
If looking at the daily coverage, it was nothing different from those previously in this month, all feared exactly the mark in 37 rubles, and the analysis continues.
And so, there was nothing powerful in the area of the traffic.
Three months for the currency market were, at the end of January, noted a higher question on the currency as well as on the third March when the CB was charged with a recordable quantity of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the local side of the weight of the rubber.
First of all, this is the increase in the income part of the budget from export operations, and the increase in competitiveness of internal producers in the light of import threats, says the main UFS IC Alexy Kozlov analysis.
Importing goods and services can be brought to negative moments.
The rare Russian currencies are significantly reduced by investment in the Russian economy, providing inflation pressure and, as a result, caused by the risk of payment of money, which, in turn, distorted the country's economy.
If you talk about the market of action, the estimation of the rubber is a number of reduction of the prices of the share expressed in the rubbers.
For example, the MVB index in the quarter market was decreased by 1.67% and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
The long-term difference in the reduction of the index is explained by the weakness of the rubber for more than 1,5 per cent per day.
The weight of the rubber is emotional and is explained by the mass effort to buy a currency.
As shown by a race, emotions are gradually not ahead, and the rubber boxes are partly or completely resuming lost positions.
"We believe that we can see the proportion of dollars and Russian currency near the level of 36 rubbles per dollar," notes Alexander Kozlov.
Genetal disturbance is often wrongly diagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years, thinking she would die after the diagnosis was wrong.
Carin Rogers had been a major part of her adult age, thinking she was still alive just a few years after she had diagnosed another disease.
In fact, she had the disease of Sharko-Mary-Tut (SHMT) - a group of heritage injuries that lead to the injury of nerves outside the brain and the dinner.
The CMT UK favorable reported that the wrong diagnosis is a part of the problems between the people with the SMT, because it is so little about this status.
Approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom, probably, have a SMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle quality, uncertain origin and feet fingers.
Because they may feel disturbance or pain, and it does not be treated and progressed, which means that the symptoms are strengthened with time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the attitude of Fridrey (AF) - with the predictation for which it was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be bound to an invalid cross until she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two kids now 51 said, "I knew the child that I couldn't do anything else.
I fell every day, and I had more time for everything.
I was never able to attack the rolls or the squatboards with other children, and I had a lot of people in school because I was running and running.
Rogers said that when she had 13, after several operations, to free the axle likeness and to cut up a hundred, she hit her medical card when her doctor came out of the comma, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I was cut off the nose where it was, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I returned home, found information about this status in the library and wrote in the Associ AF," she said.
When I received the answer, I was able to get the most terrible panic than it was.
I thought I'd be in the invalid chair at 18 and die before I was 25, and I'd gradually lose all my abilities in this area.
I went through it alone, and I'm planning my own funeral.
She said that at the time she had 17 years, she realized that her ability to walk was not so harmful as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just rose up, covered me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, because you'd have been in an invalid steel."
I think you have something that represents a very less threat to life.
After several genetic investigations, she found the SMT.
"When he explained what it was, I thought it was a happy ticket," she said.
The Great Britain's favorable SMT has announced a month of information about the SMT to try to take into account this disease.
The tax burden on Vasington's area undertakers shall be in terms of reconstitution of the economy
The rebuilding economy means more clients, more sales and new workshops.
This also means higher taxes.
The payment of State taxes and at a level for companies throughout the country has increased moderately in the past year when the renewal of the economy was achieved, according to the new investigation held last week, and the company in Washington area is not exceptional.
Companys in the area, Maryland and Virginia paid a total of $27.6 billion in the state's penalty and at financial level in 2013, with 3.8 per cent more than $26.6 billion collected for 2012.
The tax rate for state and employment in the past year was increased by 4.3 per cent, up to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year ago, and it was the third level of growth after the next year when the account was reduced in 2009 and 2010.
The taxes taken by the State increased faster, 4.3 per cent than the taxes, 3.9 per cent, under the investigation carried out by the company of the service professional, Ernst & Young and the State tax charge centre, the tax policy group.
More than half of the tax income in the area, 56 per cent are charged by undertakers, while 36 per cent of the tax income of Maryland is in the company.
The Virginia, with 28 per cent, brings the lowest amount of tax income, proportionally from undertakers.
Increasing the increase in tax income results in the continuing level of insufficiency of companies, researchers say that taxes have increased by 3.7 per cent in this year after three years when the growth has increased less than 1 per cent.
While the large part of these income is in large states such as California, New York and Texas, the same is going to happen in Washington.
Company in the area, Maryland and Virginia totally paid 10 billion dollars for State independence and employment in the past year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, compared to the previous year.
However, the return of the value of insecurity does not have any similar effect on the growth of taxes in the state and at the level of Mariland, where food insurance taxes exceed one fifth tax accounts of companies.
Virginia and the Columbia Company pay about half of State tax accounts and at the level of insurance taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that the majority of their inevitability, especially the tax base around the Columbia Country, belongs to the Government or non-Communities, which do not pay taxes for insurance," said Duglas Lindholm, the Executive Director of the State Insurance Centre.
Thus, Maryland must have much more confidence, for example, to pay the same services in other states.
Recent growth of tax income from enterprises is to explain the renewable market of insufficiency.
The income of enterprises also appear to be adjusted by this data.
Companys in the region declared a corporate tax at State level of $2,3 billion, more than $2,1 billion than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income income, mostly in the region.
Though trends are addressed in one direction, the tax price of the enterprises at the level is not increased by the same speed in all three levels.
The growth level in Columbia was at the same level as the average country, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only in Virginia, tax income was observed below the average amount of 4,1 per cent.
In Virginia was the lowest corporate tax of three legal rights (in each of which the same corporate rates) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate tax is 8.25 per cent, while in the surrounding area it is 9.975 per cent.
It seemed to be studied by the United States Trade Palace before this year that in Virginia the lower taxes for State-level undertakers and, in general, the climate is more favorable to the taxes for undertakers than in Maryland.
The surroundings have not been evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia has experienced competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a legal act that reduces the corporate tax in this year from 6,9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the tax will fall to 5 per cent per year.
If the State continues to achieve tax income objectives in the year of the year, this law would be eligible for the employees even to 3 per cent by 2017.
At the time, the small business in the Washington area seems to feel better and thus pays more taxes for the state and at the level of a recent investigation.
The taxes for enterprises payed in the form of a individual suitable tax by small business owners are a transitional structure in which the majority of small enterprises were built in Columbia, Maryland and Virginia were increased by 20 per cent in the past year to $2,4 billion, with a greater speed of growth than taxes for enterprises in the total.
Researchers say that the trend and increase of income from business taxes throughout the country, mostly, will be maintained in this year, in the case of taxes in the governments and at the level of employment increased by 6,2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014, compared to the same period of the past year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area can be lost, since the reduction of the federal costs is based on the labour market in the region.
Brunish Age of Russian →Juda
The householder of the world's campaign on Jude has brought to Russia two silver and seven brain wages.
As a result, the Russians were only the main Favorite of Japan ' s collection.

Joan Riverz's family hopes for the best
Joan Riverz is unconscious of the arrival to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedic actor will be corrected from the disease.
"Thank you for your continuous love and support," Melissa Riverz said in the statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother came to Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an extraordinary call about her retention of her heart at the highest Side Clinic, Yorkville Endoscope, reported the sources.
The doctors keep it under drugs and closely monitored until they are satisfied with the " hard" remains.
The answer was large, including a number of support on the Internet from such as Donald Tromp, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Everything's fine kings.
In the sale of a debit album of the Royal Blood group, the new British Year's hope was made out of rockduetes from the stadium clubs.
Duet Royal Blood is already active on the scene, but has already a name for the BBC premium, the Arctic Monkeys breakfast tour and visits the New York Concert of Jimmy Paige.
Their unnamed album has received 100 thousand orders in a few months before the reception, and the contract for its release is located in the portfolio of Mejor-Leebla Warner Music.
In view of the current crying situation on the market, the situation from a number of outside is out, because the new Lane Dell Ray or the fairly sweet representative of the new R'n'B, but the duetes of britains playing with the level of volume and intensity that was last in the mode a few decades ago.
In general, the taxes for the first album in relation to all the above-signed circumstances were particularly high and have already been completely justified.
Duatt had never seen the name that could be achieved before that the hair metalists were totally discouraged, and the blood of the Queenes runs like them, they have in their lives, is also understandable.
Of course, primarily about the heroes of the past Led Zeppelin: as well as a big quarter, Royal Blood is putting his goal to endanger the blood of the British Year by bringing it to a new height.
To do proof about the success of this undertaking until, please, it is vulnerable, but something is already possible.
A decade of songs that are set up in 30 minutes is not a demonstration of the phenomenonal supplier as a confidence and powerful declaration of the presentation.
See the valuation of some numbers, it is, to refuse, to say, the "Out of the Black" pilot singe is characterized by the one who is remembered not by the line's meal, but by the barban party.
The musicians say that this song is easier to shoot than to sing.
It is also worth selecting the powerful "Little Monster" and closing the "Better Strangers" composition with a shexpire quota in the heading.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound greatly at the district of lovers of a heavy year, but when playing a group, they will be thrown into more or less unidirectly.
And that's not absolutely bad, even in turn.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they are not claiming on the labs of the new Lennon and Cartneys (the more sealed in the Mo日head recipients), but have produced numerous rockduetes from the ghetto indi clubs.
They have, despite some differences, created for stadiums, in the house, less than a few thousand people, apparently intensely.
The secret of partial use of the base that replaced the hytrar in a normal form, adjudicated at the beginning of the Zero The White Stripes.
Nevertheless, the matter is not only in tools but also in the way to make a song.
The Null Retrovery Heroes were chosen for a number of postmodernist paradigms, with a huge neo, to recognize themselves not only by epigons, but by autonomous creative units.
Royal Blood now sounds so strong and hard that this effort is successfully dragging a few secondary and firm materials.
Well, finally, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twi for $1,04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what he reported on Friday morning: Online and video manufacturer, and another hundred other things, buying a Twi's TV playing service for $1,04 billion.
This news of surprise is not because no one expected that Twi would be sold, but because many expected youTube to be buyer.
Three months ago the sale of the Google videoservice for a good billion looks completely ready, and this compilation looked natural.
Twi, which was three years ago like Justin.tv, for the purpose of being a current general service -- YouTube version in real time.
Instead, he was quickly converted into a form where the gayers translated their internal moments; "YouTube for the game in real time", according to Business Insider.
Interface Twi.
And "let's play", a genre of video-rollers in which everyone gives (in particular, old) games, such as the "Theatre of the Natives", is already on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when it describes Twi, so the news that YouTube receives Twi -- has been met without interest, a classic example of a technological enhanced company that purchases a potential competitor.
This is a secret why the YouTube negotiation was lost, taking into account that, according to the information, he was ready to make less than Amazon.
All we have at this time is a statement from the Executive Director Twi -- Emmett Shira: "We chose Amazona, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them quickly."
Another secret, honestly, is an incredible success of Twi.
Snobs like me, who claim that they will be better to do than to look at him, are difficult to understand the ability to look at games instead of taking a joystick in their hands.
One thing is to look through the boat of a friend at the 3th morning when it's running through the Resident Evil, and it's fully different - to see how a foreign man gets 20 shoots in the Call of Duty.
All the games you could look right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are counted on one person, so looking at their seed without self-controlling the angle of the view may be a recept of the pain worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed transitions in which Rogers Bennisters of our Electronic Age ended the total games in record periods.
But if it isn't about the virtual game or humor, it is little likely that its Twi channel will be interested.
But what do skeptics know like me?
Twi has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is a fourth source of pick-in-net-traffic.
What exactly does Amazon say about this?
It's hard to say that Twi's going to be in Amazon Instant Video as well as YouTube could simply shoot Twi.
However, Twi has something that would be pleased to receive any company: too, young men whose reclaimers are talking about.
As chapter Twi's Shir, Amazon and Twi said, "both believe in the future game," and this channel doesn't give a sign of conviction, even ooh, as a visionary view.
As a result, more than 330 people died in 2004, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were hurt.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
The survivors - almost all of the students, with the parents of the dead - the town of Angels - Ramon Caspolat, the head of the Committee of the Susan Dudiae, who participated in the speech operation of the MSC, reports the Correspondent of Elizabeth Anton, who worked on the speech project.
When they returned to Moscow, they met Aslambea, who was 10 years ago the President of North Kawkaz, and negotiated with terrorists, as well as the Officer of the FSB of the Russian Veceславe of Bocharov.
What I was particularly able to do during the work of this subject is that in Beslan there was no one in these ten years.
This subject is extremely sick for all who have some attitude to it, people are hardly agreed to talk about what happened.
Impressions from the wheel are very hard.
But forget Beslan, and I hope we have done our task," Antonov said.
The project has been prepared by the halling of Rambler & Co, which works in a company at the weight of this year.
The previous projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15-year-old residence of Vladimir Pu.

Deputates proposed to entry into force of personal data law
In the event of the success of the initiative, the Russian data will keep on the servers from 1 January 2015
The draft legislation for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Russian personal data law already adopted from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is placed on the basis of the law of the underground palace.
Her authors expressed the deputates of the House of Vadim Dingyn, Jaroslav Nilov (LDR), the Federal Gineni (Single Russia), the Vladimir Parachin (Russian Justice) and Alexander Yujonko (KPF).
This amendment, according to the initiative authors, will contribute to more operational and effective ensurement of the rights of the RF citizens to maintain personal data and to comply with the secrets of the transmission in the telecommunication networks.
The Law, which the parliamentary acts in force, obligates to keep the Russian data processed via the Internet on the RF.
It also makes obligation to register, systematic, capture, storage, accurate and exhaustion of the personal data of the RF citizens, in the databases available in Russia, as well as the information on the distribution of such databases.
Furthermore, the Law provides the right to the Court's decision to access the information processed with violation of the RF's personal data law.
The Law also provides the establishment of such "swarm lists" sites - the automatic instruction system "Recorders of the rights of personal data subjects".
That law was adopted by the House for a year.
The authors of the law project expressed Andrew Lugo and Vadim Dingin from LDR and Alexander Yujonko from the KPRF.
Finance and Jujonko are also one of the authors of the current legislation on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who have no date in the RF must be charged
In commenting on the draft legislative draft today in the House, Leonid Levin said that he did not see the issue of transmission of the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to his statement, those companies who will not have their own personal data stores on the RF territory by 1 January 2015, are able to arrange them, for example, "Rosselkoma", who repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers in the arend and already provide their servers, in the Mail Group, in the western companies that are already delivering their servers today."
"There are also a few independent dates ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If the company decides to execute the law and continue to work on the RF territory, I don't see any problems -- they will receive technical opportunities for the location," said Levin.
Proportional legislative project
On the contrary, after the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association is threatened that in the case of adoption of the legislative project, the growth will no longer be able to carry out many global networks.
In particular, on the online broadcasting services of aircraft and hotels.
According to the association, "the legislation remains the subjects of personal data - the citizens of the Russian Federation ' s right to distribute their own data in terms of determining that their registration, systematicity, etc. should be provided only in the databases available on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement highlights that the user ' s information mechanism would be more effective for the systematic system of personal data.
In this case, it will be possible to choose the territory for which the measures are to be carried out.
The adoption of such "localisation" projects of personal data in other countries led to global services and economic losses.

Other ways to focus on university teachers

Professors, for example, Ingrid Bracey, director of the "College without a wall" at the University of Masachusetts in Emherste, will tell students about the previous issues.
Sometimes updates are not eligible for employment.
In such cases, old issues may often be found for a very small part of the value of the last issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, belonging to "eBay Inc", is a popular alternative to buy books.
Procate
To take the teachers a prosecution, you should think if you are good enough to do with them, you will not forget to return them, nor forget to leave them after the course is done.
You can scan more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the "Matematic Analysis" prosecution for about $20.
Discover the rules of the store where you are in the books, including any steps that can be expressed for marks, signatures and disorders.
If you are able to read the book, remember: If you don't return the book, the traps may even exceed the value of the new exemplary.
E-books
Electronic books instead of traditional teachers are another option.
Sometimes such books are owned by receiving electronic licence for a certain period of distributions, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Matemat of Analysis" report on the Chegg.com website for six months will run about $61.
Bracey says that students who study literature often can find the most beneficial prices, since many classic productions can now be locked freely, while literature on natural and ingenious sciences can be very delighted.
Despite anything, look at it.
Joe Gold, 29 years of age, who is going to start learning in the Jurid's Peperdin School, recommends to use the ISBN number to explain the prices of the book, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before making an order on the Internet, Gold says, check whether the book is actually on the table.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he received was four weeks, and, finally, he paid the full price in the university book store.
Putin stated the full inefficiency of the Next East Development Fund
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin reported at the meeting on the maintenance of priority investment projects and territories on the Next East that the budgetary investment of the Near East Development Fund, which was created two years ago, reported ineffectively to the Interfax.
"15 billion rubbles have remained at the depths," stressed the President.
At the meeting of the Chapter of the State, the overseer of the areas of development at the Next East was ordered.
He claimed that the draft law necessary for the establishment of TORs should be introduced to the House of this ear.
The Federal assembly, noted by the President, did not confirm the reference to the Territory of Environmental Development on the Next East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also made the main tasks for the development of the Near East.
In the midst of them, the transport of the region, the infrastructure of infrastructure, both on the internal market and for the development of exports.
Furthermore, further investments in the region should be introduced, and the President has underlined the development territory, which should be competitive on the basis of the key business centres of the ATR.
At the same time, it was reported that the OECD territory could be replaced.
Why "The Watchtowers of the Galaky" couldn't save cassual collections
"Incontainable 3" Silvester Stallone returned less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million budget in the United States, while "The town of sins: a woman for which it should be killed" only returned $12 million from its budget of $70 million.
The Home Video with Cameroon Diaz only brought $14.6 million in the first output, while the films, such as "What Does Dracon 2" are also disappointing.
The article of the Telegraph Robby Colline film shows that when talking about the movies, it may be wrong to films.
Collin called the "goodest" year in 2014 throughout the history of the films, and called "How to offer dracon 2" the "functioning" and continuing the fantasy.
However, when a number of more age films and films are recorded, it seems that the problem is not obliged to be a film.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average reviews of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each film that went up to a procate for a year at least 2000 copies between the Memory Day of May and July 20, 2013 and for this year.
Results that take account of the opinions of cinema and cinemacrits are allowed to assume that the films of this year are like a calibrary of last year.
The commentators assume that the matter can be changed in the viewing habits and the continuing population of the Internet services such as Netflix.
Reviser John Favoro, who currently works on the quick out of the design film "Jungley book", said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think the time is changed."
We have to admit that and not try to take care of what was before.
In contrast with the current cass collections in Hollywood, Netflix has reached $1,2 billion, almost twice over the last year number of $837 million.
For the past year, register Steven Spilberg discovered the study because they were too trusted in the comics fractions, and he predicted "cook" Hollywood.
In the light of the present fall, some commentators claim that there was a part of truth in its dark proofs.
As a result of the outcome of several potential cass hits in 2015, including "The Artists: Ery Altron", "Minuons" and "Your Park", the other representatives of the cinema industry are more optimistic.
The producer of the People X Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of cass collections just "equal", said Hollywood Reporter: "The next year will be the most cassual year in history, and no one will care about it."
Product sanctions are not afraid of the owners of cabacasia and Media Asian food, but for the restaurants of the Russian and Japanese kitchen is a dream.
In general, it is preferred to substitute the imports prohibited by products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a small sun-shirt walker than a bad mozarel," the Italian Restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio's headquality, which makes him suppliers instead of the Italian.
The Mocerel and the bullet surrounded first in the restaurant, they had a small time of storage.
The stocks of the parmesan must be enough for a few months.
What are you doing?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes the eyes clear that shocking memories do not leave him until that.
The meat was there on the boxes at 30 centimeters of the half!
There are cats!
Cryss!
Then I said we would never buy anything on Russian markets for our restaurant.
I don't know, maybe it's changed there now.
But in the days, I was brought to a fish test from the Next East.
That's what she's talking about!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is deceived that many things are usual for Italy for the Russian producer in dicowinna.
A few years ago, I had to buy a Russian bathroom.
In Italy, meat is highlighted for 10 days at the temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must be thrown up to become mild in order to make the mouse swimming.
I've done all this with the rubber.
Then they asked me, "Where did you take such an unclean meat?"
I said, that's your, Russian!
Why don't anyone do that?
In five minutes, Barlotti's walking in the French Restaurant "Brasserie Most" in the kitchen is a stop list in which there are no products: French urigines, marine ships.
The Restaurant of the Brasserie Most and Bar "Stree" Regis Trigell is not as pessimisticly designed as Valerio: the French officers have already been replaced by Tunis, and instead of French sugars will buy Swiss.
Instead, Regis becomes more emotional when the words are about Russian suppliers: "The Blue Capusus is 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why is it so worth?"
They're answering, "We've got to do it too."
But this cup shouldn't be worth 80 rubbles!
We're buying remote wheat, but they're 15-20 years old, do you imagine how weighing their powder?
The price is that it's superdelecate.
The Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources for foreign ships.
Standard story: "The first three months everything was good, then the quality fell quickly."
Main claims: Russian suppliers can't hold staff and quality.
Many restaurants don't know what it's going to be with them when the sugar stocks are finished.

Sanction Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed the application of certain economic measures to ensure the safety of Russia, which are called mainly products sanctions.
In the country it is prohibited to introduce bovine, swine, meat and subproducts from the household of birds, meat delicates, fish, molecules, milk, yogurtes, creatures, sugars, fruits, fibres, ores, collars and sugars.
The restaurants started a chech with suppliers: the prices for products have been grown, and they need to look urgently for similarities from other countries.
Most of this is said in the dear restaurants from the Monocuine France, Italy, Spain, where the products were put up from the "materin" countries.
The company had to be interrupted before.
For example, when Rosselhoszadzor prohibited the import of the Australian bovine in the beginning of 2014 and a year before the American and Canadian meat.
The suppliers were replaced by the supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the year-2014 have become much more serious.
True, 20 August Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the Chairman's order that resulted from the prohibition of the boys of the atlant and the forels, the lactose milk, the seed cartoon, the sugar cucurus, the mountains and the bullet for seed.
The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be mixed.
Until the part of the restaurants are indefinite.
According to the "East Western" company, one of the major suppliers of HoReCa, the volume of import products in the premium segment was 70 per cent.
"The dear restaurants have to change the menu under the production of farmers and other countries," says Sergei Miranov, a restaurant, the owner of the agency RestConsult.
If he's a boss, it's not a problem for him.
Only we have a little bit of these rounds, and once the new menu can go two-three months.
The trigger from the Brasserie Most Restaurant will be ready for this: to refuse from 10-15% of blad, half of the menu is to repeat.
In restaurants with a mixed kitchen, there is already a replacement of the stone, such as a stack of the marmor bovine - on the beftstrogans, says Sergei Miranov.
"The sugars of the Property can be replaced by Russian, whiterussians, Serbian, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, replaced by the representative of the " East-West" Oxan Glybčuk company.
Swimming and milk production from Property have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
The bridge from the United States can be replaced by a cubic from Russia and Belarus, a seed and seed from Norway, a loose, a seed, a foreign of Belarus and Chile.
The lack of fruit and fibres of the production may be compensated for the production of parental producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
Myronov viewed that the budgetary network restaurants would be easier than the primary segment: whether there are ≥ rups that are able to distinguish the Italian mozzelle from Russian.
Although the Ginza Project is difficult, it considers it.
Ginza Project has several decades of restaurants under different borders and with its menus.
"The replacement of the hour of time," says Mirons.
In Ginza, comments were rejected by sending the country's owners.
Coffee and Middle Asian Coffee Governors stress that products from the Council Response would be more aromatic
But there are many restaurants whose sanctions are not practically injured.
They are related to the cooking of the SNR countries: the Business, the Uzbek, the Armenian and the Azerbaijan.
"In the business kitchen there are no loved products," says Hatuna Colbaya, the owner of the Saperavi restaurant and the coffee "Wey Me!".
All sugars for us are in Russia, based on many birds, couchs, exotic green we don't use."
In Colbai's campaigns, they've never taken any shoes from the menu.
The Timor Lanski, the owner of the Restaurants of Chihone N1 with the Uzbek kitchen, doesn't even hurt sanctions: he's only going to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia will set up imports from Uzbekistan, Aserbaidjan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, it will be a gift for us than the imports from the Year, he says.
From the SNR, a goat, a goat, a mystery, a goat, a football.
By bringing from Central Asia much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek pomidors all know they're cute, sweet.
No one speaks about the Spanish.
Following the introduction of sanctions, the representative of Minselvodhoza Uzbekistan Olimboy Artiko stated that it was planning to increase the export of fruit product to Russia for two years until 2016.
The imports of Peace to Russia almost after the introduction of sanctions were stated in Belarus and Kasachstan.
The Restaurants of the Fastfood, who answered the Demand, also react quietly to sanctions.
McDonald's Press Service stated that the location exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdan, the Department of Subway Russia's suppliers, purchases about 80 per cent of network products in Russia, although timely complexities may occur with the supply of fruit and increased prices for meat products produced from import greenhouse.
The "Saturation Products" was not more than 4 per cent.
They haven't cut the sanctions and the walker's laptop.
KFC, Burger King and "Small Card" were not answered on the request of "Party", but other market participants claimed that Burger King's location is less than McDonald's.
Restaurants are ready to buy more chilians than Russian Value East
On his bowl
Until the restaurants are complained that, because the price is increasing, they will even be on the product.
"The prices for the "Grabley" have increased in average 10-15 per cent, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" two times," says the restaurant Roman Rosennikski.
Even in the commercial restaurants, the self-depreciation of ships increases by 5-10 per cent, admits Colombia.
"West-West" does not reject this: "For example, the white-russian milk production was 10-15 per cent from August beginning."
"Brasilian suppliers raised prices for nearly twice, "sure Sergei Rak, the Director-General of Stardogs.
The short-term cubics were 35 per cent.
We wait for China's prices, maybe they're going to lose the burning Brazilians.
In the nearest time in Stardogs, a planning increase of prices will be 8%.
Now and so very unnecessary to raise the prices, says Rack.
According to statistics, the growth of the committee for the second quarter of 2014 was 1.8 per cent.
It's the smallest indicator after 2010.
The different prices will continue to grow, but it is not understanding how quickly: until the majority of restaurants were reserved by products for nearly two months in the hope of overcoming the overfalls of the purchased prices.
But what's going on in two months, no one's worth it.
At the border before the sea of Moscow, there are ten trees decorated by green and tree.
In the center of the scene, the walls are playing.
It's a professional of regional products called "There's time."
"We've been going to make a feed celebration for a long time, and this is just a time of sanctions, we've done, organs," says one of the organizers.
On the scene with the Greek Anastas wheel prepares a salat from macarons and households, the class was for the day to prepare a caramulated eggs.
All of the Russian products are assured by the organizers.
In the tabernacles, Russian peoples' achievement.
Meat from Basquiria, olenine from Salehard, fruits from the "Subhoza name of Lenina", a sugar from the wounding Italian Jay Cloose.
"Loss for restaurants can be quietly replaced by another fishing fish from the Next East," says the owner of the fishing "Your people" Philip Galkin.
We're catching anger, a chat, a kitchen, a bullet, a cow, a cow, a king's lobster.
Yes, they're not like the Norwegian lake, because it's a wild fish.
The Norwegian lake is the same aquaculture.
You're taking him in your hands, he's not even shooting.
And you will not keep our remote-easts in your hands.
It is only replaced by the Italian patriarch
In the vitrine of his tabernacle, there are beds with the magazine "Magadan", the tissue, the hole, the muxon, the medium with Krim, the neighborhood from the East.
Galkin's sure it's time to go to fish from the Next East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tonnes, a significant part of fish is going to Japan, Korea, even in the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800 billion tonnes.
Since 2012, "They people" worked, sales of fish through the Internet store, before the introduction of sanctions has served a half of the decades of restaurants, such as "The Fine Affairs".
There are 15 other restaurants who have been requested to Galkin.
The same sugar can be done from our fish, he's heavy.
We were married, trying different recipes.
Now we're selling sush through the Internet store for a million robbery per month.
Our fish was made for several times, and the delivery is 15 bullets per kilogram.
I'm ready to get the Philadelphia box with the kat in the Galkins tent.
In contrast with the roles of the seed, these must be more fed, but the knowledge of that our fish is a parental force.
On the "Your People" site, there are even roles from the pool and the sea eye.
In sushi-barah, truly, the replacement of the Norwegian loose is preferred by Chile.
Gallkin explains this by making new recepts with a remote-east fish.
"The Russian supplier fish has not yet been ours," explains Killfish Bar Dmitri's owner.
Similarly the same situation and with other products: Russian producers could take the released neck, but that does not happen.
According to the founder and owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Aquinov project, we can now speak more about the replacement of imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are major transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace the prohibited imports, other than our farmers.
It means that the prohibition is first to win the major producers of other countries," says Aquim.
However, in the last month, the restaurant growth has received a more concernful signal than the product sanctions.
Three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ecaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the court of the proposed claims for the definition of the responsibility for the most opening of restaurants for visitors," said the "Finans" in McDonald's press service.
No one really understands what's going on.
If all are under product sanctions, it is one alternative that can be survived - says in the terms of an anonimity of the company in the Restaurant Consulting.
But if they start closing McDonald's throughout the country, the scenario will be fully different.
The "Euro protocol" place of the GIDD Assistant
Payments on the casco can be received without the GBD, so the BC will stimulate the introduction of the Euro Protocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidelines which from 1 September of this year will be able to take a reserved car without assisting GIDD.
That's true, and it's only about the cases when the appeal was formed by the "Euro Protocol" without the participation of the road police.
I mean, if only two cars were involved in the DTP, there was no physical damage to persons, the damage is not exceeding the fixed limit, and both drivers agreed to who the offender was.
From 2 August, the payment limit for the Euro Protocol is 50 billion rubs and from 1 October in Moscow, Sankt Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Lenningrad areas it will be increased to 400 billion rubs.
It is that it is often even in the case of increasing damage, in the situation where the DCP can be formated by the " euro protocol" leaders who are in the aircraft.
Because, in the case of the police, there was a refund without the GIDD.
The options set out in the draft indications are called to eliminate this interruption in the way of introducing the " euro protocol" in Russia.
According to them, the cask payment of the DDP without the GBD should not be lower than the "Euro Protocol" limit.
But with that, it can not be above the limits set out in the Casco Insurance Agreement.
The idea, of course, is theoretically able to broadcast both the DPS and the roads.
But mostly, it doesn't come to an insult or a car or a warrant.
The last men now speak of a serious threat of growth of the weight, which can lead to the introduction of new payment rules on the cask.
What the leaders are able to make, it is difficult to determine what will be done in order to overcome Russian conservacy.
The leader in most cases will be waiting for hours to form a small airport because it is so confident.
And it is not yet easier to win the movies or to convince the leaders of the "Euro Protocol".
The certificate shall be nominal and unrecognisable
Minfin wants to prohibit the provider's certificates, so he will allow banks to make them an analogue of unnecessary contribution.
Minfin will prepare a legislative project that will prohibit certificates to the provider.
In recent times, this instrument is a population's capacity, since the taxes are above than the bank contributions.
The fact is that the supplier's certificates are not subject to the contribution insurance system, and the bank is involved in the advantage because it is not necessary to calculate the Agency ' s Agency ' s contribution insurance.
The importance of the situation is that this step is planned to take place because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and suffer Sberbank and Moscow banks, which, according to the ASCB evaluations, control 98 per cent of the private market.
The Bank of Moscow, according to the calculation of the agency, consists of approximately 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASCB, is that clients of a small bank buying such a certificate are trying to get money in the ASCB.
The holders, not having sufficient financial software and buying certificates on the provider, may suggest that their attachments are safe.
The absence of insurance on these certificates may lead to disappointment and pressure.
The Agency has occurred when the provider's certificates were trying to find a safe refund through the court," said the ASCB.
The problem, of course, is stupid.
Because the purchasers of certificates will still be no one, because they have no right to recompense from the State under the law.
If the case was that the instrument was not insured in the ASCB, it would also prohibit metal accounts on which the citizens were considered in the grams of one of four metals: gold, silver, plates and paladry.
Because these accounts are also not in the contribution insurance system, but they are trying until no one tries.
The fact is, mostly, that the certificates of the provider I are a very valuable book, which can actually be expressed in the role of Quasiden.
Their movement is practically not controlled: any bank client may buy a certificate, send to any citizen, and before the finding of such a certificate can change the hosts.
The legislative project does not state that the certificate must be the exact value of the depositation.
In order to submit the pilot to the banks, such certificates will be allowed to be issued without the right to delay.
It means an analogue of an unnecessary contribution to which banks have been discussed for a long time.
NATO Sammit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff

Two Unions
The negotiations at the highest level in Minsk did not solve problems for which they were called, but were born a new format: the first § of the Union were met with the first places of the future Asian
The EU leaders and the Tamoon Union first discussed a number of " burning problems".
Whether such structure is to work effectively, incomprehensible; therefore, clearly who has drawn off the boxes from this sammy.
Questions on this account from the event on the evening of August 26, when the Belarus and after them and the other Jews with the peers saw in television by the new President Lukaschanko.
The Belarus leader showed an example of a determined behaviour, it was the behavior of a man who just washed a jackpot - and planned a valuable age in the higher society.
How Maydan Lukaschenko helped
The coming to Minsk against the three main Commissioners (the EU-ministers) who met Lukaschenko and allowed him to express the final brifish in their name - not simply the president's 20-year-old stage.
This is a request to recognize Minska by the full-dominal Subject of Peace Policy and the main Ukrainian crisis mediator.
The older analysis of the Belarus Institute of the Medical Studies of Denise Milians is sure that Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk the same tone as before.
"What Catherine Estone met the teat with Lucashenko, it gives the idea that the EU will continue to be disturbed," he said, "Feed."
This is a hidden part of the issberg: the preparation of the Belarus authorities began long before November Maydan in Kiev in 2013.
"The results of the EU were successful negotiations on the simplification of the visibility regime and the readmission, the modernization dialogue, - recalculates the " Fire" council - and the United States had negotiated international security negotiations.
The States even took some sanctions.
As the Ukrainian events, they themselves and their response to the leadership of Belarus were only highlighting this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, was able to keep with Ukraine too heavy to not lose much in the mutual trade, but the President Poroshenko could come to Belarus.
On the other hand, the Belarus leader, who dejure did not recognize the Crime Association to Russia and invited Professional Populars in Donbass to be strictly disturbed from Moscow.
Minsk has not gone out of the Thamogen Union, nor from the ODCB, but the Russian airbaz is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted a balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and evaluated it with the sure Belarus experts.
The successful movement of Lukaschenko to the political division will be shown as often at the next time Minsk should take meetings in the EU+TS.
In the press service of the EU High Representative on External Policy and Diplom of Catherine Estone, it was not possible to respond operationally to the issues that Brussels expected from a new form of relations.
Press Secretary Estron Maya Cosianchich only stated " Fire" that this is not a priority on the basis of the solutions to war and peace.
It was reported that the place of the Ukrainian meeting with the participation of the first persons in the new form could also be Casachstan.
As a decade for Minska, the President of Nursultan Nazarbaye was stated, in which he recognized that it appeared to have been requested by the representatives of the Russian union.
Nevertheless, at the final brifing Alexander Lukaschenko understand: All parties do not dispute Minsk to remain a central border for meetings as well as in the form of Russia - OBCE - Ukraine and at the level of heads of States and High Representatives of the Commission.
This means that the "Latest Dictator" has the status of a handful leader who helps solve the global problem.
Best Friend of the farmer
The EU's delegation, including the Commissioners on Trade and Energy, has already focused on the conclusion: the main summit is not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the design of future gas supply negotiations and the distortion of the threats of the TS countries on the Agreement on the Association of Ukraine with the EU seems to be greater than peaceful statements without specific date and digits.
However, the Commissioner of Trade Carl De Guit said that EU representatives "come to Minsk to seek a decision of political crisis, which has economic consequences, not in contrast."
It seems, however, that in the economic crisis in Ukraine is "to" for Belarus.
His consequences - and in the first place, the western and Russian sanctions - give Minsk, which has already experienced a long-term sanction pressure for the maneur.
According to the Scientific Research Centre of Misses, the ex-candate at the President of Jaroslova Romanchuk, Peace investors are actively interested in the possibilities of the Belarus for the supply of agricultural production in the RF in the sanctions.
The provisions schemes for which Vladimir Putin in the middle of Minsk are used.
"The Initiatives of these schemes," stressed the "Feed" Romans, "not the Belarus businessmen, but the Russian companies.
They worked a long time for the supply schemes of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are dissolved.
Russian business needs to restore them, even through the media of whiterussian structures.
Secondly, the expert continues - because many Ukrainian companies are not allowed to set up the production in Belarus from the Ukrainian Syria, as well as with the orientation to the Russian market.
The Ucrainian producers have 4 billion dollars of export to Russia, and the white-russian industry schemes can now be completely disappointed."
According to Romanchuk, the role of the farmer for the EU and the TS negotiations was ideal for Lukaschenko and the development of economic relations with the EU.
He recalls that the loss of the EU Agricultural Sector from Moscow sanctions is estimated at 5-10 billion billion, and the Commission has now offered only 125 million compensations.
The Belarus President may propose Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences of farmers.
This may lead Lucashenko to the EU to a short height.
Accommodation without initiative
Catherine Estone welcomed the Belarus authorities for the initiative on Sammith.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of TS+EU is distorted, and the Belarus leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the initiative of the new format and all of the Kiev.
"This was your proposal to meet, without discussing, not with the bills, to make a decision, after signing the EU Association Treaty, to find out in the situation that was at that point in Ukraine," he turned before the cameras to Peter Porozenko.
However, observers expressed this as an attempt to relax Moscow, which, by listening, was particularly against the Mediterranean of Minska, which increased its political weight.
In the Belarus diploma, the knowledge stresses that the Belarus, in the organization of the EU and the TS, does not pursue useful objectives in its country, but the final objective of such form is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, moves and continues the leading of our Czech Republic's Federation of Russia," said "Feed" in the MIDA of Belarus, a news where they recently choose the words.
In Moscow, areas with an emergency can be displayed
The Government of Moscow considers the option of introducing zones with an invasion as a method of combating the cross-border routes with other major cities of the world, transmitting M24.ru to Moscow transport sea.
One of the options that have successfully recommended itself is an exhibition.
It's an expert opinion, we'll have to study it, we'll look at all of the terms and pluss.
To say that some decisions have been taken for this reason until early," said Lixuts.
Zammera stressed that a very important experience of Asian cities that are like Moscow by structuring and threatening.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already established building of a central ring car, added to Lixutos.
The recently started construction of the Central Road Road is a few examples of the fact that it is not necessarily obliged to pass through Moscow.
If there was enough infrastructure for the construction, it would not have been necessary to have transit trading in Moscow," said the Zammer.
Lixuts also stated that the introduction of the parking parkings was fully broadcast on the staff streets.
And, as he said, the staff authorities are not planning to stay on the ground.
On August 26, Sergei Sobianin, the Russian capital, trained the bookmarks of the first bus complex of the Moscow Central Road Road (CCAD).
Error Success
The film of Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "The city of sins 2: A woman for whom you should kill" did not the revolution that could be expected from him.
The first "Group of sins" (2005), recorded at the minimum, but the symbol of Kwen's participation in Tarantino, has made revolution between films, comics and literature noirs.
Sickwell is also revolutionary: in the meaning that he distorts the fundamental for modern thinking of the tesis - anantisis - synthesis (if you understand the universe Nuar and the antismose of comics).
From now on, it should be read, "tezis is antensis-haos."
"Group of sins-2" a haotic and dramaturg, and at philosophy level: both times he's haotic in stupid sense of words.
Yes, the part of the heroes are known by the first "Groad", although, behold, Marv's grooming (Mickey Rurk), remembers, has ended the life on the chair of electricity, and there's nothing, but it's only able to take up -- in the role of this people's community -- from the air of the knife and other topores with the woods.
But the elders are literally cutting the bills of news, like they're thrown into the city from any other film, about the meaning and the meaning of which the lookers ask not to be afraid.
Yes, his story, increasingly insulted by the most interesting authors, is in the super-sufficient player of Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levi).
Its own is the Eve Lord (Eve Green) and something that has a placed Duyte (J.B.B.B.B.).
But this road, in which Duyte, we say, doesn't distinguish from Johnny, is more than that of the other parts of the body, the persons are wearing with an insolent rule of competence, is not a pain or even a middle.
It's not people, but we understand that it's a noar: a rubber, too confident in itself, a player who agrees in the "medium" sex detective corrupted with a Senator.
Well, and when the episode is ovaling from the acety and the assets, it's not a film anymore, but it's a abstract life record.
It's just funny to put an absolute livelihograph on the logic of the spectacle.
Moreover, even in this suit, there is something continuous in this world.
The first City's fighting shields continue to keep a circuit defence from the consequences of their family forces of darkness.
Yeah, and the look of the kid of Hartigan doesn't, and he's looking at the egg, and Briuse Willis's always happy to see.
The main problem of "The City of Sins-2" is to be another.
Frank Miller was a good idea that as a talented soldier associated comics and noars, and as a register, he turned the idea of how to carry comics on the screen.
Comics and noirs are two aggressive "reality".
The female comic was born at the end of the 1920s, and when the Romans of Dashila H¤meth "Cravawa Tanva" (1929), "Maltian Shool" (1930) and "Steckle key" (1931) were created a canon of Nuara, named "Har-boiled school" - "Create School".
Well, or pulp fiction.
Comics gave Hollywood many decades of heroes: from the Popay sea, the spinner, who gave him the rich power, Superman, Bethman and Dick Tracy's shop to Ha, Tora, Man-pauka and other "masters".
But in any film on comics motivation, there was something dangerous: the designed persons did not want to grow in the screen flesh, remained increasing in their "real" world's wills.
Moreover, they were pretty "existence".
In contrast, the world literature is the most exhistant genre.
After World Wars, the traditional roman has lost the convincency with anxiety, nature, family scandale and historical background.
What Forsite, who are Tibo and Rugon-Makkari, even Bolkon and Rostovi, thinking after Verden, Ascim and Hirosim?
This is a peaceful mut in the form of a milk of oper, and the criminal is, by definition of the marginal, the roman has grown up to the level of philosophy.
He'll have learned what it's to work as a sanitary at the front.
He was a communist.
Instead, they were at least close to the company and the chair of the Genre, such as the writers of Horas'a and Jim Tompson, registers of Jul Dassen, Joseph Louzie, Edward Dmitrick.
That's why the noir, which they have given, first, grass and cyclic, and second, is totally social.
It's almost an American sociealism warrant.
The first "Group of sins" was noticed exactly that it was anti-natural but organically associated comics with noir.
First on the screen, the comic survived, without disturbing his nature's graph, and not being a "current" movie.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered murder, and the senator covered the monster's son-sadist, was full of worth for the H.H.met.
And the vibratory details of the kind of decorated садists, before the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchidee, and the best, that is, declaratively, the representative of the Neonaar.
"The town of sins-2" is not even a decline, but a radical stylist of Miller - Rodriges before the comic tradition.
It's probably a lot of things that happened because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second "Group of sins", you feel inside a steady layer, in which the snow slides a crap.
Yet, most often it's not snow, but blood-levels, but what is the difference?
Well, it's about the ability and talking nothing.
Because it's only when somewhere we've got somewhere, let it go and on the ground of a crazy bottle, but there's a normal world where we can return the roof of the trail or, we'll say, to the unfortunate parents, that her loser is punished.
But if there is no place in the city of sin except sin, there is no sin any more, but the law.
It's kind of funny, like any standard.
Chaos 'Groad of sins-2' is just crazy.
Justice for the father’s procate has given this little, but a fingerprint to this exact sin.
Titres warn: The movie contains the fucking scenes.
According to the vision, in the most veteran episode of the man's fingerprints, it gives it to a damn humor.
I'd like it.
France's socialists must "forward and bring France into order", says the key union of Frosua Oland
Mr. Vall invited the deeply divided left forces to " demonstrate heavy attitude" to the underlying attacks of the President-socialist whose interruptions have not been approved in a long-term majority of French.

The Governing Party of France has survived a disaster on March Municipal Elections, and the extreme right national front came first to the EU elections in May.
The Question of the Resurrection Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is risked for several counterparty fractions before the end of Mr. Olland's presidential period in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, Politologist of the University of Sjans Po, warned that French people would quickly lose patience if the new socialist of the Government would not be able to correct the economy and the record without a person.
"He has a little time, but the public opinion needs to feel quickly that something changes," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can be worse.
"The town without drugs" remained unnecessary
The Sverdlov Arbitration Court has left without consideration the request of the Regional Ministry ' s Directionary on the Guest Management of the " City without drugs".

According to the request, the statement was required by the court to recognize the incomplete contract of the immediate discharge by the place of the Memorial.
According to the Directive of the MUGISO, the agreement has not been recorded in the terms of cultural inheritance.
The Sverdical Arbitration Court rejected the request, then the appointment was given to the 17th Arbitration Court of Permi, which was satisfied.
Then in the same court the Fund made a cassation complaint to this decision, which remained without satisfaction, after which the decision was accused by the Fund in the High Arbitrary Court, but the Court adopted the side of the Directive.
In 2013, a new arending contract was concluded that the fund was restarted by the head of the City of Roisman.
The payment was assigned 300 thousand rubs per month.
The previous administration of the area has sent it to us from the time to time in which we recognize our services in combating drugs, in respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.

iPhone is converting into a bottle
On 9 September, when Apple has to make its new times, all new refugees in the press are shown on what the presentation can be expected.
The American SME source reports that the sixth generation of iPhone will be based on the function of an apple-compatible project and the visibility systems of Visa, MasterCard and American Express.

And the democratics of Hong Kong's movement are depressed by the Chinese representative on the day after decisions on elections
A group of citizens, loving Pekin, stood nearby, dismissing the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the University of People's Representatives on Sunday has defined a procedure for all two or three candidates to participate in the elections of the Hong Kong's Room in 2017.
All candidates should be slaughtered with the support of the majority of the members of the Exhibition Committee, which probably will be filled with Peking Loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to fall into the electoral bulletin and for the democratic activists to promise to stop the financial centre of Hong Kong with the Occupy Central Protests.
Political resistance is the main source of pressure in Hong Kong, since Chinese party leaders are afraid that the call to democracy will be spread to other cities.
Following Pekin's operation of the document described by China's control over Hong Kong, the democratic activists held a neo-official reference on elections in the Administrative Region in June, and hundreds of thousands went out to the business centre of the city and built a seat.
Briffin Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Office on relations in Hong Kong.
Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the University of People's Representatives of Jang Rongshun and Director of the Bureau on Hong Kong and Macao of the Governing Council of Fang Vey should also be expressed at the series of Brillings for a day.

According to the representative of the Sector Gaza Saiba Arika, the world public must call Israel to answer the "continuing rural activity in the western Jordan and East Jerusalem".
Putin requires Kiev to start negotiations on the "government" of Eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on its comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin needed on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stops the fight against separatists in the east country and immediately begins the negotiation of the "government" region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin was not intended to conclude that the Eastern Ukraine territory would be a part of Russian Separatists, but that its status within Ukraine should be revised to give the Russian region the opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, Pue’s invitation to the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the prosecutive rebels as a clear compliance with which it should be given from the beginning of the bloodproliferation five months ago: Help separatists to take the territory and encourage the Ukrainian Government to give the new announced territory of New York a real independence to approach Russia instead of West.
In the interview of the State First TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the territory separatisists in the East Donecki and Luganian areas, which were injured in March and April after Moscow Yieldex of Ukraine half-years of March 18 March.
Chromel and Separatists recently called the Never-Russian Territory, or New-Russian, a name that sends to the revolutionary days of the Russian Empire's glory.
Putin said that everyone who believes that peace negotiations will occur in the nearest future when Ukrainian policies start campaigns for Parliamentary elections on 26 October and when Governing Armies attack peace habitations in the sustained regions, "illusions" reported ITAR-TASS.
"We must immediately begin the negotiations and not only on technical matters but also on the political device of society and the State status of South-East Ukraine to meet the interests of people there," he said.
Peskov said that Pu ' s statements about the State were in the context of a broader autonomy that was discussed during months with the disruptors in Kiev in trying to disappoint fears in Russian areas that their cultural and language rights were in danger.
Only the Ucrainian Government can give the East region autonomy, said the Pescore.
This is not a question of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "for it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
Interpretation of the Creml press secretary to correct the "false interpret" words of Pu'a emphasized the Russian leadership to the separatistic resurrect on the east of another way than the open arrest of Crime, where most of the two million people are ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even Doneku and Lugana in the East Ukraine, since most of 6.5 million people were not Russian, and the challenges before the beginning of the conflict were a large support for the desire to remain within Ukraine.
The Russian diplomats discussed in forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to determine trade agreements and external policies, in fact, by transmitting Chremla a real control over the territory that would join the Russian main territory with Crime.
On the Black Moor half island, attended five months ago, the Russian military float is located, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical curriculums.
In the regions between Russian Rost Area and Cryme, there are also shakes, factories and lifting vessels that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian Army.
The Ukrainian President Petero Poroshenko proposed during its inauguration case on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, would make amendments to the constitution that allow the regions to grant great control over their ability and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from the view of Cremela and the Separate Responses, in the arms and encouraging of which Moscow is accused.
The last call for Pue to Kiev to agree with the leaders of separatists, as with them, followed the new resurrections last week after the Russian armies and dances entered the East Ukraine from the first peaceful area of Asian Sea.
Supported Russian separatists have controlled the city of Novoazsk in the field of the Ukrainian Security Service that they are afraid that it is the beginning of the campaign on the occupation of the Crymean Territory.
This has enhanced major civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a stational port of 500 000 people, which is between Novoaz and the low cross-country crossing.
On the Sabbath, the leaders of the Union in Brussels were invited to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent of 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of the non-reverse," he warned Puroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign balls are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Sammit did not adopt certain measures; leaders called to collect a project of more serious sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in case of any scale of Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilowayca after two Russian armed armours and 1000 military soldiers entered into Donekland last week to support the experimental disorders of separatists, Colonel Andrew Lisenko, the president of the Council on National Security and the Defence of Ukraine, reporters in Kiev on the Sabbath.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which, according to the information, were held in Ilowian as a result of Russian injury, were exchanged on Sunday to 10 Russian airporters in the Ukrainian territory a week ago, reported Lysenko on Sunday.

The Australian acteurs of Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Ivon Strachovski and the provinces of Melbourne Greko were also stolen by a refuge from iCloud.
The name of the nomination is 101 in the list.
Edelstein, who made Greek a proposal last month, said, "It's disgusting."
All private records and graphs should remain private.
It is terrible that different information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greek, who is in New York, according to the information, said to the new website that hacker attack was "injured" and that those to whom she was addressed "received to them."
It is supposed that the hacker has 30 graphs of Palmer with the former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames where it is at the base with the founded breast.

Only with the jury of the view, it is to endure the rubbers of stolen graphs.
The potential way of clothing of detected nominations is found
The massive volume of star accounts may be produced by vulnerableness in the application Find My Phone.
The potential development scenario described the Next Web resource.
The Github resource has been published in Python language, which allowed to choose passwords for the Apple Find My Phone Service.
This service allows you to follow the iPhone location.
It is used to access the same login and Apple ID connection as to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which the names were stolen.
The script allowed the translation method to identify the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all character summary are followed by the most often used passwords.
The author of the script acknowledged that the number of input options is unlimited in the Find My Phone service.
If the proper security system is organized after several failure tries to enter a wrong password, the account should be locked and reported to the user about the crash trial.
Because of vulnerableness, the users have not received any information about trying to access the password to their account.
Hackers have recognised the password from Apple ID and it is repeated for access to iCloud.
According to the report of the Hackapp user in Twitter, violence was found two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written to it to select passwords.
The violence is currently closed: after the five trials of access to the service, it is blocked.
The resource was associated with Hackapp user and he noted that the higher vulnerability was characterised for many services, but he noted that it had no evidence that such vulnerableness was used for access to the "star" account.
It's not me, plz RT
The Twitter Premier Ministry has shown outside records
Although there is no strong evidence of the use of vulnerableness in Find My Phone for clothes, the use of this service was already used before.
Hackers had overcome the management of the device and needed redemption from owners.
In that case, Apple stated that the cloud safety was not complicated in this case, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, a pre-minist of RF Dmitria Medvedev was also broken down in a previous way.
If criminals received access to iCloud described above, there could also be a password for the Government's head account in the Microloging Service.
The Next Web Resource could not get Apple comments on the conduct of vulnerableness in Find My Phone.

The wrath of the most universal and functional human emotion
The heart expression ≥ is biologicly universal, and each participant in its creation of a body and a group of muscles is not a case, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, found by the scientists of Australia and the United States.
They reported about their openings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can read shortly about them in the Californian University of Saint Barbara.
A wrath expression of ≥ is the low and lowered bridges that you are in the thorough line of the mouth, the weapons spread are the same in all cultures, and make it blind from the birth of children who never have seen it, notes the leading author of Aaron Sell.
In the framework of the major investigations of the project, the genuine nature of anger, the scientists discovered that this emotion had occurred for effective guides during the conflict.
As far as the damage of a person can bring one another, more he has his conditions to dictate, and he brings it to a partner with anger.
Researchers found under and other hypotheses: Physically, people are more severe and gone to the hands, consider themselves able to make other unnecessary conditions for them, and prefer strong methods of solution to peaceful conflicts.
By declining from the wrath of the " trade emotion", the scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles that create a heart-expression should represent an indigenous more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the contemporary, and that it should be the most possible to agree with its conditions to avoid conflict.
In order to check this hypothesis, researchers have been thrown on the computer, where each of the seven elements of anger was available or missed, and have shown them to the engineers.
Although the devastated breasts or in front of the ships were not wronged, the person that was imagined with such kinds of human beings were acknowledged by a stronger physical part of the investigation.
The wrath of humans, as well as of animals, expresss a threat: an overwhelming manifestation of its own power, which requires to agree and submit.
The man split the narrows and takes the mouths with the same goal as the laugh that hopes, or the babe that shows his knifes.
"The wrath is launched by the refusing to accept the situation, and the face of the speech takes a form, which maximally effectively demonstrates the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most confusing thing is that no one of the enemy components is productive, they all express the same," said anthropolog John Tuby.
