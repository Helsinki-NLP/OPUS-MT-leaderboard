Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel price of the Paix
The American President Barack Obama will take place for Oslo in Norway for 26 hours and be the fourth American President of the story to receive the Nobel price of peace.
The diploma, medaly and chair of 1.4 million dollars will be granted to him for its exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and ability among the nations.
The Chief of the White Maison and his wife, Michelle, will arrive in the Norwegian Metropole morning and will have a loaded program.
It will be at the Nobel Institute, where he will first meet the five members of the Committee who chose it in October between 172 persons and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides interview with King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will know its summary in the afternoon at a solar ceremonie where Obama will receive the prestigious repe.
It will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third will be determined by the price in the committee himself.
The White Maison informed in advance that Obama would talk about war in Afghanistan when the price was released.
The President does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he receives this price by being a president who runs a war in two countries at this time.
He strengthened the efforts of war yet a few days ago sending additional units to Afghanistan, which will not forget to underline any of its critics.
During the ceremonie, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 1,1 million euros).
It takes account of benefital works, but he has not yet decided concretely.
His loaded programme will then lead it to a banket, including the king and the Queen of Norway, the Government leader and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reticent to this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned the feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all who defend the same values as he.
When he announced, he said that it would be a "invitation to act".
A defendant of the accused nature of singing
The Police of Litofarice invoked the President of the Society of Protectors of Litofarice.
In several times last year, he called for several construction procedures and requested money from the investors for his personal benefit in exchange of his call retreat, said Alena Romová, the police portfolio of Litofarice.
The President of the Society of Protectors of the Nature of Litofarice is Lubomir Studdienčka.
It is now in prison and risk until three years of prison.
The waste range goods are not in the perfume in Brno
In Prague, everyone can trigger his drinking packages, while in the South Moravia villages you fall on trips at each street corner.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before finding the proper goods.
I don't mean we're not going to trigger from all the waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal advisers of our city, the second larger city in the country, do not care enough about this problem.
Brno is the age of stone of the trie of waste not only because citizens can still trigger only paper, glass and PVC, but especially the number of goods given to those waste.
Have you ever tried to put a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's all a science, which is especially time and nitrogen.
The only place I found for the moment is the place of Moravia in front of Poõena Husa.
That Mr. Underka and his teachers don't see me, but that's a little bit to me.
Without talking about the fact that in other quarters of the town, it isn't a noble.
So to end, many of my friends don't trie their rest.
By the door.
It makes them a throat to get to the bones.
It's not surprising me from them.
Myself, after a party, I proposed to go out some glass and PVC bags.
Unless I've imagined no colored coin rue Kounicova.
Happy, I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That's what it says, the waste was overflowing it.
It's after all the center of Brno, who's supposed to represent the best city, right?
It is probably not too much interest in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hokey ligue that makes the city sorrow throughout the country, instead of buying some additional goods and offering the trie of more primary materials for a more cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could have comforted my impression with official statistics after I had spent a moment on the Internet.
According to the data of the EKO-KOM Society, Brno is actually the worst part of the South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has removed the retraited money and the illness congested
As the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, agricultors or even officers may lack money for retraits, illness congested or apartment.
But also for interests on the debt of the State or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of the next year, states the Minister for Finance Eduard Janota.
When the social-democracy and the stakeholders imposed the commitment for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government would make profits for sensitive expenditures, retraits or congested diseases. "This is just to repeat the problems later, mining the land," Janota said.
It is necessary to know that the interests to pay are more higher than money and that it will be to be refunded soon or later.
The State doesn't really have the choice to know where to get money.
If he does not reduce social aid or expenditure, he must increase taxes.
To all who are currently increasing the left: pumpers, institutions, agricultors.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and do not be afraid of their retraits or illness insurance, including 1,8 billion.
But the costs of a larger end-out of the State - the next year will not miss 163 billion in the boxes, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and with it, the expenditure related to interests.
The State will need money to repeat it and it will not be enough to decrease the VAT or decrease the maternity as the government did in its antideficiency package.
It will also miss five billion to buy road and road buildings due to the transfer of money to some elector groups.
This is, mainly, already decided and adopted, which is not possible for projects to reduce costs.
Instead, keep them, which is not even free.
This means repeating or stoping thirty large songs, and the priority of the European funds is also in danger, guarding Karel Hanzelka, portfolio of the Ministry of Transport.
The CHSSD proposed to solve the financial deficit very directly - it will be able in the dividends of the CHEZ (foreigner and distributor of electricity), which the State has largely and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never sure and that it is not in any case of a powder without fund.
Last year, 18 billion have been shiped from the CHEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends serve to pay the elimination of →logical deficiencies, completion of the accounts of retraits, or are still reserved for the reform of the prepared retraits.
Moreover, this advice increases the actual deficit of the budget by 5.7 per cent of the EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the carnaval of transfers.
The budget for various damage to the victims of communism and crimes, even the apartment of the campaign, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not sure that the State can act without this silver.
It's a lottery.
If we lose a international procedure, we need to pay it anyway, Janota states.
The Minister shall then economise the department or, in the worst case, touch the government's budgetary reservation.
It is also missing hundred millions of States case projects of a value of two billion, which must be allowed to follow online the expenditure of each administration.
The first step will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance had no money else, the project should be stopped and sanctions would have been made, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, the Americans consider a mobile phone that allows the user to move from a exploitation system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
It's enough for a button and you're going through Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the possibility that is the aim of the American VMware society, which mainly takes care of the development of computeralisation software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them in personal and professional
The two will work at the same time, indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in an interview for the computer magazineworld.
It was presented in November last year and it was made a first demonstration ago a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Smartphone allocation doesn't refer to the fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version of journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800日 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously exhibited the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of news for mobile phones is full.
The VMware company now with the European and American operators to test the smartphonealisation, and customers should have access to the 2012 core devices.
Mountain snow penetrates the hotels
Desert tracks are only difficult to remont-pents operators.
The lack of snow dissuades people to reserve their stays to ski in hotels and pensions.
In this case, it is always possible to destroy free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and the New Year.
We have many visits on our website.
Internets park the offers, ask for prices, but do not commit to reservation for the time.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or bottle at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operating from Spindl.Info information portal.
If we want to pass the New Year of his dreams to Spindlerov Mlýn, it's better not too hester to book.
If the economy is given priority and the quality of the apartment is just here, then we can try to wait for a few days.
Spindler's hotels offer only a week's residence for the New Year.
I think they're gonna try to put them a while, but they will also fall and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura said.
Tourism Ingtours of Vrchlabi also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Week of Christmas is most interested in us for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It's still free, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared a few stays from the last minute less lovers," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tourism agency of Vrchlabi may also propose the New Year in Krkonosse, but there are less free places.
The first fourteen days of Fév's face are even well, the remaining winter residences are selling by means.
This year, the interest in winter residences was negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonosse.
People's waiting for her to fall.
No one wants the winter to the mountain without snow.
If the tracks come back for the week, Christmas will also be complete," thinks Schiefert.
Instead, the Horizont hotel at Pec under Snowkou is more than the last year.
We have an improvement of almost five percent.
There are some last places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the vacances of January of the Poland and Fév · also sells," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel of Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking of Janské Lázní is also completely at four-twenty percent during the New Year period.
In contrast, half of the beds remains empty at Christmas in the latest hotel of Janské Lázní.
This year, we have been approved for surprise for the month of January, where we have already seventy percent of employment at the present time.
Fév > is a little low for the instant but since the snow is falling, the interest in living in the Krkonosse will still grow, certainly, has indicated the director of Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonosse's hotels do not have to expect more snow.
Thursday he will make more costs and if there are preceptions, they should be snow in the mountain.
But afterwards, the time should be repeated, report Jiří Jakubski from the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometheological Institute.
United States: Repetition is a mother of wisdom
It even becomes comic, the efforts that Barack Obama, president of the wise reputation, plays the strategy of his pre-deputy on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered as very simple.
When he ended by allowing his learning to transpire so heavyly expected, it appeared that he had copied it to the carbon paper since the Iraqic scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not pleasing to use the expression "like in Iraq" in the text many times, which is, to use the title of the Bush speaker in January 2007 as a title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea to send new strengths to a Iraq consumed by the civil war as "unresponsibility and a disaster decision in its consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which had recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and sustainable success that the newspapers at this time do not speak of all Iraq.
This has not improved Bush's reputation, which, objectively speaking, has left his follower a much more favorable final situation than we could not expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will be played
These are again the campaign commanders who asked him to increase the military quota, including the commander of the Afghanistan Operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even criticized the reticences of the White Maison despite subordination habits.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favorable.
The Chairman has been appealed for three months but has not been a better option, but at least he has thrown up the General of 10 000 soldiers.
It has succeeded to eliminate the promise of 5 000 additional from Europe, even if it was about 10 000 in origin.
What has caused most problems in the entire Obama strategy seems to be its intention to remove the armies of Afghanistan from 18 months and complete all this process from three years.
Many believe that half increase will bring the same fruits as the progression in Iraq.
Despite the fratricide wars in these last years, Iraqian society is relatively well organised and its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation of Afghanistan is evident in the opposite case - it is not possible to count on anyone and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghanistan security forces, used to change the day-based leader's orders.
The political institutions, although officially based, will remain only a powder in the back of the patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is uniquely complex to equilibrate the interests of the various ethnic groups accounting for the lack of clarity in relation to reports, which are still complicated by the Pakistanian and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "speaking status" which is the basic purpose of the operation, is not very real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy makes its voluntarism perplexe.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only empired and is currently at the border of the chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and outside the reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of the war in order to return to the house will bring a real miracle there.
From a political view, the definition of a date for the return of troops is clearly irresponsible because the Talibans will consider it as the indirect of the American defect.
The last sum of the NATO has shown that the will of the Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their electors how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iranian, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a solution to the problem by requiring military force.
For example, there will be an answer when Obama will come to the winners of Afghanistan.
However, each solution of this type will lead to a dramatic return of the Afghanistan situation.
The only rusty for Obama is the fact that there remains three years until the presidential elections, and therefore it remains still enough time for a new strategy, where it would appear to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will not receive more liquid silver premiums
High leaders from the Goldman Sachs bank will not receive this year of premiums in species.
The company announced it to react to strong critics on its salary practices.
The group of 30 main leaders will receive action instead of money, which they will not be able to return before five years.
Actions may be returned to the leaders if they would take too much risk.
Accordingly, Goldman Sachs has thus been in the head of the effort to link payments to long-term performances in Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that it should be taken, indicated the former ban’s investment Douglas Elliott of the JPMorgan company.
The concern is in the details, he's got.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the critical target after it has been placed nearly 17 billion dollars for premises on the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premises will probably exceed 20 billion dollars, despite the current year-based measure, the Agency Re日s.
With the array of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the sector have become a significant political subject in many countries.
Greece announced Thursday that it was able to affect a single tax of fifty per cent of the bonus of the banks exceeding 25,000 books.
France prepares similar measures.
This year women received Nobel prices in all areas other than the
These are five women, a number of records, who have received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave Nobel prices in technical and literature disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German origin of the Roman Herta M.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their partner Jack Šostak the Nobel medical price for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical price was deceived to the Israelian Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for the structure and function of the ribosomes
The last laurate received the Nobel price, the American Elinor Ostrom with its companion Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of the economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not been laurate this year was the.
This price has been given to the scientists Charles Kao today for his research in the area of optical fibres and Georgith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD puzzles, which are currently based on all digital, fax, or astronomical cameras.
Each lauréat received the diploma, Nobel medal and the acquisition certificate of the pünniary resource.
This reaches 10 million Swedish currencies in each category (approximately 1,1 million euros)
If one of them conducts several laurets, they will share the re-resistance between them.
The very expected Nobel price of peace has already been sent to Oslo afternoon in Norway to the American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognised the controversial nature of his resources because it is only at the beginning of his parking and is also the head of a country involved in two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In the delay of its policy, he said that in certain situations war is essential for peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota intended to dismiss. Klaus invited him to Chateau
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister for Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, which takes its residence to the Government of its disaccord with the State budget for the next year as it was voted by the House of Members
The budget and may also be the position of Janota in the cabinet will be in order on the day of their Friday meeting.
Claus also criticizes the budget.
It states that deficit is too important, which increases the crisis of financial funds.
It is the President Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his function on Monday with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law which will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion corones that the Czech Republic should be managed.
Nevertheless, the House of Members validated the proposals on the left and increased the payments of officers, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals of the social democracy that they would indirect increase the deficit of the budget.
For this reason, a violent disagreement has been born between the Government, Klaus and the right of the other side, which makes the future of the Fischer cabinet, which has been made by agreement between the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party.
Criticals claim that the budget, as voted by the Members, removes the package of economy measures passed by the Government of Fischer and which must enrich the State's commitment.
Klaus, who can handle the State budget law but who doesn't oblige it, has stated today in a small department of discussions with undertakers, that politics have long disappeared the "serious problem" of the "incomfortable deficiency" of financials.
Now there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could make a improvement, if it could support a consensus of the larger political parties, the President.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is exhaustive and that the government should submit its future existence.
The President of the ODS Petr Netime stated to the CTK that the idea of a administrative cabinet supported by the CHSSD, the ODS and the Verts does not work more.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer qualified such words of "drastic verdicts".
The Chief of the CHSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolánek is experiencing and that it will exceed 200 billion corones.
Thursday, the CSSD has been qualified for the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood movie
Despite criticisms that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans say that the new film of Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu will expose to the world many things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story talks about sports, races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor repeated in Oscars, incarns the film on Nelson Mandela's life, inconsistently fighting the racist regime of the apartment in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was a 14-year-old Mandela who asked him to carry it in the movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to her, "If I have to care for you, I should be able to see you personally.
The actor of sixty-two years of age, who has been restored from a price for his role in the drama Million − Baby of Clint Eastwood in the middle of the box, has, for example, incarned the leader of a movement against slavingism, himself became a slave, a spectacular president of the United States, even God in the Evan All-Powering Film, but never a person who lives and so important for so many people as the east Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was arrested for 27 years for his work in favour of the end of the apartment in South Africa.
It was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was determined by the Nobel price of peace.
Invictus is an invasive Latin word and is the title of a poem of the author William Ernest Henley in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film ra = the real history of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The President Mandela newly chose knows that his country remains and always divorced raciously and economically after the apartment.
He is convinced that he can join his people by sport and decide to join the rugby players who are among the outsides in the world range.
The South African team will end by progressing in the World Coupe in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story on the large `ran.
I had no other purpose to play this role in order to draw it closer to the most reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was certainly talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be cool before his talk.
The most important for him was to shut his hand.
I realized that when I shut up your hand, I recover your energy, she's transferred and I had the impression of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the François Pinner movie, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are most white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pinner at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I sounded at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pinner was: "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus received positive opinions under the Eastwood real estate, and it is even talked about ambitions for Oscars.
The Todd McCarthy movies critics of Daily Variety's newspaper resumed its appreciation in these words: "This is a very good story, a very good film."
In film evaluations on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent of positive appreciations.
The mystery of aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians tested a fuse
We could have observed a strange phenomena of an unknown origin above Norway.
The Russian Defence Minister admitted only that he had tested a intercontinental Balistic Zone in the Norwegian borders yesterday.
However, the launch was still a failure and the missile of type "Bulava" that was to be the fierce of the Russian army, progressively became the cauchemar of the Russian Generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the fuses tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, or Bulava has not been involving, or she has been hurt in full flight.
The Russian journals speak of "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but who does
This 13th trial was normally running out at the beginning.
It's only at the end of the flight that there's again decades on the apartment.
It is evidently the engine of the third stage of the fuse that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" enveloped the nuclear submarine Dmitri Donskij, which was shiping under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be just placed in fire of a move-in-boat envelope
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by a flying object that was not identified exactly was identified by a defectuous "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt that it was a Russian zone.
The generals claim that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the fuse have resisted and the avariah has only touched the third.
In the events, the engines have experienced disasters on the first stage.
Although no of the test launchs had been made without acrocs, the Defence Minister's direction considers that only six over thirty were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent, therefore, uses the optimism generals, and they always say that one day "Bulava" will steal without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersensitive nuclear novels of a total weight of 1,15 tonnes.
The Secretary Fetissov signed at 51 years a contract with the CSKA Moscou
Defensor Viatcheslav Fetissov will be presented again in a professional match at 51 years.
The ancient world champion, olympical champion and the Stanley Cup holder will make its CSKA Moscou team strong in the need and will probably make its entrance in the weekend match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at 40 years in 1998, is the President of the CSKA for the time.
After Denis Kuliash's wound, we need a different defendant.
Fetissov regularly involves and is agreed to help the team.
We must still set some details on the form, says the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not defined if the comingback of the hokey player will only involve one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of the other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hokey player.
In NHL, the Gordie Howe attacker played a whole season for Hartford and received 15 targets and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the fifth Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hokey players and among those who have the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he decreased the gold twice in the Olympics Games, seven champion titles of the world, he triomphed in the Canada Cup and the World Championnat.
In the second part of his career, he also collected shoes in NHL where he had Stanley Cup two times.
He is a member of the Hockey Temple since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the syndicates and cancels all additional hours
The direction of Hyundai de Nošo's motor was agreed with the syndicates for every additional hour.
It is just because of additional hours that the syndicates have stated a rough emergency state on Monday.
The Port-Password Peter Vaniquek of the Hyundai machine confirmed it.
The direction, however, wants to continue to agree with the syndicates on a Sunday that is still working this year.
We cannot reject our production plan, it is essential, therefore, that additional voluntary hours were proposed on Sunday 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, Vanek said.
The Site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company proposed a bonus 400 Czech council to the salaries that would be part of the Sunday team.
It will also be assigned post‐ri for the working day on 28 November.
The company, Vanýk, decided to change the way to motivate its salaries in exchange of additional hours.
Or they receive the addition for more hours, or they can put a replacement conge on 28 December and thus extend their end-year-end festivals of Vanique.
In addition, all salaries present on Sunday will receive a compensation for transport costs and for breakfast.
As regards the fact that the additional hours were the most urgent and warmst point in the comments and recruitments of syndicates as the salaries who spontaneously stopped production last week, the direction took the immediate decision to make all additional hours for December, stated Vañek.
To the last week, car rental salaries were forced to work almost twice daily in more than eight hours.
Syndicates are accounting for the state of green after the signature of the Agreement.
The next negotiation between the direction of the car and the syndicats must be held on Friday after midnight.
The syndical leader Petr Kuchař stated Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of greenhouse in case of agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the car was last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees were spontaneously increasingly on account of additional hours.
They also protested against the bad conditions of salary and bizutage prejudice.
The direction was defensed by the fact that the workshops worked in addition to compliance with car production imperties.
During the announcement of the Green Monday, the syndicates also asked that the salaries who had stopped the production would not be subject to any sanctions.
Syndicates request the company to reduce the past time in additional hours to at least.
Moreover, they want this year a 5 000 currencies (209 €) payment for these.
The Hyundai automobile of Nošo is currently employed 2 000 people.
It started the production in series last year in November.
It produced approximately 80,000 vehicles until September this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on HIV viruss also "durant"
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new combinations that can extend HIV-virus spread in the area.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses who have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality, in some cases, takes the above of the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the core variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the current time.
However, the life of diseases can be extended radically through a mixture of medicines that prevent HIV virus multiplication in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of secondary effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the development of what is called resident viruss on which medicines have no more effect.
The work of experts of three institutions, the Academy of the Scientists of the Czech Republic, the VHCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to face virus opposition.
They showed that substances called metalcarbons are acting on the protein responsible for the HIV virus multiplication.
Metacarbons are a assembly of drinks, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way of all medicines used up to now, and it is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers led them to discover new "bettered substances" based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links on the proteins of the virus.
Metallocarbons have a unique tridimensional structure: two boxes of multiple paroes are formed by bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and linked by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a HIV-virus protein that is essential to the virus life cycle.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by HIV protease, there would be no birth of infectious particulates of the virus.
If you stop HIV protease, you will also stop the propagation of the virus in the body of the patient, explaining the researchers in a pressure stated by the Organic Chemical Chemical and Biochemical Institute of the Czech Republic of Scientific Scientists.
In their travels in the Scientific Journal of Medicineal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two cages couples are linked by an organic short chain, which is then systematic.
A little lower but reliable.
The efficiency of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in tests as well as in resistent variants, obtained in HIV-contaminated patients.
On the consistent version of the enzyme, the effect of metalcarbons is not as strong as on clinical medicines, but it does not refer to the resisting versions against which coated medicines are often ineffective.
The metalocarbons, with their unique action mechanism and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are, therefore, more interesting combinations to address the introduction of efficient drugs against HIV, Pavlína Rezáčová, director of the organic and biochemical and molecular genetic Institute of the Scientific Academy.
Discussion around the budget. The ODS takes it to Fischer, which defends
The President of the ODS (Democrated Civil Partie), Mirek Topolánek qualified the budget for the next year, and the Government of the Prime Minister Jan Fischer should renew its existence.
The Prime Minister qualified the proposals of the drastic verdict ODS.
He says to take time to analyze.
The portfolio of the ODS Petr Netime stated that the idea of a administrative cabinet supported by the CSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was not more functioning.
According to the Netherlands, the Government leader should decide to take up to the Deputy Chamber of Minority, who cares for combating the growing deficit, or if he is concerned about remaining in his functions with the support of the parliamentary left.
In time, it warned that the positions of the ODS and social democracy in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrally opposed.
The Chamber of Members made the budget for the year 2010 on Thursday, however, the proposals of 12 billion amendments included on the left.
The Room increased the money for officers, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's grid towards the proposals of the Democrats was the fact that they directly increased the deficit of the budget.
Czech Republic should handle a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obedient to the Government's desire as a budget is a less bad variance than an interim budget.
Deception and unusuality
The Ministry of Finance Eduard Janota has spoken of disappointment and a feeling of inevitability, President Jan Fischer stated that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
In time, it is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave its functions in case of ratification of amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took the meeting on Monday with the Prime Minister after he passed to the Government:
He indicated at the same time as he asked if he would stay in his functions.
Its disappointment on negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, it is not time to consider that the representatives of the CSSD, who have made the changes of the budget, have no place in the Government.
The Prime Minister should also say fully that he will leave if the Chamber increases the deficit as such as those affecting disease insurance, retraits, or the reform of the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not concerned.
This is the case of the leader of the Government of Fischer and all the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have not made anything damaged, Topolánek highlighted in a textual quota from the United States.
He recalled that the ministers of some ministers claimed to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nevertheless, if Fischer decides to give his demission to fight the deficiency of the financial deficit, "is in fact logical and right that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the House. "
This states, it should not be expected for the support and tolerance of democracy.
I didn't think about it and once it's going to be in the order of the day, I'll consacre it, stated from the Journalist Chamber, the Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was chosen to the government just by democracy.
The Prime Minister Fischer took place in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS went back to the request of the Prime Minister.
At the same time, the ODS would probably vote on Thursday against the budget if he had not expressly requested the Democratic Members to allow the vote of the budget.
We have no sense of being orphelins, we are not small children, has he reacted to the question of whether the ODS had not understood the consequences of the President of the Partie to the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have failed.
I already knew when I rejected my mandate that the following months would be a bulk of the Room and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek was responsible in person.

The history of South Africa relates to everyone, Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood comes in the American rooms in the next days, the title is Invictus (the official title is Invictus: Neporaženy), and tells a part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of fighting against the worldwide apartment has come back to Morgan Freeman, which has been chosen for years ago by Mandela himself to carry it out.
The second male role of the South African campion of rugby was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the array of the film in rooms, the returns of critics and publics are heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the price of Sakharov for his spirit freedom, then in 1993 he received the Nobel price of peace by Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes because it is presented at a time where South Africa is in full preparation for the football world's cut, and, on the other hand, because the media are acted by new concerns about the griping of racial conflicts and discrimination of the people in the majority of black to the power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are in place of a positive moment in South Africa, despite the frequent reserves issued to the main roles where "pavan" of Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of his own terms.
I dreamed about this role for many years, and I was well prepared.
I also met personally Nelson Mandela for power - as it is said - to recover its energy, he indicated at the first film office in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember the personality and message of Mandela through the film.
This is the history of the South African Republic, but this is what each person has rejected.
Bring the maillot of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the British Roman John Carlin was freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the part that gave his creation to the people describe the South African defensor of human rights during his mandate to the presidency.
Thus, during the film, Morgan Freeman tries to collect two racial groups of a long-divised population, as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was among the clothes of the national maillot of the South African team on the powder of the world, which South Africa had then received.
To be shown on the maillot puzzle, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been longly ovationated for fourty years ago in the white public and was recognized by the white people.
Let us hope that the football championship will successfully join people again in one nation, indicated the rugby Chester Williams player, who was the only "swarm" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to see if the tender South African situation will improve.
However, South African whites are sceptical as recently provided in a travel for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who fled to Great Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A valuable transformer of tens of millions of flames in the Louny region
A incendie included the morning a Czeps-transformer of the distribution center near the Výškov community in Lounsku.
According to Lukas Marvan, the port-word of Usti pumpers, there are six units that operate on incendie.
They accounted for the origin to allow the transformer to consume, but they recovered their opinions and stretched the incendie with a mixture of water, mouse and special substance.
The cause is a technical failure, a short-circle of the transformer.
No one has been hurt and the portfolio of Pavla Mandatova the accident does not threaten the security function of the transmission engine.
The damage is estimated at a few decades of million coronas, the exact number can be known once the incendie is expired.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformator must be replaced by a nine.
It recalls that in ten years of activity, the Cheps company has not known anything similar and that the incidents of this type are isolated.
Electrical currency supplys have not been interrupted, states the Port-word of the CHEZ company for the North Boheme of Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industry has not been affected by the incidence of the transformation station.
A.s. Cheps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission engines and electric lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution posts with 67 transformators transporting electricity from transportation engines to distribution engines and line traces of a length of 4339 km.
Jančura will have a complaint for diffusion against three prefects of the CHSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will present today complaints for diffusion against three democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hashek of the South Moravie region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomo-Region Martin Tesarék.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute of Radiojurnal.
The complaint is linked to the tentative of the company to exploit regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have been completed by signing long-term contracts with Cheese railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that we were doing the finish mouths, while we did only a offer for what they wanted themselves.
They suggest that we are less lovers than the Czech Iron Roads that are not true because we know the prices of Cheese railways that have been signed last week.
So, he's not going to defend us anymore.
This is in exchange of calamities on the Student Agency company, Jančura said to the Radiojurnal.
Similarly, he indicated that no region has been in accordance with the European law.
We will prepare for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hashek considers that Mr. Jančura's complaint depth represents the success of its median spectacle that serves him free publicity for his society and person.
I am well ready to defend my name and name of my region and I call the other precepts to do the same.
I guess this will be the opportunity to show that it is just Mr Jančura who manipulates the opinion and brings false and false arguments about regional railway transport, says Hashek.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million corones in a publicity that will mention the defavorable steps of the regions.
He stated to Radiojurnal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas and that he was able to recover it after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would show corruption in a wide sense.
Jančura started his campaign after the regions agreed to grant Cheese railways the operation of railway links for a order of approximately 150 billion coronas without calling.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
His criticism of railway transports in the regions even brought to Jančura threats to a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He was presented as a member of the CSSD, I don't know who it is but I will not say his name, said Jančura to Radiojurnal today.
The vaccination against pneumockeys will be free and facultative
The vaccination against pneumockeys will reverse old habits since January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time facultative for families.
Voices have already been voted, saying that a mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumockeys are cool.
The pharmaceutical institution already defines the maximum prices for vaccines to pay disease insurance.
Specialists also see in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of Ao.
Since January, children born last year from 2 AoProperty can be vaccinated freely against pneumocoke.
The condition is that they have not been vaccinated yet.
If the vaccination has been started last or earlier year, the following vaccinations should be paid themselves.
The first vaccine dose should be given between the third and the fifth month of the child.
In the last year, a fourth of the families voluntaryly vaccinated his children against pneumockeys.
However, parents paid 1600 hours or even more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger ones re-re-doses.
Specialists believe that sickness insurance costs 300 to 450 000 coroners each year in vaccine doses.
However, they economy on the medical care that un vaccinated children would need.
To this end, the State costed approximately 500 000 currencies per year for the whole vaccination of children.
The recovered vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococs are the cause of inflammation of the medium ear but also serious infections, including inflammation of blood inflammation and blood emotion.
According to hospital investigations, there are up to 28 children of less than 10 years of death caused by pneumocoke infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, nearly 40 other countries have introduced the recovered vaccination.
Will vaccination be obligatory?
There are opinions about the future obligation of vaccination.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and facultative.
For example, the President of Nalas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
It has long been promoted by vaccination against pneumococs.
In a international conference to which our Property has participated, experts have not been really satisfied with the fact that we have a facultative vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we're happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it's a direction that has to follow now said Kalovski.
However, the Health Minister does not want the vaccination process against pneumockeys.
We do not consider it absolutely for the moment, stated his Vlastimil Srsenň's password.
Facultative vaccination has its inconvenients, physicians say.
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Specialized Pediatric Society, recognises that a vaccination based on voluntariata's deficiencies.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a decrease of vaccination renewals "In the situation in which the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision to make the facultative vaccination," says Cabrnochová.
Specialists provide that since the next year, more than 80 percent of the new parents will vaccine their food.
The vaccination against pneumococs also indicates a breakdown of the fact that this is the first vaccination of children financed by insurance and not by State.
Cabrnochová explains that guarantees should be released from prevention funds, so they would economy on future medical care.
The doctors will have to buy their own products
However, this is linked to the concerns of practical childhoods, relating to the buying of vaccines.
The original purpose was to purchase vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the State.
Some Members, however, feared that this would allow the insurance to "reduce the amounts of illness insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance to recover them.
According to the estimates, children should individually invest nearly 40 000 currencies per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be far from being easy, Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist involved in a Museum Vol
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognised illustrator, was accused to try to steal tables for a value of 20 million dollars (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interpelled while he loaded 90 tables in his vehicle and in a record.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to force the input of the museum in the region of Pocono Mountains.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, age of 81, is famous for its personal designs such as Conan the Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the press agency Press (AP).
AP cited a responsibility for the police, which the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family chamber.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years old, has been authorised by his father to " enter the museum, in any way, to transport tables into a storage installation," reported the Agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior has not given such authorisation, said the Agency.
The Labour defends the budgetary taxation.
The Ministers defended the taxation and reductions of the expenditure in the pre-Budget report, despite the criticism of opposition, enterprises and syndicates.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling had "not yet" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the deficit reduction by reporting its decisions to the elections.
The Chanceler also attached the footsteps by attaching the lower salaries and the average salaries.
Among its main proposals, a increase of 0.5% of the Social Insurance and a rate of 1% on public salaries since 2011.
The wrath of the Social Insurance
Syndicates protested that the low salaries were penalized by a reception which they were not responsible and watched that "problems" were announced.
The reduction of the social insurance - which will allow approximately 3 billion GBPs per year - has put the world in anger undertakings, because it is a tax on employment while the goal should be a renewal of the economy.
The hedmentation, reserved for those who win more than 20,000 GBP per year, will touch about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAUX PART OF THE PREBUDGET RAPPORT
Social Insurance will increase with 0.5% from April 2011
Economy will be more than 4,75% expected this year
New rate of 50% on bank bonus
The increase in the tax on the benefits of the company for small companies has been abandoned
Rabs of electrical and electrical car taxes
Increase of retirements by 2.5%
According to Tractor's estimates, a person wins 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person wins 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person wins 10,000 GBP per year will win 110 GBP more.
The Ministers stated that their objective to reduce half deficit before 2013 was "the difficult decisions" but insisted on the fact that 60% of the additional tax charge would be over 5% of the first salaries.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasur, refused to increase the tax and highlighted that a reduction of the expenditure was a "country of water in the ocean" compared to what was necessary.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential during the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that the growth of the economy would be renewed at the end of the year.
However, the Provisions of the Labor on economic growth - which will affect the amount that it will take and the speed to which the deficit will be combined - have been doubted after the Chanceler was required to revise its first numbers.
In his allocation, he stated that the economy would probably be reduced by 4,75% this year - farer than the decline of 3,5% preliminary in April - while the price would be of 3 billion GDP above the preliminary estimation.
"Finished opportunity"
The Conservators who will launch this Thursday a new publicity campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of the Labor have said that the project of 789 billion GBP was not sustainable during the next six years.
The Ministers did not present a creditable plan on the way to restore, have they chosen, "chinically" of difficult choices until elections - which must be held in June 2010.
"They had nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Secretary of the Fantome Cabinet Tractor. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" The important announcements will be made after elections, whatever the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour insists on the fact that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the next reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would lead to a faster and more important deficit reduction.
However, the Lib Dems claimed that the money collected by taxing and decreasing costs would be used to support the costs of the next year and not to reduce deficit, supporting that the plans were "constructed on wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC Political Editor, claimed that the calendar of announcements - such as the inflation for certain invalidity performances in April, mentioned above, would leave the Chanceler face propaganda, and the money was simply recovered in the next year.
However, the Labour insists on the fact that additional aid is provided while people need it most and that the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"Faux budget"
Although ministers did not have the detail of expenditure over 2011, the economys claimed that the expenditure restrictions would begin to feel only at a middle-term.
The very respected Institute for Fiscalées (Institut of Fiscal Studies) claimed that the numbers of the Chanceller include substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defense.
"The pain is in fact only reported," said her owner, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after elections, whatever the winner," Roger Bootle, economic adviser at Deloitte accounts.
"This was a fake pre-budget report, and the markets are well accounted."
The FBI investigates the "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest, in Pakistan, of five American reporters, suspicious of extreme links.
The men were arrested in a house in Sarghoda in the East province of Punjab, announced the American ambassade in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI said he was asked to know whether it was the same men who had been declared disappeared from their home, in the United States of Virginia, last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he also searched for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistanian inheritance, a Egyptian inheritance and the other Jemenite origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what are the faces against them and in what conditions they are detained," Ian Kelly said the portfolio, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI portfolio, stated that the agency had known arrests and that she was in contact with the family of disappeared students.
"We are with the Pakistan authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are actually the students who have been lost," she said.
Pakistan's ambassade in Washington stated that men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
This said that the house was already supervised by the local police, and that no employment has yet been taken against the arrested men.
The State Secretary, Hillary Clinton, has made any comment on arrests, reported the Press Agency, but she stated that the United States were "cooperating more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to degradate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and form people".
The five students were removed from their home by their families, in the North Virginia, end of November.
Amnesty condemns the Iranian "abus"
In recent twenty years, human rights have been as less respected as never, the report of the Amnesty International.
the report provides "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the presidential elections of June.
A man cited in the report stated that he had been burned and burned with cigarettes. Another said that he had been threatened by violence.
Iran has denied criticisms regarding the non-respect of human rights.
The authorities claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran, after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has led to the largest manifestations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Douzens have been condemned to prison penalties and the prosecutors claim that at least five persons have been condemned to death.
Jon Leyne, corresponding to the BBC in Teheran, now in London, states that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognised some abuse claims, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak prison centre.
However, since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondant said.
"Fusse confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old student, Abraham Mehtari, who claimed that he had been accused of 'Títalar with Facebook networks' and protested against the results of the election.
"They often struck me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the corner, on the head... they threatened me to exhibit and humiliate me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In aula, the candidate for elections, Mehdi Karroubi, stated that manifestants who were arrested after election were tortured to death in prison and that others were violated.
The Iranian authorities denied violations, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also quoted the case of an old prisoner who said had been held in a container with 75 other people, over eight weeks, in a prison center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian Parliament and the Judicial Appartement establish a committee to question after election and the response of the Government, but she claimed that the mandate and powers of these bodies were not available and that the results of the Parliamentary Committee were not public.
The group said that at least 90 people were arrested during the last three weeks in order to prevent other manifestations.
Ski tracks built in the town park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow have been used to transform the Bristol site into a track for competition.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) reached 16 semi-professional snowboarders in competition for prices in species.
On the top of the Brandon Hill park, a small tremplin was a 100m long track.
John Hickman, studying in the fourth year of doctor, said that the high view of the track was wonderful but that it was pretty intimidant.
It's a wonderful view, with all the lights of the town's striking in the contrabs.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he said.
Prices have repeated the best wheels - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday evening, the snow will be left to the source.

Is it possible to be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laic State.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attractiond by this new book, admirators of the last book of the author, "Why the French don't love the foulard" (2006), a legitimate and well documented study of a problem that has divorced and concernd the country for fifty years and whose effects are still feeling today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen presents a much larger and ambitionary tragedy.
Good anthropolog, he does not just want to know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He has spent many months in the Mosquees, schools and institutions that now provide in France what M. Bozen calls "musulman spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very well aware of hearing and reproducing the discussions between teachers and teachers on questions that are mostly concerned.
Should a musulman marry in a mosquet or madrian (or both)?
Should the development and homosexual rights be taught to the Muslim young people?
Can a muslim woman marry a non-muslim?
Can a musulman use a computer system based on interests for a loan?
This is the practical issues, he states, which are the daily lot, rather than the political drames that concern media.
The author identifys a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all inconvenient of the great public, other than Tariq Ramadan, a Arab Muslim who was born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good muslim and a good citizen in a modern lac society.
They don't move the debate to the end.
Conservators do not believe in the idea of a French or European islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are usually agreed with their approved avocates of a purist Sunni islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which are a small part of the European Muslims.
M Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the lack of the French would be compatible.
But a compromise can only be obtained with each camp's effort.
It wonders how the French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite of laicity) are actually engaged in pluralism.
According to him, the Muslims have not been punished, in comparison with Catholics, Protestants and ́s who have also made historical compromises with the lac Republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmaticism, he detects a "etrocity of key values".
Islam may be French? After reading this book, we are trying to say "yes, but not yet."
The most shadow view of the world
Arctic changes faster and more dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The ice that is composing it is going to go to an alarming speed, bringing with her a life that can't survive else.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing ships in new open waters, with diplomates, lawyers, and now writers in their tissue.
In the "On a ice lake mince", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, mentioning a natural story of the symbol of the great north, the polyar orchard.
Knower of the history and complex fishing policies at the wallet, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorators who proved to be casting the white ears.
The meeting of Amiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old, who was not to take up the point of his mosquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young worms, captured while they naked near their mother, just killed, were arrested and sent into zoos and circles.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a glorious spectacle gathered 75 ores at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually a million of the surface needed for a adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polyar wheel living in Singapore has become green because of the algues that were put into his spacious furniture.

Mr. Ellis ra’s stories of other writers and historicals and often comes back to the threat that the chassiers constitute on the survival of species.
While prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, murders continue in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter chassiers and the Inuits in motoski use powerful fusilsd asylum to throw their gibier.
Ironically, it is in the most northern waters of these two nations of the chassing that ice will remain the longer.
In his new book, "After ice," Alun Anderson, an ancient editor of New Scientist, offers a summary and fearing the science of the Archtic and a predicting what might be the future there.
Not that scientists had all the answers.
Atmospherists or oceanographics cannot relate accurately to the speed of changes.
It's not wrong to try.
End 19th and beginning 21th, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneers gave the first information on the source of the ice calotte.
The submarines of the cold war then cartographed the changes of relief under this sub-cell.
The satellite monitoring and iceberg sounds are of great aid, but the biggest work is made by enduring men, camping in cold.
Mr. Anderson contains the extraordinary and small world of the arctic ice ice system, formed by saumate water sticks pressed by giling.
But from the ears above to the ice mirrors, everything will be lost with the loss of the east ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn."
Marines, among the six thousand people who have placed crowns on the bursts in Arlington
The first class of De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a bus travel of seven hours to put a simple coron on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Caroline to Arlington National Cemetery to cover the graves, this day was designed to salute men and women who were at their place on one day.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we are able to be at their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If that would be me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that's why I just try to show respect.
He was one of the 6.000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to put crowns on the gardens, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cimetary.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, in the village, launched the memory and other people decided to cover several hundred funers in the Arlington Ceremony cimetary.
Now, to continue a 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife, Karen, each year travel in different cities on their road, to organize memories in the honor of military and terrorism victims.
The Worcesters also found a non-good purpose, Wreaths Across America (A crowns through America), which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 coroners on the bursts of the Arlington cimetary, around Pentagone, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the Memorial for the victims of the United Airlines of Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consequent year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150 000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said that she had made her travel to Arlington in honor of her husband, a dead carrier soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who were sacrificed.
It's a small gesture that civils can do to support our groups, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emitted in a number of warm clothes, volunteers have traveled between the pools and the spread cymetric.
The volunteers have chosen ancient graves, giving the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam war, because these are not so often visited as the new tombs.
The humor was at optimism, while children were playing and the couples stood by hand, with fresh pin corns on the grised graves.
Each round corner had a flooded green color, with a small red papillon node on the top.
Nearly, the silence was planned on Section 60, where most of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhuman.
The United Service Organizations gave 1.000 corones to cover the section, but the shadow humor of current wars used the area.
Some people would cry without hiding themselves, others prayed and family and friends supported themselves in cold air.
Some read highly the names recorded in the stone, while others were stuck to see the small black and white information cards, thrown into the humid land for those who had not yet been completed the grave.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many laughing mothers on his son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield, in Ohio, and had led eight hours to come to meet herself on the grave of Sergeant Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer died in July.
No one should never forget what we are free... my son paid for that, she said.
"How long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
A American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cubain Government arrested a American citizen who distributed mobile phones and portable computers in the country, confirmed the services of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, which has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based on Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as U.S. Agency for International Development and World Bank.
Consular authorities and U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to have access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The precise performances have not been made, although under Cubain law, a cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being "free".
All revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graffites and talks are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of larger bloggers, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commenter that often writes about how they are husbands and she is followed and arrested by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to get ree, but his authorisations have always been performed.
The detention of a American citizen may increase the tensions between the Government of the brothers in Cuba and the administration of Obama that continues a "douce" approach to improve the relationship with the island.
The arrest announcement was reported by the New York Times, Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cubain Government will progress through concrete steps, such as freedom of political prisoners and create more space for opposition, so that the United States can make the same.
Mobile phones and mobile computers are allowed in Cuba, although it is new and desired in a country or the average salary of a officer is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cubain government granted the citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation corresponding to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in the luxe hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some imperfect governments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to join often have their name to the Government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of a American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare Americans captured in Cuba are behind the barriers for crimes such as drug traffic, Gloria Berbena, pressed to the U.S. Interests Section in La Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big error.
A activity that, in any other open society, would be authorised -- freely distributing mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, stated Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americans Group of Human Rights Watch, which recently made a serious report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as a leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother.
According to Vivanco, a accused is often arrested, passed in judgment and arrested on the same day.
He said that any solution would be probably political and that the Cubain government often causes a negative reaction to the United States, while both countries begin to improve a better dialogue.
Pakistanian authorities prevent a complaint to send men to Afghanistan
Samedi, the Pakistanian authorities have made an organization intended to prepare a complot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American groups, saying that they would hope that this case would allow an important network of terrorist recruitors to demonte the Internet for the search of young people radicalized.
The investigators claimed that they had expelled a hidden insurance person, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after they had discovered when one of them made comments that approved the terrorist vague on the YouTube video site.
In Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them join the rebuilt region of Pakistan's tribe, Al-Qaida's house and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistanian secret services that was informed about the case said Saturday that Saifullah had not succeeded to convince Al-Qaida's commanders that these men did not participate in the complex of the case to infiltre the terrorist network.
Thus, they have been isolated for days in the East town of Sargodha, far from North East mountains, became a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered as infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, a representative of the authorities expressed the condition of maintaining the anonymity due to the confidential character of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that men were determined and that they still tried the authorisations necessary to enter into the Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistanian law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are asked by the FBI -- involves the crucial role of recruitors in the identification of potential terrorists and may be more important, in the determination of people who have confidence in them.
From 11 September 2001, American secret services have been priority for infiltrating men in the al-Qaida network.
Organization recruitors play the role of barrier guards, which includes those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spy.
According to the analystes, the American potential recurs are studied from nearby by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, expert of the NEFA Fund based on the United States, stated that terrorist groups should also make more attention in these last years in the choice of people they accept because the American secret services have become experts in relation to their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow his model of recruitment as many others have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is the one who is more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protestants in Copenhagen request a "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of protestants walked in the streets, here on Sunday, and asked for a more important action on the climate of the negotiators working in the Congress palace of the Bella Convention Centre of the city.
The number of demonstrants was estimated to 100 000 persons, more than 25,000 per cent of police estimates.
This event was relatively peacefully developed, although a small number of masked activists had allocated some explosives nearly one of the governmental imponents in the center of the city.
On that day, when a little thing occurred during the debates on the climate sponsorized by the United Nations, thousands of activists traveled through the city, deploying pancarts with 'It is not a planet B' and a Spanish, saying, 'The Earth says it'.
Several collections joined protests, including the top model and photograph of the Danish, Helena Christian, who said to travel to his mother's birth country, the Peru, opened his eyes on the challenges that the country must face because of the impact of the climate changes already occurred."
It is one of the reasons for which I decided to join the great walk -- to make the word passed and to launch a call for the leaders of the world to make righteous, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not a easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 persons for the reason they had taken a mask or had a pocket cotton.
The police prevented the demonstrators too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 persons for the reason they had taken a mask or had a pocket cotton.
According to an employee who requested to maintain anonymity because of its implication in the climate discussions, the activists who were carrying out black masks and clothing have allocated several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen that is around some ministers.
They threw them near the immortals, he said, 'They were all over the streets, followed by 'a big explosion'.
Inside the Congrès Palace, people were gathered around TV-rans to follow the way, in the midnight.
But it is that demonstrators have not been able to wake up the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, the representative of China for climate.
When he was asked if he thought that a manifestation would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied: "In fact, that's something I didn't know.
Then he continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that walking could be difficult or useful for the perspectives.
It shows the interest of the large public and the various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or that they hurt the freedom of others."
The results of the tests show tenace differences between races
The Federal Report of the last week on Mathematical results has brought good news to the schools of Washington D.C.
Although the District remains far behind the heading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are increasingly progress in the two years older than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the recent numbers of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Progress Assessment) are the persistent art between the results of African and white Americans at the local and national levels.
The average results of white children in Grade 4 (cm1) to WashingtonD.C. have increased in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African classmates have only increased three points from 209 to 212.
The successful art has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African Americans in Degree 8 (4th) remains generally consistent, falling from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of white was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The view of enemy on a six-year period is not more encouraged.
In 2003, the art between black and white in grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP of the District report was held, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results received by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defendants in the District expressed anxiety that the growth collected by the Michelle A. Rhee group of educational institutions and the Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democracy) had been propulsed by the white students who had already been good elements.
This would mean that we have highlighted the appeal by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is a problem and genetic element, said Jeff日ith, D.C. Voce, a non-governmental group that defends the equality in the District Education.
I am not glad for one or two winned points, said Kwame R. Brown (democratic appearance), member of the Council of D.C., whose daughter is in Grade 4, to Eaton Elementary (elementary oil).
Often critical to Rhee's management, Brown stated that the message of test results is that the middle schools (schools) of the city need a deep need of attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what is fearing is that we don't consacrate enough time and energy at our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
For example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, viewing the schools of the final classs of the elementary cycle and starting age that have not integrated the bases of reading before in their school parking parks and who are quite late in relation to their friends.
Each day, the matematic program for childrengarten (maternelle) classs at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, such as they were placed in the District by the old responsible Clifford Jay, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we must continue to work to offer better interventions to these level level levels, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP are the question of whether Rhee can continue to highlight the general results of the system by providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the art.
It's a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the Berkeley University in California who studies the results of the town tests.
The Conventional Political Solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest quarters of Washington.
This goal can therefore have political impacts that lead to this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other Superintendents of Schools, it is trying to use the average white and black class.
We are going to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our quarter schools in order to ensure that all families, whether or not where they are originating, will be able to make their children a good education.
Janey, now Superintendent of the Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce successful art was the duration of the traditional oil, today 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with the Charter Schools.
Nearly 200 days are required to have the strength to change, Jany, who has agreed with the syndicat of his teachers last year for ↑ 185 days, that he considers a "commitment point" for another increase in the next contract.
Make the higher education a future promise
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long slip.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descending and climbing a moment from the eyes in the view of white columns, fashions of bricks and green powder.
Graciela's parents could only end school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never put his feet on a university campus.
Thus, while she and other students in Grade 8 (4th) of the group exploded Gettysburg where the school costs are $38.690 per year, her attitude was less than the one of a new impressive student than an enthusiast.
Super Here I'm going to study! Graciela who wanted to study the doctor, while the leader was leading them to the input of the scientists.
Youpi, really? says she dreamed, when we indicate her the low teacher of law - student.
The Pennsylvania University was the seventh who visited children during their three-day journey and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not to know if you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still large for the number of American children born by Spanish immigrated parents who left the school where parents became adolescents, they are also hundreds of thousands of benefits from university education that will allow them to enter the average class.
In fact, "a Spanish of the " Second Generation" on five-fourth school studies -- a significant success if both of their immigrated parents, most of Mexico or Central America, were entered into the United States without finishing the school.
Their success is important, say researchers, they open the way to the following generations that will play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers who study the students claim that these have a natural affection with oil and a need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high targets for their children and find ways to acquire their absence of familiarity with the American schools.
The mentorate programmes also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like it to reach the university - especially if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low home homes with parents who do not have experience and skills to help them navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, Patricia Gándara, researcher in Davis, California University, who studied Latin-American students.
We need to think to provide a network of support for these children, from mother and school.
The Federal Programme that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known under the name of GEAR UP (preparation you) , he provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize preparation programmes at the university that start when students of low-leaving families are in the middle school (school) and continue until the end of the school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent of the United States Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of the Iraqian Petroleum has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqian government has succeeded to attach important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two businesses that ended Sabbath.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqian Oil Minister with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and Europe's Oil Companys are to play a major role in the Iraq Petroleum Oil Industry, invalided by ten years of war and sanctions.
The American companies are distributed with a share in only two of the 10 business areas.
Seven American companies were paid to participate in the second meeting that started Thursday.
The only one who had put an inch was lost.
Two American companies have received contracts for the fields in June.
The low representation of American petroleum genders in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq was surprised.
The Iraq finally opened his doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are Asian and European companies who open the road, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a website of information on the Internet.
There will be a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The security concerns, corrupted by mass-coordinated bombardements, on March, and political instability, while the American military groups departed from the United States Oil Society, preventing them to enter more force in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserve in the world, states the analystes.
In some cases, the United States companies were disvantaged because of their owns, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose work costs were not less and who were more ready to take risks because they did not take account of shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and O^al Petroleum Inc. were the only American contracting companies with the Ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhi, who have held strong links with the Ministry of the Iraqian Oil and have provided their technical advice to him, are distributed empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main actors in two of the contracts assigned this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp, arrested by the State, has more entered into contracts than other companies and is distributed with important participation in contracts for two main areas.
We all know that China is being a major economy, as well as a power, said Assam Jihad, portfolio of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to submit undertakings made offers that were then compared to the tariff by bar that the Ministry agreed to pay to motivate the production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of Al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
He said that a American missile, who struck the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of Al-Qaida operations this week, stated Friday from the American authorities of the anti-spinage.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders of this automne.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs sosped of being killed by a couple of missiles killed in their car, March, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, of American sources and Pakistanian authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles were carried out by an aircraft without pilot of the type used by → within the anarchical tribe border of Pakistan.
They drived a white car, moved to the Afghanistan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the Pakistanian civil secret services, expressing on the Miran Shah phone.
The representatives of the Authority stated that the suspicious local soldiers were priorities and quickly confiscated what remained "inclusively disappointed bodies".
It was totally impossible to the local authorities to check the identity of victims, but the two American anti-Terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of Al-Qaida military organizational responsibles who managed terrorist operations from the outside of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to make complaints throughout the world, acknowledged one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonymity, quoting the sensitive nature of air fractions within the Pakistanian territory.
Because of its central role, this was probably involved conspirations against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic consigns of Al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for potential terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority stated that Somali had rapidly progressed in the Al-Qaida's ranges and had very good relationships with other extreme groups in the region.
It may not be known by the large American public, but it does not reduce the threat that it is for us and our aliens, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important person of Al-Qaida or the second leader of Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Nammuddin Jalolov, leader of a military factor in the tribe, as well as three other operators.
The rythme of the attacks made by the drones of the → has decreased since the east, from about six operations per month to two, and the numbers advanced by the Long War Journal, a moderate web site by a non-lucative group.
This decline may be caused to improved tactics from terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability, even by killing impitoy* the suspicioy informers, states the site.
The United Nations Special Sender to Kaboul returns
The special sentence of the United Nations to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would leave his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate of corruption delegations extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The Eid department intervenes while Obama's administration decided to send 30 000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations sentence said that he supported this increase, but he expressed his concern regarding the United States calendness for a retreat of groups that would begin in 18 months and that would force the other governments of the NATO to restore their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to Afghanistan and remind them that they can trust in the international community, said Eide in a phone maintenance of Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officers in Afghanistan.
The military enforcement must be copied by civilians, said he.
Eide said he would not leave but simply respect the commitment he had taken against his family in March for only two years to Kaboul.
He said he wanted to preach the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was an empty two months between the department of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started searching for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is a citizen of Italy-Switzerland who recently presided a United Nations mission in Bagdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who managed the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former assistant, Peter W. Galbraith, accused of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and desimulating evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allocations, but he said that Galbraith's commitments -- which was thanked -- were threatened to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism in relation to the international observation of elections.
Eide stated that he had proposed the nomination of a civil representative in order to coordinate the secours of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted on the United Nations Responsibles to authorise their follower to enhance more staff from the United States and other OAA countries than it is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that it would allow them to make more confidence in the way their money is costed.
Eide expressed its frustration regarding the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the weak regulations of the United Nations were able to bring new talents.
The United Nations rules are so that I could only recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't dure.
Gates: Iran must take up additional sanctions
The Secretary for the Defence, Robert Mr. Gates, stated Friday that the great world powers were soon to impose "important additional sanctions" on Iran because of his incapacity to engage in nuclear ambitions.
Gates, expressed before a party of 300 American soldiers north of Iraq, during a week visit in the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, degraded the possibility of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, said he, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such a renewal.
One of the most of the things is that if I learned something in Iraq in the past six years, it is the increasing side of the war.
The administration of Obama considers an encampment of sanctions that would show Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians of the street.
He stated that a "motivation and punishment" could be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "the people would suffer greatly" of these sanctions.
Wednesday, in a statement of the Portal of the Maison Blanche, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in a warning which Iran will face "possible consequences" if he does not completely produce its nuclear programme in accordance with the United Nations Security Council and its supervisory Agency, the International Atom Energy Agency (AIEA).
The Iran continues to say that he wants to develop his nuclear experience only in a peaceful purpose.
In Geneva's proverbs, on 1 October, he indicated that he would represent the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and accepted to leave a significant part of its storage of uro-enrichi, in exchange of despactly necessary fuel for a medical research reaction.
The administration has moved such a agreement to develop confidence from both sides and to gain time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has seemed to have been removed from the tentatives of agreement - in part, the experts say, because the Iranian leadership has been divorced on the fact of committing or not with the United States.
I sincerely, I, the raisement of Iran towards some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually granted their agreement at the beginning of October, moved the international community, including the Russian and the Chinese, to join what they had not considered, in terms of additional sanctions against Iranian, said Gates.
The President Obama set on 31 December as a limit date to Iran to answer the proposals before it turns to other options, including the follow-up of what the State Secretary of Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "accurate sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, the Iran mission to the United Nations stated what it called "unbased allocations" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and claimed that it was agreed to continue talking with the United States and five other major world powers, "to make a long-term satisfactory solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington after Friday, met the morning the Iraq Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the airplane for the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the people's responsibles in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are persistent pressures between the Kurdes and the majority of the Arabs in Iraq, especially with regard to borders, property rights and income shares.
Gates urged the two parties to reduce the potential conflict to avoid all losses of American reduction plans, from 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of the month of ao.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of the Kurdes about the suspension. The American authorities cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, the President of the Regional Government of the Kurdist: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within an unified Iraq."
We will not leave you."
In ancient China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew about propaganda offices saying, "The Mother is too weak to receive more children" and "A baby is more, it's a grave."
They learned so well that the Government authorities of Shanghai, alarmed by the lack of birth and age of the population, had radically changed the direction of this year and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and closed: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no seconds, Wang, 31 years old, who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the unique child's policy in China, which created two generations of unique children notorially with good games and guests, called "small emperors", a population's crisis threatenes the country.
According to the United Nations, the average rate of birth has fallen from 1,8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents of 60 years and more will explode from 16,7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 per cent in 2050. This number is higher than the average average of about 20 per cent.
This is still worse in the rich coast cities with a very educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-old people represented nearly 22 per cent of the population of the residents recorded in Shanghai, while the rate of birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Municipal Population of Shanghai and the Family Planning) said that fruitful couples have children to "help to reduce the proportion of the older population and to prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is on the point of become "as old - but not also rich, however - that the developed countries like Japan and Sweden" said.
A progressive attenuation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the unique child is the most controversial obligation introduced by the Government.
Parents who translate this policy risk to pay colossal amendments - until three times their annual income - and to have a discrimination on the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denied abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced women of a second child to aborte.
Furthermore, many couples have been aware of selective abortions leading to a boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually adopted their position on the single child's policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule - including for citizens, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already unique children - and in 2007, they have heard many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor of the Institute of Population Research (Population Research Institute), at the University of Pekin, stated that the central government authorities recently discussed more radical changes, such as the couples to have two children if one of the partners is a unique child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage birthdays.
In no time, posters who encourage the family to have only one child were replaced by detailed copys of regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to make the request for employment.
The Government of the City has disabled the responsibility of family planning and volunteers to meet couples, their homes, and to cut prospects under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the responsible for family planning, the answer was deceived.
Deceiting reply
Although responsibles in a rural village in Shanghai say that they have seen a increase in the requests for a second child in the campaign after launching, the most town area reported that there was no change.
The community of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115 000 people, always receives only four to five requests per month.
Unfortunately, Shanghai responsibles say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165 000 -- more than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Family Planning Committee Responsible in Caolu de Shanghai community, stated that financial considerations are probably the main reason for which many people do not want more children.
They want to give up their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would worship two children and that they were all authorised there.
But as many Chinese, they have only the minimum health security and life guarantee given by the Government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be unresponsible.
The oïvals think that the unique child's policy is a problem of rights, said Yang, a building engineer whose wife has been seven months of the first child of the couple.
It's true, we're stolen the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Responsible of Human Resources, said she wanted only a unique child because she was one of her own. "We were the centre of the family and we had the habit that everyone cared about us."
We don't have the habit to take care of anyone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Sieian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, said it more crucially.
For couples working at two, average classes, who make the rate of birth, he says, it must be selfish as much as to succeed.
The 20 or 30-year-old people have grown by seeing their parents in the first times of China's capitalists and do not want themselves to have this life-life, he says.
Even one child asks for a lot of time for his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of his social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to hold your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV for a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher level of life, he says.
We don't want to make too much sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for reducing emissions
The conference on climate, sponsored by the United Nations -- characterised up to now by disappointed affectations and mutual repositions -- has come back under the fires of the Friday ramp, because of the publication of a document that highlights the ambitious reductions of the gas-effective gases in the next 40 years, with industrialized nations that are most of the burden in the next days.
The text that could provide the bases of a final political agreement to regulate the gas-effect has highlighted the remaining obstacles as it clarified the road to take.
But it was seen as an important progress in negotiations that miss time, with more than 100 leaders of the world in the next week to Copenhagen.
A special group of work in the United Nations does not say how many rich countries would give the poor to support the climate, current and long-term reduction.
And it offers a large range of options for key issues, including how developed economys and new enormous economys could reduce their carbon production and what would be the highest limit of the global temperature being tolerated by the responsibility.
He gives a great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited six pages of the document, studied a text of 180 pages of negotiations to discuss what the Exemple Secretary-General described on the climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as "the full image".
It shows the direct lines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent in comparison to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries during the same period would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
The countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent for 2050.
The European Union also repeated negotiations, Friday, promised to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support injuries and sugarness or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbale changes have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, representative of the United States to the climate negotiation, rejected any discussion obliged to reduce the gas-effectiveness by industrialized countries, comparing voluntary efforts made by the main economy, if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama administration becomes stronger to China than the Bush administration, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the main developing countries, says Starn, who also regrets that the text is not enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observators.
Stern made its comments one hour after the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the American main negotiator, either missing "good sense", was "extremely unresponsible" for saying before the week that the United States would not help China financially to fight climate disturbance.
With the future economic travellers of the main world powers in the game, weaknesses have occurred simultaneously within the third world and between the industrial world and the enormous economy.
The current battle is more concerned about the salvation of individual economy than the salvation of the planet, with China and the United States, who care about their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist on the fact that the most influent dozens of countries ignore scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were to know who should exceed the costs of the reduction of the gas effects, even though vulnerable countries were more aggressive in their efforts to make the large issuers responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemonie is developed, said Ulate, which is also consulting on climate for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries were more vulnerable to the impact of climate changes indicated that they would continue to press for a treaty obligatory in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that negotiations would be at least to a political agreement.
The Alliance of the Small Insular States gathering 43 members has prepared a proposal of 24-page Treaty, on Thursday morning.
Arturge-Metzger, Chair of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of the small island States has "a political pressure on the full political process" in part by what they are currently unified and they ask for enormous economys such as China and India, to act.
The debates became an urgent case, while the delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the problems in instance before the Government leaders reached an agreement.
High-level responsibles such as the Minister for the Environment of India, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-ministress have come down from their plane and have priorities in the area of the Bella Center to attend meetings in households and information conferences in order to make claims that will be studied during the next week.
The real image of race -- during which 13,000 people enter and go out of the Congress Palace every day -- guitar players have nocturnal spectacles that spend from countries that have them, treat and that proposals are edited and distributed on paper instead of emails -- is a real challenge.
Intensity only increases: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Thursday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We go into the court of the majors, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, President of the World Conservation Policy.
Hard weight comes.
In Greece, the first train at 225 km/h will redefinite the Syndrome of Monday
At 5 hours, Monday morning, a sifflet shot will persuade the night to signal the outcome of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Great Britain.
The first high-speed bathroom train will reach 225 km/h, while he will leave Ashford in the Kent, London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Ministry of Transports, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes at the front of the first campaign of Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Great Britain to integrate an international rapid and reliable train network and to link the major concurrences of Midlands, North and Ecosse to London.
Small losses will become flowing village towns, business travel duration will be less long, and the airport and car to train will reduce the national carbon emissions by decreasing the road embarrassment.
In theory, the three main political parties are attached to this project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and the fear of environmental dangers are risked to broadcast britain lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to make a report of factability for the Government will give its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to make a detailed card of the next stage for the high speed network.
The new line linking London to West Midlands will be drawn in the five meters of the city area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversed.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final train.
HS2 also provides three options for a higher speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer to the pre-time.
The privileged options are made in a Y configuration for which a high speed line will go to West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two or nearby Birmingham, with a cheque going to the west of the Peninsula to Manchester and the Ecosse and another going north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line will cross the Ecosse.
"It will be the best option of performance," said a rail professional.
When it is finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced at 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first chain, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a travel at the current time.
The proposals will allow traveling to 400 km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains of 400 m long and transport 1100 people.
Until 18 trains per hour can work on a London line - Birmingham.
A terminal that can receive 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Since the space limits are given, an existing garage will be large to receive the high-speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offers this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce if he thinks whether the project should be implemented, but longer consultations and planning procedures means that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it starts the machine, the network should be built partly.
The trains will be obliged to run out of high speed lines on the current rails north of Birmingham, keeping travel duration between London and the Ecosse above three hours.
This solution is the best to ensure the transition of aircraft to trains, which constitutes a reference point for rail revolution.
Contributors refund 75.000 GBP for Tory's orheries
Alan Duncan, the main member of the parliament of Tory, has paid to the contributor thousands of books per year to restore the cost of an orarie that he built in his house of his circonscription.
The responsibility of the party who was restored by David Cameron to claim that the members of the parliament were "intained", increased its 75.000 GBP emphasis to build a employment in the second house in Rutland.
It had been authorised to pay additional interests, amounted to hundreds of books per month, to the contributor.
The Common authorities received the complaints at that moment and were not asked by Sir Thomas Leg, which performs a control of the expenditures of the members. Last night, Mr Duncan stated that the complaints would not be "plus or more simple".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, is owner of a house at two stages in a village of Rutland - Melton.
Adventure houses were sold for nearly a million books.
The cooked cook, a room and a room to eat, but the Emouments office states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he had a veranda at home, described it in its plans as an orangeia.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda to please it".
Mr Duncan has not been asked to make an explanation for the employment under a recent investigation carried out by the Committee on Privileges and Common Standards concerning its provisions of preliminary duties.
The Committee was innocent in the last month of any non-respecting rules, after a question of its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan had the legal security of 27406 GBP of his property from London at the house of his circonscription which he bought in 1991, the year before being member of the Parliament.
This week documents show that Mr. Duncan claimed about 1.400 GBP per month of rental interest until March of the last year.
In April, its requests increased more than 1.800 GBP per month.
The rate of interest on Mr. Duncan's RBS premium has not been changed at that moment, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance 75.000 GBP.
The standard RBS standard interest rate passed from 7,94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without moving since.
The last publication of the Common Authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask →50 GBP in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his post of the Fantome Cabinet in September, after a journalist under covering it was told that the members of the Parliament would survive "on budget" after the expenditure scandale.
"In fact, it is now national, you have to live "on budget" and you are treated as "f...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked a little part based on what was right.
And I could have asked more sacredly, but I didn't."
The member of the Parliament, a million-year from his former post as a negotiator in oil, began to explain its expenditure, in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before it was agreed with the Office of expenditure that it could be considered "somely".
A activist cut a £ in the puzzle of Mr Duncan to protest after it was revealed that he had requested 4.000 GBP for three years.
Questioned on the printing, last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for capital improvements, which were approved by the cost office and then by Lee."
He said, "There is no problem with derubate or processing or use of rules or anything.
It was actually, in the rules, authorised, etc.
It couldn't be more clean or simple."
Faithful ones, come to see all the events of Brighton
Brighton's beach cabines have found a new way of promotion for winter months, an interactive event's calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church who encourages the spiritual exploration by creativity, invited 24 owners to cover their cabin for each December, using Noel's songs as theme.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30, each day, with feet and warm wine freely served.
Noel's songs currently selected include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabine presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year marketing TV assistant in Hove, is an unbalanced priest from Chichester and Beyond's diocese.
He said, "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As the Church, why are we waiting for people to enter into an old strange? It is me that the Church should draw close to people and collect in a better way.
"The idea of the event of the Place Cabine came just after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is a so creative and vibrant place, and we are trying to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Force mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Decades of thousands of people have shown the Sabbath to claim an ambitious and committing agreement on the fight against climate relief throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police has been interpelling in several hundreds.
At least thirty thousand people, the police, hundred thousands of organizers, have defiled in cold in the Danish capital, on the basis of the United Nations Conference on Climate, which was charged to break from here Friday to an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Denmark President of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization throughout the world, illustrated by these manifestations, contributed to "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the department of the court, when a group of 300 demonstrants, totally black clothed, broke vitrines with pave and martyrs, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emittent police have soon been intervened without business.
In total, the police announced the interpolation of 600 to 700 people, mainly from the members of the Blacks Blocks, these ultra-violent groups, which were particularly illustrated at the top of the NATO in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the manifestation organizations, described the conditions in which the hundreds of military groups were interpelled "without distinction", highlighting that a hundred of them were always "retained in the Sabbath Street and held in position despite the extreme cold".
Parts of Parliament, the courtage, instead of a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of negotiations.
The demonstrants stopped around 500 meters of the bathing, without trying to go over there.
A scene was drawn to take the proposed speakers, before a guard to the sandals with the participation of the ancient South African Archaebean of the Cape Desmond Tutu.
The majority of demonstrants came in car and was running in large cities of Europe, but many Asian, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Approximately 3.000 people, for most of them in impermeable blue heaven, had formed a first race in the morning in Copenhagen, called the Amys of the Earth, who heard forming "Blue sea" for "Climity Justice".
Today, we are going down in the streets to ask for a repair of the Southern debt, explained Lidy Nacpil, military Phillipine of the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: We have time, we've estimated the Beninouse Kidjo's song.
There are rubbers sitting in Africa, water courses where we can walk as we never had done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, alternative movement was drawn to environmental organizations.
The French Commissioner José Bói, of the Altermondialism, explained to have come to Copenhagen for "lire climate and social justice": "nothing today, there is no interruption between the fight against climate refreshment and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which opens many particularly vulnerable islands in the discharge, had given the sentence of manifestations.
Approximately fifty thousand people, organizers, were descended in the streets in the streets.
In Manille, some hundreds of people, students for most people, have rolled in red, trees of bandanas that win solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, races of some hundred demonstrants have also been held to claim energy action against climate change.
In France, the manifestations organized by the "350" network have gathered some hundreds of people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (western) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, a few decades of people were gathered together.
The separate Abkhazie chose his President, Georgia refers to a "farce"
Abkhazia chose his President Saturday, a little more than one year after Moscow's separatist region in Georgia, while Tbilissi refers to a "farce".
About 13 000 people were invited to participate in this first scrutin after the Russian Georgian War in 2008 for the control of the South Oxetian, another Georgian secessionist territory recognised by Russia.
The voting offices closed at 17.00 GMT.
The participation rate was of 58% a few hours before closing, the responsibility of the Abkhaze Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results of the year were made in the Sunday night.
The five school candidates, among whom the president, Sergueï Bagapch, are categoryally rejecting the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the detention of the vote.
These choices are a cup.
On its hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, "remembers that Abkhazia is fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his portfolio, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216.000 people, while the rest of the world considers it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian groups.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which made several thousands of deaths, Abkhazia is trying to show that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new E.C. as an independent State, stated to the AFP Svetlana Kvar日ia, a 54-year history, who said that he had voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the electors who returned to a vote office in a school of Sukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white bath with some palmiers before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of the presidential in this region to the suspicious landscapes at the border of the Black Sea.
Great panels showing Mr. Bagapch at the side of the President and the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Poutine, are installed somewhere in this small territory of 216.000 people.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the leader of the district, the Archba, reserved a warm accommodation to the Russian responsibles coming to monitor the disruption of the scrutin.
We, the Abkhaze people, have said, during a small ceremonie, in allocation to the support of Moscou, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, answered Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, and raised up a waterka glass.
On its hand, the opposite represented by the former President Raoul Khadjiba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and ihrslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscou last year, as the heavens in Russia are controlled on the abkhaze railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, states not to support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more one voice is needed to receive the selection.
If no candidate reaches this level, a second turn must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Thousands of thousands of people have marketed on Sunday in the world to claim an ambitious and ambitionary agreement to the Copenhagen Conference on the climate, where the police, on who lived, interplyed nearly 700 people in the context of a impressive manifestation.
Threety thousand people, the police, hundred thousands of organizers, have thrown in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which takes the delegates of 193 countries up to 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Part of Parliament, the courtage, globally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations are running.
The demonstrants stopped around 500 meters from the center without seeking to join it.
A scene was drawn to take the proposed speakers, before a guard to the sandals with the participation of the ancient South African Archaebean of the Cape Desmond Tutu.
Some instinctly after the department of the court, a group of some hundred demonstrants, full of black clothes, bricks and martyrs, broke vitrines, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emeute police soon surrounded them and interacted without business, putting many of them on the ground.
The police announced the interpolation of 600 to 700 people, indicating that it was mainly members of the Blacks Blocks, these ultra-violent groups, which were particularly illustrated at the top of the NATO in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was hurt by a pave and four cars incendied near a squat in accidents that led to the interpellation of a twenty-third persons, the police.
In the eyes of the extremist groupuscules, we had predicted the police portfolio, Henrik Jacobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces were turning into heaven.
The majority of demonstrants, coming in car and running large cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asian, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Approximately 3.000 people, for most of them in impermeable blue heaven, had formed a first race in the morning in Copenhagen, called the Amys of the Earth, who heard forming "Blue sea" for "Climity Justice".

We can't continue to say: We have time, we've estimated the Beninouse Kidjo's song.
There are rubbers sitting in Africa, there are water courses where we can walk while we never had done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, alternative movement was drawn to environmental organizations.
The French Commissioner José Bói, figured in the alternationalism, said to the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen for "lire climate and social justice": "then's no interruption between the fight against climate refreshment and fighting for another world."
Oxfam's organization mobilised several personalities, including the Danish mannequin Helena Christian, the former United Nations Commissioner to the repositories Mary Robinson, who should address the multitude.
The Asia-Pacific region, which opens many particularly vulnerable islands in the discharge, had given the sentence of manifestations.
Approximately fifty thousand people, organizers, were descended in the streets in the streets.
In Manille, some hundreds of people, students for most, have shown, red clothes, and tree bandanas that gain solar energy in front of the philippine capital mairium.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, some hundred demonstrant races were also held to claim an action against climate change.

The geo history has been strengthened from the reform of the General School, Chatel
The Ministry of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "enhanced" from the general education reform, despite the elimination of their obligatory education in scientific terminal.
Now, the first-party will have every four weekly hours and the same programme for a shared common culture, Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "the hypocrisy is needed" because, he, "the S filière is no longer a scientific filthyr" but "in large, it's the best.
The ES and L branches can't remain subfilters of the S, and he's still highlighting: "I haven't even heard many stories and intellectuals inside the absent of the history in terminal geographic in the schools."
Samedi, a ifop investigation in the Humanity, revealed that nearly seven French on ten (69 per cent) disapproval the government project to remove the obligational education of the history geographic in the terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some right elections.
The Minister, however, said that it was not "no question" to remove the philosophy from the S terminal programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of the training of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and syndicates) called on a Monday moving day to protest against the project, which offers them the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In master 2 (M2), they will pass in the beginning of a year a test of acceptability that will lead to their discipline, and then, at the end of the year, a test of adoption that will lead to their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will follow the stages in situation during the year of M2 and will be a first year before the stage as stage teachers.
If you add all the stages proposed before the concurrence, you have already received more presence in front of the Âs, or more than 300 hours, it has continued.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in the National Education".
He also reaffirms the project to remove the school card from 2012.
A Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince climate
Fifty minutes to talk about the injuries of the Copenhagen Supreme: this is the challenge that led Sunday morning, Jean Jouzel, President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Normal School Above the Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, as well as the Nobel price of peace, introduced the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of an enhancement of expert interventions, from fifty minutes each, filmed and opened in the public, found an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that takes people and gives them the desire to know more, explained in the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo Conference, one of the organizers of this day, who takes his name from the fish given by the fish from the bassin of the olive.
A twenty-five interventions are chosen among the experts of their discipline and they are selected for their charismatic side, indicated.
About climate breakdown, "We can talk about hours, but we can also speak of key goals in a few minutes," said the APP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with graphics, before a fifty people.
This is a part of our Scientific role, he highlighted, hopeing that the auditors will recall that "Copenhagen's conference is supported on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos taken from these conferences will be online on the site of the olive from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others to a bimestrial rythme.
Payment losses: wrath of prison overseers, planned action
The prison supervisory syndicates called Friday to the "general mobilization" to request the payment of the year-end festivals and additional hours for which the payment was paid in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2th syndicate of supervisors) requested staff who will not be in service to show on Monday morning before penitential institutions and to "lock them" to "none their dus' flight".
The CGT (3th syndicat of the profession) calls them to "congregate themselves in general meetings in different prisons for a strong mobilization", which judges "honorable and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "additional hours, night premiums, dinners and feed days" worked in October.
And the first syndicate of supervisory supervisors, the Ufap/Unsa Federal Autonomous Union (Ufap/Unsa), "will call to the general mobilization... in order to bring up disappointment and anger."
The Directorate of Penitentiary Administration and the Minister of Justice explain that the additional hours have increased much in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that the rest will be paid in January.
The Chancelleria indicated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a court to the supervisory syndicates guaranteeing that this payment would be made in the next month.
I don't know the efforts provided by staff for the functioning and modernization of our penitentiary system, wrote the Minister of Justice in this court.
I requested the Penitentiary Administration to make an income of measures in order to ensure that this situation of a bad evaluation of the number of additional hours is not played in the future, Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the payment of December will be greater, except for the responsibility staff benefiting from primary functions and objectives, has deployed Ufap/Unsa, for which "the budgetary restrictions have good duty".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycotter until the new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and Fridays if those of October are not regulated in December, the same for additional hours, also threats FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvernya.
When our tasks and missions are increased without enhancing our efficiency, it is more regretable to be taken to the debt of the staff, it is considered the CGT Penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to syndicates, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less bad than others.
But in any way the account is not there, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says offers "shooter tricks" than those he receives
The American President Barack Obama, who is ready to pass his first Christmas in family to the Maison Blanche, confided to the "papage" of the small Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule on chains: "I give more cool things than those I receive."
In the context of a special emission that will be distributed on the ABC chain on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle offer a preview of how they hear collecting the end-year festivals in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small companion of four families will be part of the party.
The Christmas Father also loves Bo, thus said Michelle Obama, indicating that the dog would have "been sure" a gift, and the extraits of the emission distributed in the past.
And Michelle Obama was recorded falsely against his husband's statements about the quality of the chains he received: "I have certainly offered you sympas last year," she tackled the President.
Absolutely, has it been required to concede before replicating with humor by showing the finger of the First Lady's perle: "Who has offered this to you?"
During this emission of a hour, in the disappeared atmosphere, with the beauty of an animation, which was a fervent support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the President and his wife also remembered their favorite chambers as children.
Barack Obama evacuated a tithe-speed wheel, but also a basketball like his father Kenyan that he rarely saw offered him to Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, the President said.
It's just later in my life I realized that it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her cup house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the mobiles against the wall, rather than getting them around the road, but I loved this small house of popped, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL says he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reopened in Los Angeles because of important "lesions" after a operation in France, but the situation is "so control" of its surrounding, while RTL states that the song was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year rock was reopened on Thursday Thursday night at Cedars-Sineai of Los Angeles Hospital after the American doctors had found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the discal heritage ascended to Paris on 26 November, which indicated to Paris his pressing service, indicating that these lesions were needed "reparatory operation".
However, the press service of the song was wished to ensure that the situation was "on control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be made at the latest in 48 hours.
According to RTL, a partner of the last turn of the song, however, Johnny Hallyday would have been spent in a artificial coma to avoid "worries and complications".
It's only 48 hours that we'll have a little more sure about the patient's status when he's opening an eye, RTL.
Asked by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or commented the information.
RTL also states that no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rock was operated on the international clinic of the Monceau Park for this discal hernium.
The intervention, programmed for several days, was practiced by the Neurochirurgian Stéphane Delajoux, a very known doctor in the artistic environment.
This was not available Thursday night to comment RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the song was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sineai Hospital of Los Angeles for a consequent infection in the intervention.
The song E日 Mitchell, a neighbor of Johnny Hallyday, felt Thursday on RTL that his friend passed "a bad pass", but he assured that he did not make "no concern" for the rock, which is "a rocking".
He called me just before I was going to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a connery because he was doing twelve hours after such a operation, it is not playable, said E日 Mitchell.
Thursday night, the song manufacturer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to make sure that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfyingly to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endigued".
Mr. Camus had also said to have entered Laeticia, the wife of the song, and had not noticed special concern.
But the sanctor's health concerns have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed has been operated by a "small cancer of the colon", then of a igneer infection.
Final September, the song recovered his long "Tour 66", presented as his tour of adieus.
But since, every health problem has been very much commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the song to move on scene.
In mid November, its surrounding had even to delay a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/peed basin: the first of Bousquet on its feet distance
Franzis Fréderick Bousquet, a medium triple in the Worlds-2009 in large bassin, has cut off a international title on a distance that he especially affects, the 50m free ship in Euro-2009 in small bassin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition, where the combinations were allowed for the last time, only three records of the world were seen while we were waiting for a deferling.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 nays and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 nays.
A lamentation for Bousquet, who was stuck on the record of the world of 50 m free, which holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two royal distants of the nation, 50 m free, it was the French of 28 years, which was placed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten nagers took the department against eight of usually, a first at international level.
Bousquet advanced Croatia Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to decrease the world mark (20.30) as he had considered.
We can always dream better and in the case, I said that if the record of the world was at my place, I would like to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the nagers were clothed of polyuretan combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
In the origin of 238 records of the world since February 2008, these combinations ended their spouse in Istanbul, which had accepted the first in 1999 during the same competition.
The use of combinations has not been used this time to German Paul Bi日mann, a double campion of the world in large basin this is in Rome, records of the world to the key.
The young nager has not been able to dismiss the mark he holds on 400 m free nage (3:32.77) but he has been imposed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danois Mads Glassner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this course.
I knew I couldn't make a record of the world this time, but I was able to defend my title and I completed my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained by Bi日mann.
USA: a sarcophage panel of Zola adjunted 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophage panel, in particular of the French Emile Zola French, was adjudicated on Thursday 1,5 million dollars, just above its estimation, announced the art market of Sotheby's.
This panel was estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars from the 3th century after Jesus Christ.
The marble "representing four dimonisian scenes in a sophisticated decoration, surrounded by satyres and `chants, is a rare park, there is only four or five in the world," explained to the FAP Mardi Florent Heintz, president of the artists of the Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold among a hundred cents of lots.
The sale is still running, but this lot is probably the one on which the purchasers have the most interested to this place, indicated the FAP a Sotheby's portfolio, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola returns to a few days.
The panel remained nearly 300 years in Rome in the glorious collection of the Borgese family, and then appeared successfully with the French actrice Citéle Sorel, who had made it a part of his bathroom in his special Paris hotel, and Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic of France and briefly President of the Council before accessing the power of the Sea ́hal Pétain.
It was a shadow area of a fifty-year.
Following the database of the Museum of Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an open "sufcession Emile Zola" in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérese Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted department at Zelaya de Honduras to Mexico
The Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer assembled for the transfer to its territory of the Hunduras decade president, Manuel Zelaya, which seemed to be a non-conduct by the Pushist Government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, all indicate that the possibilities of this transfer are not gathered, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
Wednesday to Salvador to return Mr. Zelaya, the mexican government's airport is divided to its origin, a source of the Directorate-General of Migrations.
The Pushist Government wanted Mr Zelaya to "release" and to ask for the political asylum to the foreigner to grant him a non-conduct.
But the Dechu president was devoted because he wanted to go to Mexico as a leader of an invitated State.
The Pushist Government "rejected a new failure to refuse my charge..., they wanted me to leave," Mr. Zelaya said to the Globo radio, on which he often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis in Central America for five months.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, playing a few agreements by the Dechu President, repeated to the Brazilian ambassade of Tegucigalpa for two months and half.
Mexican ambassade presented us a request for non-conduct, but desirablely we can not accept it because it does not contain asile requests, stated Wednesday the Minister of the Internal Government of Pushist, Oscar Raul Matute, to the HRN Honduras radio.
I didn't ask asile to any country, but Manuel Zelaya had answered in a telesur chain interview, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible department from Honduras should be made as the president of the Honduras people, he had highlighted.
Mr. Zelaya's department sounds had mobilised on Thursday the parties of the Chairman, who came to raise around the Brazilian ambassade, where military people strengthened their seat.
The Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the Pushist Government.
This demonstrates the marginal character of this government in relation to international standards.
Zelaya, who was referring to the Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been reversed on 28 June, on the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare its election against the opinion of the Supreme Court, Army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he was surprised on 21 September and repeated to Brazil's ambassade.
If it comes out, it will be arrested to respond to the crime of "High Trahison" with the accusation of justice, the Government of Pushist.
The Pushist President Roberto Micheletti has succeeded to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was chosen during the controversy investigation recognised by the United States but contested by Latin America countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congrès voted massively against the return of Mr Zelaya to the power until the end of its mandate on 27 January.

Nevertheless, the new inscriptions on unemployment in the United States have increased against all expectations last week, to reach 474.000 requests.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new employment applicants "is fallen down a year ago," Scott Marco'r, from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The obligatory market has been decreased.

Cuba: Hundred centers of power partyers are conceived by the "White Ladies"
A few hundred parties of Cubain power party were held on Thursday of political detentions gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another manifestation for which a statement of dissidents was interpondered.
A quarter of "White Ladies", wives or nearly political prisoners, was built in a full street by members of the Government of Raul Castro while they went to the center of the capital to claim the freedom of political prisoners, found an AFP journalist.
Below the Yaèes!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionary!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" scanning, upset poing, the partisans of the power to the dissidents.
These were scored by civil agents who came "to ensure their protection".
The watch, a similar manifestation was disrupted against the "Dames in white" in La Havana, without any hurt or arrest.
But in the Hawaiian quarter of Vedado, a statement of dissidents who were also able to show on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights was, interpelled by civil police officers, a journalist of the AFP.
The police forced in civil vehicles the dissidents who were constructed by government parties, this journalist.
Dissident interpellation in similar circumstances is generally only a few hours.
Receptors of the European Parliament's Price Sakharov 2005, the "White Ladies" had organized an unapproval walk to "request the freedom of all political prisoners" in the number of 200% of the dissidency, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda purchased a penal of 20 years of prison.
Mr. Maceda is a part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, whose 53 remain under the locks.
Cuban authorities consider the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agencies" to the soldier of their stated enemy, the United States.
In fact, Cubain television has taken into account the manifestation of Thursday of pro-governmental soldiers against "revolutionary".
Cuba, managed by a single party, the Party, is regularly accused of European or American NGOs to buy rights and freedoms, including expressions.

A two-country armed forced killed a octo-year and wounded five other people in the Clichy-la-Garenne city (Houts-de-Seine) at a hour of strike, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the agressor, age of 28, would have struck with two cottons and for undetermined reasons, an octoginal, in or before a pharmaceutical pharmaceutical of the 85 bulletin Jean-Jaurès, learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Greatly hurt, the old man, born in 1929, was dead at the hospital of his wounds.
In or before this same pharmacist, he then took it to a couple, whose wife was hungry.
The husband, age of a thirty-year-old, interrupted and was hurt.
The first two victims, grewly wounded, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenian was burned.
The days of the other hurt are in danger, living organs appear to be touched, and police sources.
The injured woman then made a disease and would have been hospitalized "in choc state", a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under alcohol or drug imprisonment, a police source, would then escape in the street, always bulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have hurt two persons, apparently at the hazard: a thirteener and a square, this last greedy.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two bottles that he was carrying in cross behind his backs, explained on the place a responsible for the Syndicat Alliance in the High-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Multiple, including young people, witnesses collected by the AFP, have tried to control the forced.
I saw a guy of a thirty-year with a green clothes.
Three young people tried to intercept it.
They didn't come there because the guy was cosud, he reported Alberto, a server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, whereas a municipal police officer who fell down the poignet was able to go.
On the top of No.61, two municipal police officers, whose responsibility, have always tried to interply the armed man and were hurt by poing, the police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arters of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many trades are located.

These are the effects of the National Police who arrested the man from identity papers.
The Nanterre parquet took the request for the Department of Judicial Police of the Highs-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The forced was hospitalized Thursday evening.
He was not yet heard in the framework of his view-guard.
A police source did not exclude it to be involved in psychiatric hospital.

U.S.: The lawyer of Polanski revokes the delay of persecution
The French-Polonian Chinese avocate Roman Polanski announced once Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), the abandonment of prosecutions against his customer, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for more than 30 years of death.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer of the "Pianist", said before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Second Californian District of serious procedure errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I recall the layout of charges here and now, Mr. Hummel said, before it was said that the behavior of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the ass."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- had been dead since -- had discussed, before he sent his judgment, with a prosecutor who had told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious error of procedure.
This debate was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and wished" (Roman Polanski, searched and wished), from the mouth of David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally said to have "laugh" to the author of the documentary.
If the court would leave the proceedings, Mr. Hummel claimed that he had a sentence, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentary.
The accusation reiterates the argument already developed in the first instance, meaning that no loss of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski would not be presented before the court.
The cineast, age of 76, fled from the United States in 1978, before his sentence was declared, for " illegal sexual relations" with a less than 13 years old.
He never sent the feet to the United States since.
The adjoint of the Country of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski " must be here to be in the audience."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused ones, that it is possible to escape?
For her, the cineast "demands a pleasure to the heart, but disappointing its authority."
One of the three judges -- which now has 90 days to make their decision -- also highlighted that there were other alternatives to flee.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the delay of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the persecution.
Recognizing that her client doesn't support any rebuilding of the case of Polanski, she said: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was just.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest mandate.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to residence in Gstaad's chalet, waiting for an eventual extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, released by the dollar's increase
The New York Bourse ended without Friday, in a market that was spent between the best indicators of the United States and the increase of the dollar: Dow Jones wined 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final numbers of closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is located from 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points, while Nasdaq, dominantly, abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended standard & Poor's 500 progressed from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, raised Mace ́cksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in extreme margins, the exchange volume has become very low and I think that it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic operators than intended, which "aid to improve the market opinion on the solidity of the economic recovery," were summarized by Charles Schwab's analyses.
In the United States, detailed profits increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of decade and much more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers was clearly decreased in December, at .4 against 67.4 in the month, and the preliminary estimation of the University of Michigan.
However, the indications have been released by a new progression of the dollar, at the top of two months before the euro, which "builds the sensitive sectors to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick, from the Deutsche Bank.
The values of the land have thus lost.
The obligatory market has been decreased.
The benefit of the Tresor to 10 years has progressed to 3.540% against 3.482% Thursday evening and the good of 30 years to 4.497% against 4.492% of the watch.

This competition, which is held for the nineth time in South Africa, is directly transferred from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17H00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to restore my corona.
This experience was fascinating.

As last year, the candidates have made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on the wheel, and cut the local kitchen.
With exception, they also met the South African President Jacob Zuma who took their hand.
It's not fitting for a State Chairman, note Miss Sierra Leone.
The most beautiful memory of them will certainly remain the outcome in the Cap (sout-west) for the Football World of June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I often made people that I never thought I could come near.
I'm not sure to come back for World-2010, enthusiasm Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," he assured his son David on Friday at his arrival to the Airport of Los Angeles, where he had to go to his father's head hospitalized for several days.
News are very positive.
It's very strong, it's very good, said to the press David Hallyday at his outcome from the airport that brought him from Paris a little after 1300 locals (21H00 GMT).
The son of the son of the song, who looked arrested, assured that he was going to become "very fast" at the Cedars-Sineai hospital of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for conscious infection in the operation of a hernie discovered on 26 November in Paris.
The song was "placed in artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and able to handle his treatment," the press service indicated.
Johnny Hallyday has already been placed in a coma artificial by the doctors of the Cedars-Sineai Hospital of Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Sunday for a conseffective infection in the operation of a herni on 26 November in Paris.
The song had to be repeated on Thursday Thursday evening due to important lesions resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French school of Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade is schooled, to attend a school spectacle, found a photograph of the AFP.
The chirurgical and traumatological chirurgical leader of Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would come on Monday to Los Angeles with the song.
The manufacturer violated Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurochirurgian who operated the song on 26 November at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The chirurgians in Los Angeles said they were out, said Mr. Camus.
I have heard of a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believed that Johnny Hallyday was "too fast to Los Angeles, with the employment of the Paris chirurgian."
I had this doctor online who assured me that there was no problem for this journey, and it was stupid, since I had two discourse heritage, he said.
No longer on the RTL, he indicated that the song was apparently "part without drain, without anything" after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actor Marie Trintigant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated actor Charlotte Gainsbourg to resume a hematome after a brain hepatitis.
But it is also a doctor for the sulphurous reputation, condemned by justice for several times in medical responsibilities, as well as for tax fraud and scroquery.
Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medicines' order, accused him to be "a man without scrupules" continues "regularly" before the Council of the Order, which is "never to be recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed Friday by his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "profitly deployed" and that post-operatory reviews were "normal".
The operation "is not hemorragic and thus didn't need to put a drain," he said.
In any case, the tournament of the song, whose health injuries have multiplied since this year, is between parentheses.
Of course, a renewal of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as intended, was very short, Mr. Camus said.
The UDF increased the ton and summed the New Centre to not use its seal again
The UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the tentative of the OPA of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former Giscardian party, while he remained using it no longer on any support, on the basis of Judic prosecutions.
Hervé Morin announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, considering that François Bayrou was not worth defending its political inheritance after he had drawn his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is partner of the UNP, had also intended to confirm this Saturday strategy before the National Council of the CN.
To support its approach, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the CN) who returned the property of the UDF mark for the first to submit it in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial property.
But on Thursday evening, the office of the UDF, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou, who do not hear to depose, came out of his silence to lay down a residence to the Minister and to the lawyer, so that they do not use the sign and send them the property of the mark, in the lack of Judicial prosecutions.
You have multiplied, these last days, the statements indicating that you would propose your political movement to +receive+ the UDF signature, write it in a court signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also believed that it was good to follow your military mother and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan +l'UDF of today+, also find the signatures of the core.
As you don't know it, you have no right to use this sign, explains the UDF office that keeps the NC to return "soon the name of the UDF of any support and (so) web site".
He also requested Hervé de Charrette to "send the property of (la) to its right-righteous effects."
If you did not, the courts would be arrested to comply with the law and the rights of the UDF adherents, the signatory shall be predicted.
In their court they indicate that the UDF is a political movement from 1978 and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive move, as others did in 2002, to create the OMP".
The New Centre, therefore, has no right to use the UDF seal (the Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the latest Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 with its access to the MODem for three years and the establishment of a "materal and moral interest" office of the training based by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charrette, he continued the office, "which he put the mark," he was not "the more adherent of the UDF for three years", but the UMP.
It benefits scandally and fraudulently from the depth abssence of the UDF acronym to perform it for its account.
This indelicity is being transformed into criminality, they denied, before ironing the NC strategy: "There is apparent to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worth to make himself a name than trying to get out of the anonimate by fraudulently taking a name which is not right."
Affairs Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for weakness abuse
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billion of the Liliane Bettencourt, he benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenian for a part of her fortune.
The 62-year photograph, known for its star photos, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for weakness abuse, a maximum penalty of three years of prison, and EUR 375.000 income.
This decision means that there will be a process in this case worth a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and girls are deceived by holding the dreams of the Cosmetic Empire L'Oreal.
But the 15th correctional room also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, age of 87, should be conducted by three doctors.
The main heritage and actor of the Oreal has always been subject to such an examination, in any case, under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre park at the request.
Wednesday doctors will have to submit a report before 10 March 2010, in particular if Liliane Bettencourt had been able to be in weakness and in which periods.
I think she's going to be subject to it.
I'm going to talk to her about, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mrs Georges Kieman.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is a good news [...] The expert will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this old woman that we must protect, he said.
Since two years, the unique girl of Liliane Bettencourt has committed persecutions against François-Marie Banier, photographs and artists, that she has been accused of have benefited for years of his mother's weakness for a billion euros, in the form of chicks, life-assurance contracts or master tables.
From her side, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photograph, which she considers as a long-term friend.
While the Court had to examine the receiptability of the action taken by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' claims sometimes turned to the large family packaging Friday.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt stated three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her note, in which she said that she was anxious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the court of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt was, the lawyer, "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifty years.
Francoise, I could never talk to her since she's married."
In its part, the Nanterre parquet recalled that the claimant was not able to act, as far as a judge of the Tutches had made these last days the right to make its request to open a Judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt has full ability to act in justice, she is not protected and has no protector.
Nobody else has to act at his place," said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that it would be stated once the proceedings were made on the receiptability of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the government of the large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will be vanity...
Since more than one decade of years, the attitude of the management of large enterprises aimed at payment, recalls the position of consumers before marketing revolving: it is to make the "values" determined above as it was once, to impose the consumers of the products thought by motor technicians.
By putting the customer in the heart of the company, marketing revolution forwarded the market conquest strategy... even though the authorization trial to impose unconnected products from customers' preference factors regularly comes back!
Demobilization of employees can lead to mortal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the part of a much more general phenomena that touchs the frames.
This demobilization is seriously involved in the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, including the R&D and, more, of economic intellectuality.
In fact, the IU "requires from all interested parties... a proactive approach and a prospective vision" ; it requires the employees a commitment that authorisation management income is totally contrary.
That is why we call for a managing revolution that would be to put the employees in the centre of business concerns at the same title as the customer.
Total use of internal opinion investigations
Internal opinion investigations –as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salaries - will they encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- On the other hand, because I could find that, due to a new situation, any structure finally comes, after a lot of turns, to do priorityly... what she has always done.
- Then, because the mass – one of the pathologies of the power - crosses proportionally the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behavior.
Within large engineers schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviourist theory, recently reactivated by "neurological" states and broadly distributed, by studies and media institutions.
Thus, suggesting that the "levels" (sic) of the commitment of the frames are possible, a recent Ipsos investigation issued in Le Figaro.fr comforts leaders in a mechanism position, unadaptated to the world today.
Enable and measure mobilisation factors
In contrast, the management revolution needed for the good function of modern enterprises is supposed to adopt a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasonable or practice of governance, a conscience: for salariers, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears as a way to perform a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only the studies issued by the Motif Analysis adopt this concept of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they agree with their company based on a pre-determined dox that allows them, through their imagination of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to perform their live projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and re-management of human resources "where".
They thus create a favourable area for the coherent development of a strong and effective economic efficiency.
Oslo talks: The "righteous War" is worth loving right in Obama
The American right welcomed Friday the speech announced in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel price of the peace 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservators, who broadcasted the price allocation to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential talk as Sarah Palin, an ancient candidate to the Presidency during the elections of 2008.
I loved what he said, said Mrs. Palin, the ivory of the right side of the Republican party, to the United States Today daily, with the subject of the war "at times needed" in its memories that come from being held.
The war is well heard of the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop those terrorists all over there, is she deceived?
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his pre-decedent George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, was employed on Thursday in Oslo to justify the charge of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the President had made Oslo "the very good work".
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former president of the House of Representatives, which particularly appreciated the statement of "the existence of evil in the world" in the Presidency proposal.
On some sides, I found this historical talk, said Mr. Gingrich, asking on the radiophone emission "The Takeaway".
The former election, considered by some as a possible candidate to the Republical Investment for the Presidency election of 2012, was pleased to have seen "a "left president" to remind the members of the Nobel Committee "which they would not be free and could not repeat peace prices if there was no force."
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's old pool reverter in Washington Post, Mr. Obama said "a very American speaker".
In addition to presenting himself in the "citoyen of the world" as "He always does it", "he spoke as a American President", reminding the Europeans "they live in a security bull that they have not created and that they do not do much to keep it," Mr. Gerson said.
Among the rare to be not convinced, a faucon of Bush's age, the former ambassador of the United Nations John Bolton, qualified the speech of "terne, ampouled and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
At the left of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the resource to force.
When the war is enhanced in the sense of justice, it is easy to justify the mass of innocents.
However, the pressure of the centre-left remained elegible in the place of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who continued to think that the Nobel was first assigned to Mr Obama, qualified his "superproduction" allocation even for a known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should use a road faith to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," was burned in California's day.
Mr. Obama "proclaimed the talk that it needed," stated the New York Times, the judge "at the same time shadow and building".
Routiers: three marathons for a agreement that saves Christmas supply
At three Marathon negotiations meetings, the syndicates of the road sector and TLF, the only patronal organization to remain until the end, reached on Thursday evening to an agreement that ends the term of greenhouse and threat on Christmas supplies.
At the Friday night signature meeting, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several negotiations sessions, started on Thursday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators were left on Friday morning, with the hope of signing the agreement text quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same if three patronal organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had locked the door.
But more than six hours of a meeting started at 11.00 p.m. so that everyone would be agreed and that the text would be signed at 18.00 p.m.
The conflict " would have been very threatenable for businesses" and "is to be afraid that it had come to disturb the end-year festivals," Mr. Bussereau said.
The text provides an increase in payments of 4% for lowest salaries (in local and regional road transports) and 2.9% for higher (international transports).
In time, for low salaries, " 8.72 euros are spent to 9.06.
It's not great, but we're part of very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Whether we are going to order our soldiers that there are no blocks, no blocks from the centres of ravitalisation.
But we can always have some recalcitants that are not satisfied, he's got.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed the "good agreement", even if it was "difficulty to conceive increases on high salaries accounting for international competition".
It states that increases will be of 170 euros monthly for lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the good sense and respect of the salaries, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said to him "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides revaluation of movement costs of 3% and the general statement of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, allow the question of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective Convention.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that a reduction of 100 million euros of patronal charges was made of a government amendment to the project of rectification funds for 2009, voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same term".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the enterprises associated with this organization, and for a second time, to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Work.
It will be "in the fastest time," Mr. Bussereau assured.
Opposition of patronal organizations can only dump the process.
The FNTR stated a "dupes market" because the 100 million euros have already been promised in the sector to acquire a part of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of Transport has required us to negotiate in the urgence, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to oppose the foods from the next wake up, Unostra deployed.
For the other, the agreement is able to "crease the grave of a very large number of SMEs of the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disturbations this week-end, non-subsidy syndicates of the RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, the largest transport line in the common city of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the second day of the greenth between the RATP syndicates and the direction of the RATP has left them on their hunger as regards their premium request.
Samedi and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10h00 and 20h00, due to a train on two on the central tronction (in the Defense and the National) and a train on four outside the central tronction.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require travelers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallerys, who wait for 200,000 clients every day, enjoyed the fact that "the RATP makes efforts to serve the large magazines".
The RER through western is Paris's agglomeration.
The short RATP tronction of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Valeée.
Wednesday, about a train on two was at the point hours, and almost no rows in hours crossed, as prescribed.
As Thursday, there was no cow on which the French were organized.
So at the small morning, the St. German-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less frequency than usually, especially because of the absent of students and students.
In Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained to have been raised "a 30-hour ago, to be sure to come at the time".
The Saint-Lazare gare did not know of saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had proposed a framework of agents and forces of the order.
The RER A operated by the SNCF in origin or to Cergy-Le-Hauut came or went from the Saint-Lazare gare to join the metros.
New general assemblies of groves will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, "maygres" by the syndicates, of a meeting with the following Wednesday.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, worktime, carrier deployment, etc.
This is not what the leaders want, which claims a due premium, the Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its priority proposals between parentheses, the CGT insisted that the direction "is not able to resolve a problem while it is done with roads and SNCFs".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for " a broader examination of the terms of exercise of professionals", stated the RATP.
What also said to the syndicates that the company was "needing users from the weekend".
On the morning, about 150 leaders had envahied a settlement committee in Paris.
It was the time when the direction, which still had any discussion during the greenhouse, had proposed the meeting "in an appealing concern".
The conflict threatens to expand on Tuesday RER B, after the depth of an advice by Unsa and independents.
Syndicates ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros with 30 different euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and degradate the work conditions on this line to a million travelers daily.
The RER leaders, all in the second part of carriage, affect from 2.200 to 2.700 brute euros and 600 to 650 euros for decaled hours, Sundays and Fridays.
Turkish justice dismissed the pro-curde party, a serious decision of consequences
The Turkey Constitutional Court proposed the dilution of the main procured part of the country on Friday, a decision which immediately followed anger manifestations in the Kurd community, south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision is worth compliance with the Government's task, which has just had the hand to the Kurd community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Partie for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a "home of damageable activities in the State independence and in India's unit", the President of the Court of Hasim Kiliç said to the press at the end of four days of decisions.
The decision was taken at the uniformity of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to proclaim the dissolution, Mr. Kiliç indicated that 37 of the frameworks of the party, including its President Ahmet Turk and Mr. Aysel Tugluk, were banned of political life for a period of five years.
The Court also announced the rescue of the parliamentary immunity benefited by Mr. Turk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasure of the Goods of the Party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders had predicted that the Members would leave the Parliament instead of sitting as a non-label parliamentary.
The decision follows a procedure held in 2007 by the Cassing Court of Justice Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which accuses the DTP to obey the "directives" of the Working Party of Kurdistan (PKK) as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Number of observators believe that DTP is the political vitrine of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, ensures that he has no "organic links" with the PKK but qualifys the terrorist organization and calls the government to negotiate with him.
The Court's conviction intervenes when the Government has just been taking hands to the Kurd community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to take the support of the Kurdes to the PKK and to end the conflict.
The DTP leaders claimed that a dissolution could lead to a recycling of pressures in the south-east anatoly, where many manifestations against PKK Abdullah Öcalan's detention conditions were degenerated in herit with the police in recent weeks.
During the announcement of justice, thousands of manifestants gathered before the DTPs in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east in most of Kurdes.
The forces of the order have drawn lacrymogeneous greys and used water canons, while demonstrants launched molotov cocktails or stones, with branches.
Hundreds of people also appeared in Istanbul.
According to the verdict, Mr. Turk claimed that the decision of the Justice would "progress the disappointment".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (curde, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, he said to the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic Movement, also deployed the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of parties.
This is nothing, said the Ministry of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total democratic opening of the Government, commented on the Ahmet Island Political Analysis.
We can, obviously, wait for a PKK reaction.
Thursday, the PKK repeated an attack that killed seven soldiers three days ago in north of Turkey, one of the most murdered months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a great winter.
But the responsibility for the road dealing and switching service (FES) clearly indicates that it is not for citizens.
It's just so that agents can test the vehicle technology and make them well control.
And according to the meteorologist, that could be well for this week end.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and glass.
The FES follows a very developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that since he denied the city of Francfort and the temperatures descended below zero, large sample vehicles park 20 main roadways (named A) .
This includes large-handed streets, main arteries, such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes pump access, common transport travellers, pitton areas and roads, such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES agents start their service at three hours tomorrow.
If necessary, the 1040 miles of very must be salted with a straight road foundation that reachs well, at 3 hours of maximum time.
That is why the FES service starts at 3 hours of the morning, so that the roads are delayed when the trading of journals begins.
There or it becomes more difficult, it is when the snow begins to fall at 7:30 a.m. morning.
This makes problems, tells us the responsibility for the deflaying and switching of the roads "car no cars are willing to let the sale vehicles go."
Then, if he doesn't sneak, we'll take care of the ways of access and dessert paths - such as the Council-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows well that this always makes a few complaints.
At five hours ago, the FES's pedestrian team is on the road to prioritize the dangerous areas and transitions.
As regards cyclable tracks, FES services are usually unable to take care of it.
Mr. Brauburger states that there is a special service in Francfort to monitor the status of ponts between 22 hours and 4 hours.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salt vehicles are coming after the temperature below 2 degrees.
It also occurs that the police calls this special service in cases of need.
The box of dinosaures
The Tawa Halle looked like other carnivor dinosaures: this bipede measured about 2 metres long for 1,50 metres above, its later members were powerful, its long-term corner was made of accumulated and covered teeth, and his short arms ended by faäille grips and had a long kitchen.
If this species had v ́n a few million years later, it would not have had anything exceptional.
But as the Sertling Nesbitt report of the Texas University in Austin and its clusters in the magazine Science of Thursday, Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaures containing these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made part of the lands of the supercontinent, Pange and was on the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the opening of the Tawa light on a new day the evolution of the first dinosaures.
In fact, he shows us the links of parentality, distribution and characteristics of these last.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt entered fo's company of other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site north of the New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Natural History Museum of Utah and member of the fo's team ra's that sometimes they came to find a twelve-seeds in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary cup from Trias.
Scientists very quickly realized that part of these bones belonged to a new species.
Fo's have updated the rest of five specials.
A discovery that confirms the theories on the beginning of the development of dinosaures.
The researchers baptized him by the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the God of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is a very exceptional discovery: Dinosaur fossils from Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete ox fragments.
All Palestinian experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, however, it makes it possible to confirm certain theories on the beginning of the development of dinosaures.
According to the current state of knowledge, the dinosaures appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, which makes it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaures.
Experts ask themselves at which time Saurians were divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropodes (carnivors) which include the Tyronasaure and Velociraptor appeared later and which descended by birds, sauropodes, squareds in the long corner, and those who appear to them and ornithish herbivors who are part of the species such as triceratops and stegosaurus.
According to S. Nesbitt and its studies, Tawa is one of the first theropodes .
This species presents an interesting report of primary and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found indications that allow to think that the Tawa hallae had small air sacks in its bones at the corner level, as the birds who are the seeds of the theropodes.
These small air pockets facilitate the respiration of birds in relation to mammifers.
It is that at the Tawa Hallae, the vertebraes were also partly filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest theropodes presenting small air sacks in his bones.
As the apparent line of saropodes had also air sacks and a ossature, they could think that their common neighbor had already the benefit of this innovation.
Three follow-up wages to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaures with vi in South America, the researchers concluded that Saurians had appeared there.
Thus, the three major evolution lines were divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world, as is, the enclosure of the lands that formed the supercontinent Pangee.
This is confirmed by the fact that the Paleontologist team also discovered the rest of two other terrorists that are not particularly apparent to him.
The three species cannot descend from a common preacher who would have migrated, leading to researchers.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum of New York and Cooper of the Scientific magazine said that there would have been at least three waves of Property to North America.
Some contradictions have been heard.
Martin Sander, paleontologist to Bonn, says there is a more older species, the silesaur, who lived in the present Poland and belonged to a group apparent to dinosaures.
It seems that it could give a wrong vision because there is a large number of dinosaures fossils in South America that have been preserved while there are almost no other continents.
In contrast, how the dinosaures have become the dominant tetrapodes of the secondary eeu, while they have proved from a relatively rare line of the reptiles, there is still a mystery today.
At the time of Trias, the dinosaures shared their lives with many other reptiles, such as the formers of the current crocodiles and many other Saurians.
At the end of Trias, the dinosaures were divided throughout the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, which appeared to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
However, such success is not external.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There was a massive extinction to which the dinosaures survived in a random way while other reptils would have disappeared.
Or then, the dinosaures were better adapted and thus could eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not external.
150 million years later, the fall of a preferred meteorite expansion of a group of animals who also developed during the Trias and who since then lived in the shadow: it was mammifers.
Vienna's solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatures throughout the world.
There are teachers of the University of Toronto, the University of Cambria, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are course charges from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edimbourg, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Breme.
The evacuation by the Casino police of the University of J.W. Goethe de Francfort makes waves over the whole planet.
278 teachers and teachers of the University of J.W. Goethe, but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant Students of Campus Westend.
In a German and German statement they condamne the intervention of the police, which was declared by the Director Committee of the University.
Last week, the President of the University Werner Mämer-Estler had evacuated the baths occupied by students and teachers as well as walls and works of art had been barbuilled by graphfitis.
Five students were hurt during evacuation.
Signers believe that degradations did not justify "a so violent intervention from the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "inacceptable attainment" to the freedom of research and education.
The fact of focusing attention on vandalism acts is only to "delegite and criminalize protest" and try to forget the reasons for mobilization.
The University Committee, however, underlined the debates that would be essential.
The course loads require that the committed criminal persecution be immediately suspended.
Most employees did not participate in degradations.
Legitimation of protests
Youths of the Green Syndicat of the Services Sector and the German Syndicates Conference (DGB) are solid to students.
Protections are only the expression of a growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary for youths of the Syndicat Verdi.
As regards the Ministry of Sciences of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , it took and caused the action committed by the President of the University and Police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any employment and degradation of places is completely unacceptable, said to the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the current television emission.
We understand the sense of protests but we do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
Parliamentary groups of SPD opposition, Verts and Left (Left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of some walls penetrate to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of La Left (Li日)
Instead of considering the arguments and revendications of students, they are evacuated.
The Party La Gauche presented an invitation to the Ministry of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
During a long time, it was the secret city reputation, prohibited to visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscou, was, under the Soviet regime, a local research of the secret army under strict monitoring.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants at 37 km from the centre of Moscou, the community has the reputation to be the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nanoelectronic production and research sites are implanted there.
Since September 2008, Zelenograd's representatives made connections with Riedberg, instead of French sciences – with university institutions and the company of the Francfort Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal and last Thursday meetings of the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg held a " Strategy Protocol".
The signators were the Master of Moscou Juri Rosljak and the preacher Anatolyjimov of Zelenograd for the Russian Delegation, Edwin Schwarz, project section head for Francfort.
In 2010, the representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, with the strong point of scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow the FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
In contrast, Russian scientists wish to contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutions and companies.
There is the Moscou Electrotechnic Institute, the large Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Electronica firms.
The community was founded in 1958 as "planed socialist city" for arming research.
Zelenograd (literal translation “Green City”) draws his name to the rubbers in the hearts of which the research centres are implanted.
Project S21: a fee for Stuttgart
The width of the Stuttgart 21. project is not sufficiently high.
For its partners it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If we want to. S21, it is much more than the promotion of a railway gar, more than a colossal building project that will blow the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a desperate chaos of songs for a decade of years.
Stuttgart 21 was born by the spirit of the 1980s.
The line head gars, with roads that ended in the town, had the reputation at the time of being the rest of the transport technology of the 19th century, which made a frein sabot of the modern railway traffic, because it had to make a lot of time to pass the lomotives back to the front.
It's what it's to do, short stop, go away – that's what you need to do.
That's why line heads must disappear: in Francfort and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train travel garage, which is about half-way on the Trans-European Travel Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "Europe's clergy".
The implementation of the S21 project will really be started, although the visions of the 1980s have not been longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to enhance the garage in the respective capitals of Hesse and Baverière, was exorbitant.
In fact, line heading gars do not actually have input and outcome problems since there are modern trains, reversible with authors and pilot cars at the two extremities.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now launched by the new trace of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have taken it.
The iron road company is part of it, because it is the contribuable costs of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the company.
From urbanistic view, this project is relatively well justified.
There is a city space that – if we believe the graphics of the planners generated by the fabriker – will be very green.
For the railway transport system, S21 is weak.
The transition garage and the extension of the section are designed for a trafficking of people - and it is typical in the 1980s - a huge growth.
At that time, there was no competition for good flights yet.
Modern trade policy should be focused on the strengthening of the trade of goods because rail transport is much more respectful than by carrier on the road.
But the new track, with its inclinations, doesn't match goods trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious about indirectly many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be included in the Suabe project.
It's the official number.
Experts think that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure that in the next decade, this silver will miss for other points of joinment and engrossment in the network.
The list of Transport Ministers refers to all sixty large projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhin valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987, this line has been built in the railenti.
It would really be urgent to press up here on the champion.
But the S21 project makes the effect of a frinage sabot.
The inheritance of the Rhin valley is in the way to become the outcome goulot of the trade of international goods, and this is in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the sentence on airport
In the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the Land expressed the possibility of calling for the Court of Hesse on the prohibition of aircraft at night.
The Ministry of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had charged experts to review the judgment made by the Court of Justice and which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel had justified in a written document that the country should adjust the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the project for the construction of the northwest airport of Francfort.
It is not compatible with the protective protection of citizens against night aircraft.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wants to make a case against the sentence.
The critical opposition of this time and tries to press the representative of the Government so that the situation may be forward to the Federal Court of Justice of Leipzig.
The Chairman of the SPD SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before elections, which consisted of prohibiting night flights. Otherwise, it will be conditioned as a total lack of a given word.
It is very difficult to be authorised to keep his word, said the leader of the Verts Tarek Al-Wazir by allocating the electoral slogan of the FDP "We have our promises."
Minister Dieter Posch refuses Schäfer-Gümbel's reproachs, which predicts that the Government of the country is trying to work at even the night flights by using "advocacy and robberdise".
We need time to make a specific legal examination.
Coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Mämer (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely broken.
American banks refund the allocated aid
The large American banks, very touched by the crisis, are declined from their links to the State.
The Bank of America announced Thursday that it had completely recovered $45 billion ( more than $30 billion), which corresponded to the aid granted under the Tarp Saving Plan.
The American CNBC television chain reported that Citigroup also intended to restore the aid received.
Institutions thus seek to dismiss imposed restrictions, which comply with the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonus attributed to the managers and the higher cost regulation.
The Bank of America has launched an increase in capital by the sale of credits to investors who reported to him $19 billion.
The rest of the sum is from the bank's boxes which are well filled with the sale of several other sectors.
Wednesday last night, Kenneth Lewis, the General Bank of America, had expressly made thanks to the American contributors: the injection of capitals has been considered as helpful to overcome a difficult period.
The institution had assumed its capacity by buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank to the strongest financial tourment.
Citigroup also intends to gain money on financial markets to be free from the State's tutorial.
The American bank could thus launch a 20 billion capital increase on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain quoting the environmental environments.
Citigroup's portfolio did not want to comment on this information.
In June, the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley refunded the public funds they had benefited.
Accelerated selection
Finally, everything happened even faster than planned.
During two weeks after the removing of the current act holding the head of Nikolaus Brender's office by the ZDF German Chain Administration Council, the following is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night for the nomination.
Peter Frey who managed ZDF's Berlinish editing was the great favor.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order to not predict the procedure.
However, there was also the will that the ZDF Markus Schächter would not be accepted by the Administrative Council.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needed a vote of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known in the closure of the editing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Administrative Council to extend the Nicolaus Brender contract for five years but it was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council were declared favorable to the re-dumping of Brender and 7 others had voted against.
In fact, the CDU, which is majority in the Administrative Council, had already allowed to hear several weeks before the vote, would not want to re-due Brender to its post.
It is Roland Koch, the President of the Hesse Land, who has organized a liaison against the head editor.
He had concluded that the contract of the very estimated editor would be extended by invoking the fact that the ZDF information emissions had been decreased under Brender.
That is why protests have yet occurred, almost until the vote, enhanced the growing political influence on the ZDF.
Finally, there were even 35 public law experts who were involved in the debate and who estimated the way Koch's action was anticonstitutional.
But that wouldn't be done to anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 to 1957 in Bingen.
He studied the political sciences, the pedagogy and the Roman languages (spanish).
He then worked in the Southwest (Rhenanie-Palatinat radio body) and Frankfurter ́dschau (German national portrait quota).
In 1983, he becomes an editor in the ZDF all over the "day-day" magazine.
Then his parkers continued: from 1988 to 1990, he was the assistant of the main editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was the leader and representative of the "Morgenmagazins" (a bimensual information issue submitted by the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the external policy service of the ZDF and the Berlinish editor.
After Brender's disgrace, while he was just elected by the specialized Medium Magazin magazine, the Verts announced that they would have a constitutional complaint
Koch's opposer to the Administrative Council, the President of the Renania-Palatinat Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the proposals for the staff of the Intensity cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
Beck, however, does not intend to ask for the delay of the political personalities of the ZDF Monitoring Committees.
Peter Frey, the follower of Brender, had deeply acted with the Administrative Council by criticizing the committee in its decision to limogger Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalist independence, Schätter was able to propose it for the post of the head-up editor without losing the face, as the Administrative Council could eliminate it without being susceptible to put a political party on the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classed liberal left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of education, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs decide to be more consistent: at meeting between the Ministers and the Delegates of the Rector Conference, an agreement was established that the work conditions of Bachelor or Master of Property are improved.
In the future, students should be able to end their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the tests: a single examination must allow closing the selected study module.
Moreover, the labour charge should be reviewed to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher educational institutions want to easily easily evaluate the exam between universities and foreign.
Otherwise, the countries have been committed to organize more flexible common requirements for Bachelor and Master's branches.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one country to another.
Lower Extensions
Since the beginning of the student protests in June last, the Ministers of Education and University Directors have no longer expressed the "studiability" mode.
But for the first time, this expression → takes a specific meaning.
The Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of certain examens: "Each module must normally be able to be concluded by a single review," can be read in a document of a thirty pages on the future conditions of adoption to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Council, says that by decreasing clearly the charge of the examinations, it should be able to stop discoveries, which would have been deceived of studyability.
"Studiability" should be overwhelmed in the future as the critical criteria of the study organization.
The modules as the background must be examined carefully to see if it is not possible to avoid the feeling of disturbance that sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hambourg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge of Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is deliberated.
Students should " have the possibility and margin of management necessary to enable and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will concern access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "recreditations" every 5 years, which is, however, only in 2015, all cycles will be examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies on the Federal Territory which depart from the Accreditation Council created by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exercised a certain pressure on the countries so that they would be on the agencies so that the programmes would not be too loaded and the system of reviews was not too strict.
In some countries, universities and higher specialised schools have already been heard with their regional ministers to take appropriate measures.
Renania-Palatinat is still the only country who has granted its agreement to provide more means for the development of the Bologne process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorielset programmes to strengthen pedagogical orientation offices and review offices and international relations
The countries and universities provide for this a budget of 10 million euros.
In the beginning of 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament a amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
Following this, it will be necessary to pass only one examination to clore its studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible, and it must also be able to ensure the ability of notes from other higher educational institutions and the access to Master should be simplified.
From the end of the next year, the "studiability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and opposition again discussed the issue of studies in the country.
The decisions have been appreciated, but critics have been heard.
The Federal Chairman of the Union of Socialists said that he would wish that the organization of educational policies would not pass in the future "of the closed gates" of the Ministers and University Directors.
At the latest after educational greenhouse, students should be able to express a little.
The future diplomates from higher education are supported by the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Directors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful" said on Thursday at meeting with the Ministers of Education of the countries with which HRK works on a common reform project.
For the Syndicat of Education and Science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn are not quite far. He claims the right and possibility for each diplomatic Bachelor to enter into a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller member of the GEW Director committee requests the countries to ensure today's Bachelor students that there will be sufficient places tomorrow for study in Master and as well as possible.
As a result, the countries need to have more course loads.
Instead, the Ministers of Education did not describe the possibility of attaching access to Master.
More than one page-based note on Herta Mämer
This is by the words “Aria in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...” that begins a work of the poet Werner Sünner, in which he thematicizes in the bribes of trooping phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who wined freedom but lost its language territory at the same time.
Werner Sünner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was a teacher of German and Ââi in Bucarest, and then a collection director in a house of edition for youth before installing in Francfort on the face.
Sõner received various literary prices; in 1993 he held the very convoided poesi chair of the University of Goethe de Francfort and since 2002 he was director of the Hesse literature forum at Mousonturm artist's house in Francfort.
He made many talks about him in the last Monday non literary circles, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "The German Literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror deforming your dossiers Security".
Visiblely destabilised and deceived, Sõner made a statement in which he recognised before his German-Roman writers like Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had made as an informant for the Security Policy.
Sõner received the price of Germany together with some of the participants in 1989.
The insult tests had started insidiously in 1971.
I am, concluded Sünner, "as so someone who doesn't have enough knowledge of resisting the intimidation of security."
The Werner Sünner Poet is the Walter informationer (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honouration of the Nobel price for Herta M日er and its exemplary literary demonstrations with the mechanisms of the dictature power, the literary scene is spread and, in particular, the community of German authors originating in Romania, in a case that shows the objects and the lowness of a political system based on police monitoring and spiralisation.
Werner Sõner is, as we can say according to the current knowledge, not only culpable but also victim.
In his own Safety dossier, IM Walter played a role, assured the specialist of the literature Michael Markel after Sõner's confession, and he returned to the positive influence of IM Walter who had been prohibited in his favor.
"He could have taken it out of all difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt moral need to do this comment.
The form in which Sõner made his statement and before this public was unexpected, however, having an ancient dissident of his employment with Roman secret services is not really so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reservation for the security spheres had already written Herta M©er in July in the "Die Time" magazine after reading the 914 pages of its own document.
It may be that victims would have made speculations and sometimes they would have deceived what real names had been hidden last by the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast with Germany, where the consultation of Stasi's dossiers is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the security dossiers is still very confused.
A systematic lighting has been unexpected and released in the past years.
Only in 1999, a national advice corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work in the Simulation of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of the documents has been carried out since.
Since 2005, there is a law which defines the management of archives.
The influence of ancient members of the Security in Romania remains very large, is confirmed by the interview of an elder responsible for the Security of Temevar who, after announcement of the release of the Nobel price to Herta Mämer, expressed three-deparently in respect of the laurate.
She had a psychosis, and we finally asked her only one time.
The infamy of the power thought to be able to express himself here, without any gene, under the cover of the freedom of expression.
Certainly, many ineluctable issues are associated with the case Sünner how this occurs so often in a hidden context of fault.
Why now? Who has been spoliated? The weighted reaction of the auditors, with Sõner, is expecting that the follow of this chapter will be defined more by a seat to know than by an injury and a feeling of shame.
On the Genesis of Herta Mämer's work, who received the Nobel price yesterday, it is more than a note below.
Tumultes at the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative arrived there, cut to four e âles coming from a celebration of Sympa, on which the manufacturer of sport articles had extended its goods when the new VFB Christian Gross traveler went down at halfnight at a Mercedes C class, which he just came to call, an oral plastic sack of the supplier's hand.
The man, whose cow crown was attached to the attention, left to drive into the city that was still alien to him.
Otherwise, our fifth-year could have taken himself the flighter – he hadn't drunk alcohol and he wasn't even drunk of happiness.
He had passed a pleasant evening but tomorrow we had to take the job again.
Because it's now that it's going to start.
The words of the Switzerland that we had been committed three days before were: "We have reached the eighth end," that is, in the ligue of champions through our 3:1 against the Urziceni Union of Romania," but we should not let us go through success. This will be a brutal fight to not return."
The "great work" waits for us on Sunday.
There it is to repeat the results of the campions ligue at daily.
And the weaknesses that have reached the surface after the three sending targets of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.) will be overcome.
Outturn tirage
The eighth end of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 Fev日/ match return 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be removed to Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the fulminant income of Babbel's follower was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not modered only with the one who had been able to have a chance, who had transmitted to Stuttgart's destabilised professionals, an unfortunate motivation and a pleasure to play.
I was seeing the players, and I told them that they were to be on their holidays, I advised them to be more courageous, explaining the "Plombing of Âs" – Gross - the receipt of success that sounded so well that did not do any more effects with Mr. Babbel.
He started a certain magic, acknowledged Jens Lehmann - Babbel partisan - "in the foot when there is a new impulse, it happens sometimes things that we would never have believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of breaking for hurt, went in front of the best player through its dynamism, tried to describe the "fenoway" found by a "fresh wind" proverb and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who passes to the action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the present situation."
But it seems that Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not passed the head yet, keeping the Horst Heldt manager
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart has especially needed tenacity.
Like Gross, players and the manager are able to overevaluate the victory against a totally exceeded defence and affliction of Roman invitations.
They also won in Glasgow before they had four days later a bad reveal in Leverkusen with 0:4 , objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had a well achieved one of the objectives of the season, but that there were others who were still far.
We haven't passed the hard head yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th anniversary did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory for three months, is from the events of the weekend that a television interview of Jens Lehmann's target guard made rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take, not Jens, against Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acerb criticism.
He had accused the weakness direction and said she had decided to change a trainer under the pressure of public fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the matches was deleted to him.
Lehmann's statements were “marked by a pure selfishness ” and announced the consequences of the target guard.
They were not able to become friends for the life of these two quarters.
In all cases, they agreed for all the rest, which is that without the preliminary work of the group by the replaced entrepreneur, the high sport and fighting representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a large part in success ” retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chariot – and even the man in plastic sack bought.
World Championship Hard Weights
Hard fight in Berne: Kevin Johnson's challenge caused the world's campaign of Vitali Klitschko without delay.
But after twelve difficult rounds, Ukraine defends its campion title of the world's weight of weight according to the WBC Federation version.
In the unity of the judges, he has been committed to the points.
Hambourg – Vitali Klitschko keeps his campion title in the world of weights.
The WBC Federation announced that in Saturday night, the 38-year-old campion had gained a victory at the points of unminded judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honesty since his return on the scene in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine has already received the WBO and WBC campaign title.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed the KO so waited.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, has accepted his deficiency for two times because of hurt.
The challenger Johnson has to accept his first deficit in the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arrène, before 17,000 spectators, the Great Klitschko was especially wanted to say the battle, from the top of its 2,02 metres, by its left.
Johnson, of the 11 smaller metres who, before the duel, announced the end of the Early Klitschko, succeeded to avoid the campions, thus preventing Klitschko to make his play against the damageous right.
Johnson, too much in action for a challenge, was especially trying to cross the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and in gestures, only very rarely reached the champion.
He is even the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, who has overcome the distance of the 12 rounds with Klitschko.
The challenge had made a lot of voice in the capital of Switzerland before fighting.
He insulted Klitschko the traitor of "Zombie villain" which "is not really able".
Pens the Friday weight, the champion couldn't stop provoking Johnson by making him falling his nose sunlights "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory from Klitschko's comback.
Klitschko repeated during its fourth fight since its comeback on 11 October 2008
After a pause of almost four years, he had held the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "sa" WBC ceinture that he had previously left without war.
This year, he defended his champion title, rejected the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm perfect," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is trying to meet the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a campaign of WBO and IBF Federations.
But this is the British David Haye who, destronging the big Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, brings the WBA cinture.
This year, Haye had canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko that had to be done in September.
It would be that his promotion society intended to play this match at Wembley stage in London.
The case Kunduz
The frontal attack of the opposition: the Chairman of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense of Guttenberg of lies in the case of Affairs Kunduz.
SPD and La Left (Left) parties ask for the possibility of explaining.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposite rejected the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) that some facts had been disclosed.
The Minister intentionally "formed a controversy" on the murder of two citernal trucks last September, said the Chairman of the Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the issue of information from the ARD "Tagesschau" chain.
In §, that means he's lying.
The order to kill was given to the total degree of the rules of the International Security Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in principle, the content of the NATO report and which was read by Mr. Gutttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Wednesday, new media revelations, the lapped goal was actually, not to destroy the furnished trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO request report, 142 persons were killed or hurt in the American air attack that had been subject to the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Verts, the SPD and the Left prayed to Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak in the shortest time before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the accident.
Jürgen Trittin and its part of the Verts Renate Künast are noticed that Ms. Angela Merkel must be aware if the target massing strategy is part of the Afghanistan Federal Government Policy if the chancelery, army and information services have approved this new strategy.
The portfolio of the Government rejects these criticisms.
The chancer had no influence on the interventions of the army in Afghanistan, he said.
Samedi, votes were stronger to express doubts about the facts of general inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert, as was presented by the Minister.
According to the SPIEGEL Journal, the information they had sent to Guttenberg on the attack of cyber trucks were correctly and complete.
Officially, they would have discontinued the existence of the NATO report and hidden to the Minister some generous details.
In the area of the two high officers, however, they have informed the Defence Minister of the existence of several reports, including two pages of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Generaler Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested in a court a clearing of facts.
Until now, it has not received a response
Samedi, the Ministry did not want to comment on these observations and sent to the Federal Parliament's Question Committee, which would be the next Thursday to bring the light on the matters.
The Worlds of the Dream
Some see, all wake up, pictures and hear voices that nobody else sees or sees.
There is only psychical diseases, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenoways appear during sleep, everything is very good.
When we are all around in our ashamed rooms, we can be able to see us without attractive to dreams and most foolish fantasies.
However, who, wake up, makes the experience of dreaming, hears and sees things that others do not understand, has quickly the reputation in our West world to be foolish or druged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices appear only in psychical diseases or under the effect of drugs.
This is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to build houses, pick tables or write romans, but sometimes incites the limits between dream, foolishness and reality to wear.
A conscious awake status, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most different forms, in the best cases it is called visions, the worst of the foolish.
But even if the decliner and the effect distinguish, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Carlos Castaneda prophet, the second states of the calls, psychosis and hallucinations are imputable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delires when the balance, neurotransmetric substances of the brain - in the first place dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonine and achetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complicated hallucinations and delivering thoughts are very often shown during a shizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly attraction force has no power on the person anymore.
Since the antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always thought about the relationship between foolish and dream.
For Aristote, the hallucinations were a form of a wakeless dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, founded in 1861 "a great similarity between foolish and dream," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, imaginations, deliures and illusions that compose it".
We're in April 2001 when Henning T's transformed into personality of a drawn band.
His body is in two dimensions of creared colors.
The earthly attraction has no power on him, it plans at the race of the floor.
He feels a moment.
After him, the devil's creation of ailed, grimbling, the mouth insufficient, showing the teeth.
They follow him, give him foot-cooks with heavy flamboying bottles, cast him against the walls, feeling pains in the whole body.
Tonitrous voices, wicked, wounding, out of walls and radio.
He can't support those voices that insult him and humble him.
Henning T. draws two caves from his stereo chain, actually a bowling and an attachment to a crochet fixed on the floor.
He goes up on a battle and goes through the bowl around the cow.
He's running.
The bullet's disappointed.
Let it use you a lesson, cry the voices in a shooting to throw him the temper. "Go to a clinic and care!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has 6 water psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of about 20 years.
It was started by the LSD.
It also is maniaco-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenie.
He learned to live with his disease, he was married for three years.
Psychosis I have anxious fear and deep discouragement.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
A percentage of the population suffers at least once in his life of schizophrenie; in psychiatric clinics, it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenie, the persons concerned can no longer distinguish between the internal and the outer world, they are in a higher excitation state, which makes it possible to suffer hallucinations, megalomanie, relative foolishness or perseveration.
It is very hard to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not even rare.
The person concerned can no longer make the distinction between the importance and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is disappointed under feelings.
Like the dream, the psychosis opens the clusters to a mary of ideas and fantasies from the deepest beds of the conscience.
The perception of the reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Psychiatries Department of CHU de Heidelberg (Generale Psychiatrie in Universityklinikum).
The skizophrene is in the full centre of the situation, with a meaning that it is focused on it.
At the same time, he finds himself in an efficient role, it is like in a dream, overmonted by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why shizophrenes often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, to wake up is excluded.
Make experience once in his life of hallucination.
In the difference of the dream, Fuchs, "the sensoral and spatial structure of the reality that is invented during the psychosis is conservated."
Delirative thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alignment of v ́ is in a real framework.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabrioles is always an enemy for researchers.
Exemptional situations can lead everyone to lose the perception of reality, Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There is a genetic provision for schizophrenie, but studies on jumbos showed that genes are not the only determinant factors.
The researchers assume that the persons concerned have infidel cerebral lesions.
It is suggested that the neurological maturation of the brain is disturbed at a previous stage of development, for example, by a viral infection of the mother during the gravity, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way the anomalie of the neuronal system occurs and increases the fact that it does not appear for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatising experience may be a psychosis delayer, however.
Similarly, hallucinogene drugs can cause psychosis because they act on neurotransmittors.
When our brain is chauffing.
What's foolish, the professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take honourable medicines to defeat them, while others buy strong drugs to gain them.
The pleasant or disappointable perception of illusions is often just a question of view.
Kasten racial has been reported for ten years on the hallucinations and the phenomena of illusional images: last year he has performed his results in a book titled "The Irreal World in our head".
The hallucinations are part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses, but also of a impressive number of many other pathology.
These are included in mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also Propertyine, epilepsy, sclerose in places, Alzheimer disease or croatian traumatism.
It is surprising to be found that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, which are Kasten, consist of memory fragments that are normally inhibed.
They take the form when brain areas that treat sensoral perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refreshed; when our brain is heavy but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can delay this status as a brain lesion or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, loving threats or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of the participants recognises that at least once in his life the experience of hallucination has been made.
In 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lived in a small town of Mecklembourg-Pomerania and went to school.
A young girl's going to make it normal to say true.
If there were no images and voices.
Pene of the recreation, there is only a young boy, liar, to the long hair of the cattle, addresses him the word.
When she answers her friends looking at her, she's surprised – nobody else sees or does not hold this boy.
They think this tired girl is a lunatic dream but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's wake up, hear and see this boy as she sees and hears the girl sitting near her on the face.
She can even understand her presence at the moment.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young sympathic.
Do I be foolish? She asks you sometimes.
But she knows well that this young and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
The night the appearances are generally scared.
Often visions are hard.
When she is in class, she is not able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new → in her eyes and ears while it is inequality for others and that the teacher is actually explaining equations in the table.
The night the appearances are generally scared.
When, in the darkness of her room, she expects the sleep that comes too rare and too late, she can not often make the distinction if she is wake up or dream already, if the images she sees, the wrathful faces or the girl with bloody details on her arms and the feet are in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me quiet, she's crying to those creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, but they would take her for a fool.
Automne 2009. Sarah K. was today 20 years old.
She had her last year and lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has come into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well she's not foolish.
Fornication is also a work of unexpectedness.
When someone is socially isolated or doesn't have enough stimulations, the probability is that he has hallucinations at the end of a certain time.
I guess the brain is not busy enough, so that there is an animation.
Sarah K., a single girl, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
His hallucinations like when she learned at 13 years of age, that the man she called Dad, since she was old to think, was not her true father.
These are the same cerebral areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real sounds, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," Kasten "is in the brain, the reality is from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, so they are so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy persons do not distinguish from water psychoses.
In contrast, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasms are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to love hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our world, we have a rapid trend to take the imaginary experiences for pathology, Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and doctor of the psychiatric and psychotherapie of the hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something of positive, creator - foolishness is an art work of desperateness.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience diet irosteroide, a particular form of the change of consciousness wake up by dream.
Oneroid v·s are very complex dreams that are considered real by the one who lives them and that it cannot distinguish from the dream even when it is in the state of awake.
The status of oneroid consciousness is manifested during a traumatism or in extreme pathology situations such as patients with polyradiculopathie who are fully conscious, brings experience of a motor paralyzation.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and the world, due to a complete and sustainable incapacity of moving, he replaces this real situation that brings to his life, his own imaginary world that is divorced from reality.
It's a mental limit state between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change is happening but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an inevitable situation, an organizational capacity that is given to us, men, to not shame in the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, a historic of art, also describes his unirroid experiences in his book "Heart Changing" as an action of salvation.
He has 49 years when his conscience is part of a traveling several days after the operation of a cardiac valve follows a transplantation; during that time, his body is condemned to remain inmobile in reanimation.
In a world he created from all parts, visiting foreign places, traveling in time . He sees himself in an old man stuck in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his head watching his health.
He lives in the middle of age among the nobles that produce blood-based stomachs.
It is removed by a Greek moto that leads him into his country, surfaces with his hospital bed in the neighborhood of the Alpes and meets a Korean mafio.
He absortes completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to these internal travels, they are different from any dream.
The dream is a very different state, he writes by describing what he has.
Rather than dreams, memories from mental travel are very clear and very detailed for years later.
It can even be said that they are much more different and more intensive than the real v.
The intensity of this v ́ makes the horizon of our other daily experiences, the psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneroid deliries, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of the outer reality are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten summarizes "can cause a deformation of what we call reality."
A experience that can also be very enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years, children will follow the edition house.
The nomination of Kallen at the PDG of Burda Editions is an intermediate solution: at the longer time, Hubert Burda wants her two children to represent the press group, said Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100% of a family business.
Hambourg - In long term, the editor Hubert Burda sees his company between his children's hands
The two children will be inherited at 27 years and are closely decided to integrate the company, said Hubert Burda, 69, in Spiegel.
All the details have been advanced.
The question to know if they will be active in the company will then be questioned.
It will also be necessary to see if they can.
It is not possible to impose her children to 7500 students without knowing whether they have the ability to take care of it.
This would demorate children as well as the company.
Burda had told the last Thursday that he would leave from the chairman-General since January and that his follower was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, is member of the Administrative Council since 1999.
He was very responsibility for the sector.
Then he cared about the Trésor sector is that he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhaver's department, he also took the head of marketing, foreign, printing and funding.
So for the first time, this is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years ago, was dead a few years ago.
Kallen's name also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda indicates that holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in the families that have been released by a capital boolean, which have made great unfortunate speculations thinking that they could still be griping up.
That has never been my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, said Burda.
I am not absolutely in the role of the country's preceptor as it could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of such international links like the Time, these companies have taken too much importance.

Endsa and Barcelona, get out of the electric car
The Endsa Electronic Company, in relation to the Barcelone Ajuntament, created the "Live Office".
It is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Offina LIVE" (Logistic for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road fee for the implanting of the electric car in the city and will place agreements on mobility, by performing steps, coordinating, presenting subventions, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and the work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to start what will be the future transport.
3 “Electric towns ”
But Barcelone is not the only city that will be involved in the planting of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joined to the project.
It is three cities selected by the Government in the framework of the MOVELE Plan to launch the engineering of the electric car.
The Endsa Electronic Company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generality of Catalogue.
It aims to promote research and development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalogue.
These recent activities are linked to energy, in particular to energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endsa participates in the promotion of electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups at the European scale and has been engaging in additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or Verde CENIT.
Zapatero interviews “a future of peace” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, involves “a future of quietness” for the Spanish car industry, which, as mentioned, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Government's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero reminded the measures made by the exemption during the year to support the car sector.
"Unless the Car Sector Competitiveness Plan, we would have today a landing, closing some of our main production sites," stated the Government President.
"By this plan and by the decision of the marks to remain in Spain in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he said.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Car Sector Plan (PIA), has dedicated 800 million euros to 19 manufacturers and 137 assisting companies, which have mobilised a investment of more than 3.000 million euros.
The leader of the ex-effective explained that this investment was also intended to develop new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on the governmental support measures for the application, in the 2000E Plan, in collaboration with autonomous communities and car companies.
According to the President, this plan was allowed to reduce 6% of the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market and contributed to a "ground increase" of the immatriculations, which progressed from "40 %" in November.
20 000 m2 collection cars
Madrid receives the first edition of the International Collection Cars, a meeting space for professionals and the passionates of the engine world.

Equipment tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also take place on a surrounding circuit outside the exhibitions park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports mind
Mazda hears to prove that the sports spirit is not corrupt with the respect of the environment.
In this regard, it has simply integrated the engine stoping and starting system, i-Stop baptized, a device that at least for instinct is available only on motor 2.0 to 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note that it has received in her own.
Details, the end of the vehicle, habitability, behavior, mechanism, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are notable on the new Mazda3.
By starting with the leading post, it appears that the seats forward have an excellent etnomy and fixation.
The touching of the flight is also especially pleasant.
Continuing with the enemy formed by the control and console table, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a future internal design, with many buttons and commands, as well as living colors in red and blue.
This reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that as well as Mazda3 as the Civic, both Japanese, contrasts with the sovereignty of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, that everyone wants to overcome.
Continuing with the habit, this compact Japanese car presents more habitual than sufficient to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is a big coffre to regular forms.
The engine's automatic stop and starting system, at least for instant, is available only on the engine of two litres and 150 horses and with the manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. He is illustrated by his finance, his lower voice, his performance and its control of his consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with essential engine, both for its great speed and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the selected model for the test is the Sportive, otherwise the one that presents the largest number of series elements.
Among the series equipment, the assistant for road change (RVM) who removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensible internal looker, the board computer on a large size, the stationing captains, the independent climate, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, and the 17 puzzzle alignment wheels, are particularly notable.
Moreover, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Pack Premium Pack which, for $1.500 more, includes between elements of bi-xenon adaptable phars and a BOSE audio system with disk loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of materials used, by its behavior and by its high level of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not perform a lot of kilometres per year will be able to operate for the i-Stop version associated only with the engine of  essence 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for Luxury and 23 270 euros for the tested model, Sportive.
In contrast to this important sum, Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
“ First ” of Luxe
L.A. covers the red cart of sinkness incarned by Penelope, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
Stars have us more than ever blown, both elegant and sexy model clothes for Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", sophisticated as well as habitually, had chosen for a shadow "lady".
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at its electronic core, without providing the possibility of seeing some types of shares or navigating on the Internet.
He benefited from his five minutes of glory in the United States, when the Time magazine designed it as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him in the street, but the interesting idea, especially for young people.
In contrast to the artphones, Peek offers a very low monthly abonnement and price, or less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone's abonnement.
In account of its success, the company launched two new devices: one design for Twitter, the other with a free life data service for six times more dear than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday in the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's even limited as his grandparent American brother, but it's a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with an artphone already know what is the fact of refusing data when a frontier is passed or seeking a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his court.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredible and it has long been to work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but in my respect, I would have had to have made a tess to understand them and good lunettes to read small characters.
Repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose awardable roaming tariff throughout Europe have had a painful effect.
Outside of its country of origin, we are refused to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (is still interesting that he is called Fon while he does not have the Wifi) offers this type of tariff, means that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals that allow them to renew their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No signature and no gallery.
It is a connected device and it is paid at its purchase, not every month.
And this is what I hope to see a day for FonPeek: an option for buying with life access as Peek already proposes to the United States.
Not that I see buy it.
I'm looking at my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more simple formula for consumer.
It would be interesting in seeing a trainer presenting the same system.
The preferred color of Michelle
The yellow is certainly the preferred color of the first lady of the United States.
If she came to Barack Obama's function at the presidential of the United States with a robe and a mantle of this color, she actually chose the same to join it at the second time, without doubt, the most important of her life: the release to Oslo of the Nobel price of the Paix.
Michelle Obama had a very similar model in these two occasions: besides their similar color, a yellow drawing to green with reflections, both times, the table was consistent of three pieces: the robe, the clothes and the clothing, in the same tissue, and was urnished by a large broady or a cup.
While from the first time, he would like the first lady of the United States to follow the sillage of the Princess of the Ashurgas and decided to repeat the same detentions.
But the tissue in which the two incenses are measured make them very different.
If for the use of function it was a spacious dance, however, it would have brought a printed spectacle to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green glasses for the first occasion, and a similar, but sweet model this time.
She also changed the coffee: Hairs are now raised while she was leaving them once.
75% of the working mothers have experienced professional problems due to their maternity
Labour discrimination has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
That is what the study shows "Fecondity and care of women in Spain", conducted by the CSIC in relation to the Women's Institute.
The investigation, conducted by 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years, does not be sure: 75% of the mothers who worked have seen their professional career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences on the start of life in couples and the number of children, whether women work or not and the type of employment.
Those who do not have any activities outside the house, work partly or have a little stable work, get to a couple early, have their first gravity before and have more children.
In contrast, women who have a stable employment, mainly in the public sector, repeat the income in marriage and the first pregnancy, and have less children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of a fixed work have their first child, average 3,7 years after they have been installed in couples. This number exceeds 4,1 for those working in the public sector. "These data show that women who have a stable job needed more time in their life for their life, which led them to revoke the union and the array of children.
Moreover, the type of employment that has been exercised is largely influenced by maternity, but less than the date of common life beginning," explains the CSIC Margarita Delgado researcher.
The level of study is another factor that increases the age of women and their first child's marriage.
According to the question, more training levels are higher, more they marry and have their first child later.
Differences are also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of 35 to 49 years, those who have made elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time 25.1 to 32.1 years in average.
“And another discrimination appears between women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have done elementary studies are married and have their first child before finding a stable employment, those who have conducted medium or high level studies convert this programme and give priority to obtain stability as a preliminary condition for marriage and a child’s argue,” states Mrs. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth
The Oreal Paris has just made a new name in his yellow list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German actor will enhance the image of a number of products of the mark, enthusiasting the universal decree "For I'm doing it well."
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most legative actrices of the international scene, is thus accompanying other collectivities recorded in the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope.
Before her, the latest to be in this club, if selected, were the Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Frida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetic mark also counts on luxe ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the Evangeline companion in Lost).
The prices of the British Mode
The British have much to say in the world of mode.
His largest representatives, creators and mannequins, of yesterday and today, gathered together for the annual release of their prices, which occurred in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the meeting.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chose the best mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's Axis Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poker de Ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty of "radiographies" writers who passed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He doesn't do it; the types of preconceived and apprehensive (biographic summary, life and work), but looking for something similar to the neck of ignorance of the person created.
The travel is exciting and Vincent does not spare fears or lighting.
A pleasant pleasure, this book is also an eminent invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here a few instincts.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulsion, almost alike that I felt without name: pleasing against the dead destination, moral without fault and innocentness without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "The Nihilist, the alegrian Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impugnation and ignorance, with a blooming poetic humor, denied in sense, as the lame of the cow that failed to kill him."
On Graham Greene: “Our husband was inspired by this woman of a tremendous patience, in the flesh of which he married the emotion of adulter to enjoy the refund, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the way of loss. ”
About James Joyce: “Ulysse was held in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the sums of eight thousand meters of the universal literature, which must be recorded by the north face, on which the best alpinists are still left and still taken. ”
About William Faulkner: "This was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the inheriter of a land owner of the comte and other times when he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer collected the dement cry moved from a pont by this person of Munch to carry his echo up to the end of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he made it in the flight of himself and called the posterity with a violent speech to the asticots. ”
On Dorothy Parker: “Every day she began to be gentle and prayed, “God, I pray you to do that I stop writing as a woman.”
About Joseph Conrad: “On his grave, the verses of Spenser were recorded: “The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the gate,/ the rest after war,/ after life, suffered destruction. ”
About Virginia Wolf: “In her baggage, she also carries her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edouard VII had epiced it between the azaleans or the birds sang in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and loved one whose literary talent exceeded the foolishness. "
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it is trying to dissimule Joyce with Baroja?
What if it's not to make Baroja fusil by Faulkner?
What did this happen if it is not to inspire the glory of this man to serve him of pedestal? »
A band of agression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, went in our quarter of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of youths passed around her and our dog, a blood-melle, saved from the SPA and weakened not more than six kilograms, and without saying, they sent him two shots of feet that left the hunt grewly hurt.
Our wrath is great because we don't see what there is fun to acknowledge freely a little animal without defense, which was also in layout.
It is necessary to acquire the incidence of a lady who was quiet and who, when she injured these individuals, feared for her integrity, because an energy that attacks a animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an older or, finally, anybody lower than him.
The episode takes place about 17 hours, a morning like another, in a usually quiet quarter.
The dog's kidding all day.
We have well heard the complaint to the committee of the quarter even if we doubt that this is a majority and that we do not touch the employment, we just want to determine that the lakes were Spanish.
The indignation brought us to deny that fact.
We don't understand what's happening with youths so that they find fun of being freely maltraining an animal without defense that gives us love, friendship and holds us company.
We don't know where the good education and respect of animals and people have passed.
Michelin and Fesvial, in the gateway port
The manufacturer of pneus Michelin, in relation to the Spanish Road Safety Fund (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the cask port, mainly with the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures today indicated.
This initiative is intended to make aware of the importance of the port of the cask, since it is the only protective element that allows the wounds of the head, or even death, if it is in two rounds.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign included its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and production of more safe products” and claimed that it contributed to this goal by other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign for cooling the castle gate in two rounds, under the decree "To be or not to be be", will be conducted a first phase during which shows will be distributed in more than 500 motorcyclet garages to ensure the largest diffusion.
Finally, Michelin highlighted that the road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a two-road pneumatic manufacturer, one of its main objectives is to develop more safe products.
The sale of commercial vehicles progresses
After almost two years, the trade vehicle market begins to see a little light at the bottom of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles in November in Spain represent a growth of 12,6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 months of decreasing, according to the numbers of the patronal syndicat of Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers, the conceitionary.
However, the good news should be announced, since the reference to the comparison, in November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the year.
Thus, despite the rebound of the last month, the recording in these 11 months is 40% under the exercise.
Since January, if all vehicles entered into the category of commercial vehicles are added (from tourism cars, pick-up, fire-nets, chassis cars) 95 853 were sold.
The greatest clouds that affect their request have not been so dismissed; in fact, although they are also buyed by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium companies, which pay in nearly 100% of cases through external funding.
In addition to restrictions involved by the limitation of credits, other factors such as the employment rate or the persistence of the bad economic conjonction must be acquired.
With regard to this situation and the difference of tourism vehicles, the aid to buy 2000E has been shortly used.
In addition to individuals, independents and MMEs who want to purchase a commercial vehicle of less than 3,5 tonnes with an emission level of Co2 that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit it, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, with Ganvam, we were reminded of the need for administration to attach special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (camions and bus).
The concessionaries provides a 2010 compared to the end, for which it calculates a loss of wines (turism vehicles and 4x4) of 19 %.
Aid to emergency freedom is now obligatory
As this occurred with the ABS brain locking system and as it will happen to the ESP stability control, the emergency fresh-feeding systems will constitute a mandatory element on European cars.
In addition, they are already obligatory on tourism cars and commercial vehicles newly inmatched, while for the rest of the vehicles a care period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, is aimed at strengthening the protection of petroleums, even if it, by its way of action, can also contribute to avoiding many back shocks.
The assistant in the emergency freshness acts by increaseing the pressure on the brains in case of emergency detected by the system by the driver's feet.
But this last does not always keep pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of bosch car components, a third of the drivers involved in an accident could not be able to press on the frein before the construction, and half of them did not benefit from all its force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in contrast, requires the maximum of the fresh system, reducing the distance of which the car is required to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 mortal accidents in which petroleums were involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the smart emergency breeding systems: it is estimated that a trigger on four with wounds would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, through a radar or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver, rather than acting on the brains.
If the driver reacts, he helps it by increaseing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it doesn't respond, and despite the inevitableness, the device exercises the maximum effort to minimise damage.
General Motors repairs the plan for Opel until January
While the workers of Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would have been made during the first April week – probably on 8th – after Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it would need more time to complete the Opel sugar plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each point of the plan has been approved in the preliminary of the parties concerned.
And this may include that the final document, which will be submitted to workers then to the governments of the countries where businesses are located, will be reported until the beginning of 2010.
However, with GM, a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has put the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with possible newx buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aims to buy Volvo, but the Netherlands Sport Cars candidate, supported by the Russian Group Converg, takes the importance.
Where there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold shall be maintained.
At the Porsche Boxster Spyder flight
To design their last and precious beauty, porsche engineers went from Boxster S and succeeded to start it with nothing less than 80 kg, which allows the balance to only 1 275 kg.
This led them first to pass from the automatic toilet that was replaced by a hand-bound tooth, which allowed to reduce from 21 kg, to use gates in aluminium like the GT3, 15 kg of less, to remove the climate, 13 kg, to reduce the residue of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kg of winners, to mount sports, 12 kg, and with 19 pounds pneus, five pounds.
Finally, they rejected the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replaced the pounds of the doors by tissues, economying the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the PDK box with double-scale, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the roads of the secondary network of California, in the mountain, with particular tortuous virages.
Its behaviour can be qualified only inappropriate.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car to rotate on the ground with aplomb.
In contrast, it was a long time that we had not tested such a small and small model that, at the same time, guarantees so much security in the virages, including great speed.
It's a little athlete, able to escape his small muscles during the time necessary, until we asked him to spinter, breathe, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to his direction, as specific as it says, the car will do what our hands will end on the flight.
And she'll do it with a chirurgical precision.
Sound of voluntary engine
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is especially successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or using a system that changes the engine smoking, already used on the Panamara.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either at the arrest or on the recovery.
Suspensions are closed, but not hard or inconscient.
The dressing of the roads we parked with Boyxster Spyder was quite obscured, but the car was well-handed with the powder nids.
Electronic assistants have made an act of presence on the whole trail, while on some virages we found a glass at the morning and the graves later in the morning.
Finally, a ultra-league car, most funeral to drive and which is much more than a simple change in Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of EUR 70 831.

Basconia offers a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral received a triomph of 91-82 during its visit on the ardue territory of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absents that the team of Dusko Ivanovic had suffered. She thus was in the head of her group, after the great spectacle of Mirza Teletovic, who, with eight pairs at three points, was the best of her team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to comply the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to get the victory.
Moreover, the big ability from the perimeter, with 16 pawns at three points, determined widely the final victory.
The match started quickly for blue and red, which took the benefit from the beginning.
The fact that the four first pairs of Vitoria's team were marked since the perimeter, it was that they had gone on the Israelian land with the warm pointings.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter time was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose the inner game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by claims and pleasures to return to his old house, to increase their benefit to pause (34-43).
Teletovic had already started to note as the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter had already seen that this night would not be the best of Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right road to pause, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remember the Vitoria that we don't win so easily on their ground, and by “Elias’ hand, ” they succeeded to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the benefit of the yellow (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from being dead, needed to enlarge some possible actions to take air, and at that moment the Mirza Teletovic mitraillette, which, with three consefficient triple bottles and the help of England and Ribas, sends the accounter to a reassurance score (54-67), and the locals succeededed to accentuate at the end of the third quart-time (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play all for all during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not leave anyone to take what they had deserved for the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three points line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic players did not predict themselves, defended well, and even though the Israelites were reproached at the last minute (80-85), the party was already played and the victory was escaped in Tel A ։
Worships prevent the Unicaja to deliver battle
Unicaja lost bruyamly in Greece against Olympias and ceded the head of the Euroligue Group B, during a match marked by the unicaja players' absents, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga's team has not been feared by the Paix and Amitious Pavilion, nor by the Rival Envergure, without doubt one of the most powerful Europe and having a large budget.
The first quarter game allowed the andalous to dream. A aggressive defense and three pairs at three conseftive points, two of the Omar Cook leader and one of Guillam Rubio who blowned the local team 12-18 at the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arisnal of the local team with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed the score 22-20, at the third minute, when an action, a bathroom beginning, between the Beverley-American minors and Williams led the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to work by showing his supremeness in the two camps, while the outcome for the wound of Joel Freeland pivot and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were weakened on Unicaja.
Internal players and Lithuanian ailer Linas Kleizas, with their three-point pairs, increased the benefit 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
Unable to mount
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, showed higher and even came to compare the difference of the meeting discussed in Malaga 66-48 at the twenty-seventh minute, making the group's head changing.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absents and the last outcome of the Scotch pivot Robert Archibald, hurt during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, through its organization, three points of Cook, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57 at the thirty-and-one minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because Olympiacos would be incomplete when players pressed and showed their supremeness in metrometers in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, succeeded to return the score to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submits, accepting the Olympias victory.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve in accordance with their profile, using a new Trovit application, the research engine with the largest number of small immobile announcements, jobs and vehicles in Spain.

Since a week the application worked, the research engine detected that, in general, the Spanish worker “founds badly recompensed”, explained in a question the responsible for the products of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data that Trovité is available from its research engines to the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least paid.
A British informal programmer receives 45 226 annual brutal euros and a French, 31 059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver received 34 247 annual brutal euros in the territory, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.

Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's department
The Brazilian Government set a time for the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its ambassade of Tegucigalpa.
The repeated President shall leave the diplomatic employment at the latest on 27 January 2010, date of the end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, charged by Brazil's ambassador in the capital of Honduras, confirmed at the Globo TV that "Me" knows that he must leave the ambassade, where he has been repeated since September 21, before that date.
“He has a conscience that he must go on 27 January on the end of his mandate, he must seek another destination. ”
The chain also quoted the former mandatary, who confirmed his intention to leave the ambassade before the time set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
According to the elections of 29 November (in the course of which Porfirio Lobo was chosen), Zelaya assured that he would remain in Brazil's ambassade until January.
However, on the same week, he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya had the condition of political exhibition that would impose to her the government of fact presidency by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
In the past days, the inflation of assets has been the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty is once again, which is not surprising because it is their natural status, in a environment where the agents take decisions on an incertain future.
The remedy used by the central banks to stabilise markets was to currency the debt by direct purchasing of assets and indirectly by giving sufficient liquidity to close rates of zero, so that financial institutions purchase assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without repealing their non-conformist liquidity policy, begin to put a little sand in the roads, as the ECB has made, with their adjudication for a year of the next week.
Therefore, investors have the ability of the world economy to maintain a economic renewal without hetherodox measures, and we are going to contribute to the inversion of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the bourses and the disclosure of the commitments of the enterprises increases again, although they remain very remote from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been binding to socialize the private risk and the debt is again affected.
There is again an envelope to the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refugees selected by investors, providing a increase in differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was very touched by this episode of instability, but then the Standard & Poor'sa threatened to a new review at the lack of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to kill the defensors of the moral risk, who were trying again to cause a case of consciousness to the responsibles of the world economic policy that had dismissed the destructive effects of the limitation of the credit on the destruction of employment, while what it was to do is to determine a new day of thanksgiving.
However, Dubai's situation refers to a tribal fight between the e’s to return its position to the power in the emirates, and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that disimilates a public deficit, elections, and a new government which covers the pot to the roses.
Prodi the work in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin will save Hungary from a non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a Member State in the euro area to not comply with its commitments.
Instead, it is logical that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens coherent to the need for extraordinary measures to maintain its financial stability.
If, as we hope it, we are faced with a normalization episode of transitional risk premiums, after some excise in high positions, it would be prepared.
In Spanish case, as long as our debt separates increased in the obligations of European enterprises, we do not need to be concerned.
If the European divorces were decreased and ours continued to increase, it would then be a Spanish idiosyncrosis risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our previsional indicators bind most of the studies to predict their back-up models and revise their previsions for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not have much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the instant “destination is a mother of security”.
Connected Sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommission of the Congrès of the Members, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed in these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán was disturbed for the pressure that he had expressed before the subcommittee at eight times.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest $50.000 million until 2020 and $60.000 more between that date and 2030, where nuclear centres today would remain open.
If that is not the case, the necessary investments would not be 60 million but 95 000.
In contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be dedicated to the production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Since 2020, the issue will change, and the strength will be increased.
It is also on gas centres as well as on carbon, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, in particular, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW are more needed, with other "support energy".
Galán, who believes that the draft for sustainable economy law that the Government has soon approved is in the context of what he claims to his business, did not want to attack the king's decree aimed at encouraging the national carbon consumption, which contrarys the climate relief policy.
It states that there is “a long-term pari” in this sense, despite the "pointuels" measures, as the President of Iberdrola qualified them.
Otherwise, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are on the long term, should be taken, because they set a certain time before they reach their maturity and that a stabil remunerator is necessary to overcome them.
Ferrovial wins the air maintenance market in ten airports
The Swiss Swissport firm, Ferrovial branch for airport services on earth, will play the privileged partner role of the Irish Air Air Company Aer Lingus for good services in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, France or Brussels are part of the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Castilla-La Mancha Board and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol for the creation of the Centre of Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructure.
The covenant provides a investment of 20 million until 2012, with 50 per cent from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will perform research on energy efficiency on the aircraft and airports.
Acciona disputes its first authorout in Hochtief and Bouygues
Aciona fights for its first authorisation in conceition, market on which it already works as energy and water manager.
The player is an estimated tunnel of $1.700 million (approximately $1.077 million).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief company are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian town of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Aciona to be established in the country as public and conceived business.
The town's office wishes to be able to have it for the end of 2014.
After you have chosen the public/private Propertyation (PPP for its initials in →ais) to carry out the project, in the framework of a business plan under the Erns & Young Tutorial, the local administration has already a list of finalists that will be loaded from the player and the exploitation of the pige.
In the expectation of the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment is EUR 1 700 million (approximately EUR 1 047 million) and in the last phase three consortiums, with a significant presence of European producers.
The Baptized Transcity group is conducted by Acciona, the only Spanish company in liss, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European subterranean travel specialists.
In contrast to the Aăona team, Consortium Northern 日, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French Bouygues Constructor Group.
The third and last consortium that tried is LBRJV, whose capital is divided between Australian Leighton (the German Construction Authority, which has a tour of the ACP participation), another local company, Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Gallusian company specialised in the public travels, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large songs and privatizations, but entering there is a great difficulty, if it is not by the way of achieving a local building company.
A strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, besides their Asian references, which remains a non-valid step for Spanish gentlemen in the sector.
ÂS is unfortunate to conquer a place on this market by its participation of 30% in Leighton’s owner.
Millionary activity
The Association has placed on a geographical air of the greatest importance for the sector, which already has a large presence through its energy provider activities and in the dissalinisation sector.
It has, among other actives, a largest eolian park, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and managed the collection of hosted companies and managing the Adelaïde disolinisator with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to benefit synergies to enter the building and infrastructure management markets.
The underground road, promoted by the City Infrastructure Bureau of Brisbane and Northern Link (Northern Link), is called to link the Western Occidence of Toowong to the device road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 km of tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce the compression of traffic in Brisbane.
The calendar set by the administration indicates that the adjudication will occur during the age of 2010 and that the travels will begin in December of the next year.
Despite the fact that this pigeway will be opened at the end of 2014 trading, it is not intended to end the song before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
He will comprehend two ways, a electronic pig system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will offer $500 million (308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make a broad fruitage of Hochtief, which mentioned yesterday the receipt of a contract with the government evaluated by 154 million.
The company undertaken by S will, through its local branch Leighton, equip the infrastructure of the high-depth national network in optical fibres.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have a quick access to the Internet and to provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the enterprise was the project of building the King George tour, of 27 stages, in Brisbane city. The travels have not yet started and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more precisely in Manchester, it will share the building and management of two school groups for 25 years with Laing O'Rourke.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is seen to adjud a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine branch, is seen to adjudicate the building of a tunnel of 2.5 km long for an authorout in Slovenia for a total of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract a few days after it had been loaded from Bosruck tunnel enlargement travels (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolides his experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the song is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its performance will take 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore seems to be adjudicated by Renfe's publicity
Renfe has granted publicity and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros per year, indicated the railway operator.
The contract refers to the possibility of two prolongations of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore was chosen among 16 agencies who were presented to the call for the Renfe offer, among whom four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity during the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be loaded from the design and production of campaigns.
An amendment of 63 million in France Télécom to free competition
The French competition regulator involved an amendment of 63 million euros in France Télécom for its anticoncurrentive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition on the fixed and mobile phone by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by faithfulness programmes to consumers in the context of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopolie and still a stated undertaking, more than 450 million euros in amends since 1994, due to the obstacles he has made to his competitors.
The inflicted sanction yesterday has been increased because the authority that cares for competition considers that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and that it is therefore repeated.
An application buffer
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephone office followed the sillage of other operators and opened a Internet application bucket, with a view to acquiring the receipts that are not from the voice transmission.
In the past, the box of Orange applications will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to reach in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions Ligue reported 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions Ligue became a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, the Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelone won 467,4 million, which placed them in the third and fifth place of clubs that had the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is headed on the list.
Manchester United is headed on the list.
To gag the EUFA Champions Ligue is not only the glory; it is also one of the main income sources of the large clubs.
In fact, the competition has distributed 5 362,5 million euros to 105 teams (in 12 Spanish) which have participated in the event since the development of the tournoi during the 1992-1993 session of the EUFA information.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well used in this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only, with the A.C. Milan, has received the trophee three times.
The catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Coupe in 1992, is fifth on the list.
On a list head, Manchester United and Bayern de Munich, the two teams who also made the most money for their participation in the last Champions Ligue.
And that, though they had lost before the Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, regarding the money reported by the Champions Ligue, although it has received more titles than any other (five, while Italy has received four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This paradox appears to be explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of the money applied by the EUFA.
For this year, the president of Michel Platini would win 1 090 million through the Champions Ligue.
From this sum, EUFA will dedicate 413,1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classing matches (including the Atletic of Madrid) received 2.5 million.
Moreover, those who succeeded to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each party available.
There is also a bonus in the case of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those coming in eight-year-old finally receive three million each, the eight teams that come to the end are 3,3 million.
The last four teams will receive every 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, face 5,2 receipt by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and at least 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça emphasised 2,5 million to have received the Super Coupe of Europe in a aula.
In addition, there are different payments, which are 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attracted places.
The year's campaign emphasizes 40% of the interested money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group numbered the details of the buying of actions which it intended to buy a maximum of 25 to 29,9 % of the Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force him to launch an acquisition offer (OPA) for all the titles.
Concerningly, New Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per action, which will be delayed in 10 years and will be paid by 1 per cent per year for this report.
Yesterday, Sos' actions ended at 1,85 euros, so the New Rumasa offer evaluates 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the nomination of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period to indicate their interest in the sale of licences.
The CNMV had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that she had contacted the regulator.
If it had happened, the delay would be 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
By waiting, Sos continues to replace its direction.
In an attempt to stay outside of possible purchases and offers and goes and comes Judicians from her former leaders, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced Mary Luis Jordan’s election as a guide for internal audit.
A decision that actually the first woman is to take a position managing in the food business.
It is a newly created post that will be directly dependent on the President of the Group.
And it is not free of polyemic, because the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed decline of more than 230 million of Sos to Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility that in the next months, Sos reveals new funds declines cannot be separated.
As regards the credit to Salazar, the elderly advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the decline of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorises Paternina's exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Commission on the Values Market (CNMV) authorised the OPA of exclusion submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory obligation explained that it authorised this operation because it understood that its terms were adjusted to the applicable standards and that it considered "adequate" the content of the explicit faith submitted, after the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 actions from Federico Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per action, which represents 8,95 % of the social capital, consisting of 6 142 786 negotiations on Madrid and Bilbao bourses.
In addition, he explained that 5 592 778 million actions were immobilized and that they could not be transmitted in any way before the conclusion of the offer, which he indicated that the price was fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New car expertise tools
In these days of bad time and time, car garages are not the only winners.
Each day, thousands of cars that have fallen in an insult are returned to a garage, where a expert must evaluate the deficiencies and the cost of the repair.
Each injury is different, and the calculation of the costs and time of work can be a long and complex work.
Calculating in hand the cost of a repair comprised between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including shares and work hands, may take two or three hours.
However, with the help of the recent information tools, it would be a question of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the evaluation of disturbances and maintenance are included in the collection of information provided by manufacturers, to then treat them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of North American Solera group, is the leader undertaking; 80% of the estimates are performed with its products.
Other competitive companies in the field of evaluation and development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from being simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, a commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
Moreover, the quantity of data to be treated has been stopped, even in the last five years, more versions, variants and engineering have been acquired than during the fifty years.
When a new car comes on the market, these enterprises are working.
This is a very hot work, because each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogized and inscribed its price.
Furthermore, a "intelligent" graphical image of each model is set on which you can click on the different parts of a tourism car.
If this is a massively sold model, the work can be prepared in a week if the process is very quickly in progress.
If this is a little selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information on Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in employment, the number exceeds 99 %.
In order to perform the documentation and processing of databases, Audatex has eight worldwide centres (in Spain, France, Germany, United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them is specialized in certain marks.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) working on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this large information flow allows these companies to give them different uses and to propose different products.
The most common application relates to the repair and maintenance, but, depending on countries, there are also tools for the management of cash parts or to calculate the value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of opportunity cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does it to the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to make a idea of the type of support that it can provide to the professionals of the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the fair product as AudaPlus, the standard solution for the evaluation of the currencies, intended for experts.
There are cars, motors, industrial vehicles and wears.
Besides the cost of the pieces, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the penting barèmes.
This tool is bought according to its use, for each estimation.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75 for customers who use it at least ten times per month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is out of the mount chain, only using its chassis number.
AudaGlass is on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open server in the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to buy on stated epave vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemography analyses or know coherent problems by mark or by model.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a specific mark have gone to the garage for a panel or how serious injuries have occurred for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company which is dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
