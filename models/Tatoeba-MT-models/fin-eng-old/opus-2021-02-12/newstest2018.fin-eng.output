Camille Auer wanted to fix her gender, diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject - "People should have the right to their own body"
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the ceiling of Project Room at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Each of them has Camille Auer's name on it.
Papers tell a multi-annual story about how outsiders have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell you a person about my medical history in order to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
By the process, he refers to the gender adjustment process.
It is often a period of years of research involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to diagnostic studies on "gender identity disorder" carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered over the Internet and was well advanced in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the correction process so that gender can also be corrected legally.
The Transjugation Act (563/2002) obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilisation in order to bring the right sex into the population register centre and passport, for example.
At the moment, every gender-corrector is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of infertility.
It is the right of a person to decide his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights", says Auer.
Translain reform has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary ruling obliging the parties to the ECHR to respect their sovereignty.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a change of law under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, then Minister for Social Affairs and Health.
There was an election and the Finns of Peru rose to the government.
Now the legal amendment is stuck again.
These are domestic political disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about the amendment of the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty's Finnish Department.
The front part of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One consists of the packaging and instructions for use of medicines used by Auer.
In the Patient Report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by a psychologist at the Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and, on the basis of these, wrote a report that would define the treatment of Auer’s right and assistance.
The consciousness of the reality to be studied manifests itself vulnerable to destabilization.
The student’s perception of himself appears to be fragmented in a borderline way, and the unstable personality traits are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," says Auer.
The shock was even greater when Auer was not given gender-repair treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked out the waiting hall of the transpol.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer recited his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but they need a diagnosis to remove their breasts," says Auer.
Your body is not your own if you feel that you are anything more than the amount of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not unique.
The gender adjustment process is more severe for many mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its students meet dozens of people who need to be justified on their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy for people who need support and help to be denied treatment, claiming that their resources are not sufficient," says Auer.
Many people who have entered the process have a history of mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
On these grounds, medical staff may order that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Preventing treatment and help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process started," says Auer.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something people usually find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started using hormones, feeling better.
He had finally been able to write the feelings that had existed in childhood and teens.
Why the wide jaw did not seem to fit your body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a steady chest.
What's important to Auer is that there are people around him who can see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Now Auer already feels like he's been seen. She exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the occasional comments of those close to us could hurt a lot.
What hurts the most is when people close to you misgender.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they will not agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
Not all transhumans, however, need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, there can be no formal confirmation of one’s gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for recognising the legal sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination with regard to the legal sex.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code, stating that he/she is of a different sex.
After six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry assigns him a new personal identity code.
This self-determination is also required in Finland, and the Auer exhibition also sums up this requirement.
It has not been a therapy experience for an artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

The Civil Rights Association issued a travel warning in Missouri
The National Association for African-American Civil Rights (NAACP) has issued a travel warning against Missouri due to discriminatory practices and racist attacks by the state.
“The NaaCP Missour travel bulletin enters into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state where there have recently been a number of questionable racial events”, states the association’s press release.
The recent law in Missouri makes it difficult to bring cases of discrimination to justice, and the enforcement of state laws is disproportionate to minorities, which, according to the NAACP, led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and abused or killed," said Rod Chapel, president of NAACP Missouri, to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time."
The travel bulletin for Missouri is the first warning for the state of the United States of America.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and the Missouri police arrested him even though he wasn't charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to the Missouri Attorney General’s report that the police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to encourage people to be alert and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People must prepare themselves, for example, by including money for bail or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, the 16th highest in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for companies to be sued for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
Recently, ACLU, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after adopting immigration laws that oblige police to arrest people for immigration offences, which, according to the organization, increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently they have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO's supplementary pension
The Minister for Economic Affairs, Mika Lintilä (centrally) has asked Finnair to report on the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo," says Yle.
According to the minister, it contradicts the state's will.
The EUR 130 000 supplementary pension received by the company was raised this week as Helsingin Sanomat reported on the development of the remuneration of the directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
More than half of Finnair is owned by the State.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's corporate governance policy decision.
The sanctions immediately made the speeches tougher
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
During the G20 meeting in Hamburg, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, seemed to be getting along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were bitterly reacted in Russia.
The most stunning answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who said that the sanctions law signed by Trump means a 'full-scale trade war'.
Even if the Russian reactions were to be offset only by political rhetorical escalations and excesses, there is a fact that the United States and Russia are tightening up after a short honeymoon after Trump’s election.
In the United States, it was not simple to pass through the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Although the Congress did adopt the law with considerable unanimity, it was reportedly far more difficult for the President to adopt the law.
In fact, Trump has recently criticised the law he signed as 'significantly inadequate'.
It must have been Russia, in particular, that is responsible for President Trump's arrogance, even though the adoption of a law restricting his own prerogatives must have been repugnant.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States of the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential elections as well as of the links of Trump's campaign with Russia.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed rapidly and a series of scandalous twists have almost been revealed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that foreign policy in the United States is not conducted under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
This is certainly not a desirable situation.
If the relationship with Russia is Kimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, on the face of it, the interests of the Member States are very different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
There has been a fear in the EU that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, by the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly by Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidicity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of, for example, the U.S. economy’s important liquid gas ing.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics to show disapproval.
Economic sanctions must, however, be well thought out and rigorous.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than beneficial.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has the Statue of Liberty in its sights.
The most certain sign of a change of power is to intervene in the statues.
The Americans know this as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, brought down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideals of the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with Jim Acosta on CNN channel. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a verbatim on the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller wasn't really criticizing the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise organizers and image of Liberty impersonating characters.
His attack was on the significance of the statue, especially the addition of Emma Lazarus’ poem — 17 years after the statue was finished — to the statue’s pedestal in 1903.
This is how Miller beat Acosta: "I don't want to go any further into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of the American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller himself was not wrong, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
The most important are the touching words of Lazarus, the only words of its kind, in which the state not only invites immigrants, but "the poorest of the poor": "Your Tired, your Poor, / Your Huddled Masses yearning to great free, / The written return of your teaming shore."
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism, he made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The controversy over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus ’ friends campaigned for a poem to be attached to the statue’s pedestal. They knew well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American republicanism in a classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
Linking the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to its original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouther who can now be regarded as some sort of sign of Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early forerunner of neoconservatives, who takes the torch from the United States to the world of darkness: "Lady Liberty comes forward.
He's taking the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not point the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and weary but hopeful immigrants after a long and trialsome journey on the deck of the ship.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's exactly what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their torch does not point the way, but stirs up the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
Athletics World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots got on the British national team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the British Association for Athletics, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships for Athletics in London on Friday.
According to Black, in Scotland "there is something special happening" which British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I had a discussion with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it had something to do with the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Association for Athletics, on the other hand, believes that it has something to do with the association's activities.
and the British Association for Athletics believes that it is behind their activities.
And the average street walker thinks he has to have something to do with it.
However, it is something absolutely wonderful, whatever the reason for it."
Many Scottish athletes are in serious competition for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre race. Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly magnificent," Black says.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and were strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had real feelings and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist in the 400-metre fence race for the Commonwealth Championships, and this is his fifth world championship. He thinks it's "unbelievable" that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven in 1983 and 2015.
During the year, the average runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records.
He's competing in London for 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 meters in London. He is also worth keeping an eye on: the man has an excellent season behind him, including his winnings in the UK World Championships and the Annual Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scot on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he's "extremely proud" of having so many Scots with him, some of whom really compete for the finals and medals.
"It is also a great honour to be a captain, but it is even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," says Doyle.
"I'm of course very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes who compete for the prize.
My captain's speech?
I thought it was all right.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not run for public office if you cannot take criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics, always in his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as foolish and silent as sheep to be slaughtered," said Washington in 1783.
Which brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff have deleted at least 450 comments and blocked their performers from his official Facebook page.
The United States League of Civil Rights sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff consider the challenge to be unfounded, and the attitude was also understated on the web.
"What's the difference? This is just Facebook," a lot of people commented.
But it matters.
especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a state ruled by Democrats.
He's got the second best ratings of his operations among 50 governors.
Hogan is not responsive to hothead.
He has led the state firmly and he has adhered to principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and there published a picture of a balding head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users on the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor’s page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax money.
Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, who said it was just a matter of moderating comments.
However, it is too easy to label commentators as trolls, spammers or haters.
The Washington Post interviewed users that Hogan blocked on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders of their choice, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told us that their comments were respectful, considerate, and proper.
In his comment the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely remarked that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments from the Washington Post.
"I also cannot accept that, when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as an organised group and ignore, as a large group, the concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "centralized attack" and someone else might call them the promotion of what was considered important.
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to control by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But the truth is, it's the same thing. Now it's just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
He has been sued by Twitter users prevented by President Trump.
The first major decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheris, judge of the District Court of Alexandria, the Loudoun County Government violated the first amendment of the US Constitution by blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the United States League of Civil Rights went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
At the time of Washington, cheap postal charges had a similar effect to those on the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
There were trolls back then.
Names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to newspapers barking at Washington’s decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions that criticised Jay's agreement, the United States-British cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, which is reflected in documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, plus online ads from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from South and Varsinais-Suomi, but then also from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, specialist researcher Marja Isomursu Evira says.
Greenbirds have died of a parasitic disease called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a scientific protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It's been known to hit pigeons in the past, especially the pigeon.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected in finnish birds.
The year 2009 was a big bang.
At the time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland’s green finnish stock, after which the species’ stocks have been recovering.
There have been sick green finches now, but not yet on a large scale," says Juha Honkala, Museum Manager at the University of Helsinki Museum of Natural Sciences.
It is feared that the last outbreak of green finches will recur if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field presence for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East London organises the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year Rafferty from Northern Ireland conducted a tournament next door at Archerfield Links before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is pleased with the new place and acts as an ambassador for the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will bring it to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at its best, and it's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador to the game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
The tournament is a great show-off for this field."
Eales, an Englishman, defends the championship for the first time, even though he has won both a European tour and a European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This seems like a very special occasion," says the player in Southport.
"I didn't get to defend my Extremadura Open victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr is going back to action on his own soil, and he went on a tour earlier this year after he was 50 years old.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing in the area is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will take part: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
In Säkylä, possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found at least so far in the Pori brigade’s communication company’s barracks building, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Inland air studies will continue.
The studies began when the man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought that his health had deteriorated due to bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other military personnel.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that other servants in that unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
At the moment it is not known that we have any indoor air problem," Holma says.
The Brigadier's press release states that the arrival in July meant that goods had to be transferred to the barracks, which may have led to a temporary increase in dustiness.
The air may have seemed stuffy because of it," Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s Goldland
Bardina Degei doesn't use the stove to cook.
He doesn't even use the kettle very often.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the troubled province of Papua Indonesia.
After half an hour, the burnt sweet potato is devoured with bare, unwashed hands.
There is no furniture in Degei’s home. He sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually takes care of his daily chores, such as washing in the muddy water from the nearby swamp.
The toilet office is provided by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband’s four wives and has not been assigned fields for treatment.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the village’s men are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and the soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk into the village after five o'clock in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded by a controversial referendum, where 1,026 settlements were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta regime, which keeps the region under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is secluded and bleak. The journey starts with an hour and a half flight from the province capital to Nabire, from Jayapura to Nabire, and continues on a belly-torn five-hour drive by a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
In a city of about 19,000 inhabitants, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, the corrugated roofs of which have been dyed into yellow brown.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have these clothes," Degei says. He means his colorful hand-woven sheath, dark skirt and brightly colored blouse.
"We used to have nothing but leaves covered in our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold.
Paniai is about the size of a New Jersey highland area with 153 000 inhabitants, only about 100 kilometres from Pania is Grassberg, the world’s largest and most lucrative gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix, U.S.A.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion in gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, for they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, and that individual officers were paid up to $150,000.
Papua’s demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian army has killed over 500 000 Beans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, massacres in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s were the proportions of genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful demonstrations.
Brisbane Archdiocese’s report We Will Lose Everything from 2016 contains reports of the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and ruthless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are weekly cases," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened when Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing when the Indonesian people from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move to the region in search of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Javan warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado-enhanced peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"The movers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market place cheaper than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the capital of the province after work.
"Local women lost their clients."
In his 2014 election campaign, President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised to address Papua’s injustices and human rights violations.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," you say.
The Panias experienced some kind of debacle just two months after Jokow’s inauguration in October.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by the fire at Enarotal on 7 December 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
Scared kids told the soldiers they should use headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and the Witnesses, drunk soldiers caught the children and beat them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of an assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Beans — young men and women and children — gathered in the football field before the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They had hunting springs for celebrations, and they began playing the traditional Waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they danced in the ring and imitated the bird song.
Some protestors began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto area, suspected that the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told Time magazine on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"Many shots were fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," told Yohanes TIME, saddened. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... and I kissed him."
Chief Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only protecting the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papua Police Department in 2015.
"Then it's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The next day, the news of the deaths came to Jakarta.
Three weeks later, in Jayapura, Jokowi gave an emotional speech expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising that violence in Papua would be tackled.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that no such thing will ever happen again."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Mr Wiranto, said that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the judicial system.
However, he began to recant immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he was not going to start studies in Papua.
"It's all settled in court," he told me.
The UN accuses Wiranto of 'crimes against humanity', crimes related to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai have a gloomy disbelief in their claims.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired of this already."
He says that he is still living in fear, even though it has been years.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panais are afraid to discuss the event.
He reports that the soldiers had abused him after he helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will find me after they bury the victims," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighborhood of Paniai in Deiyai.
One was killed and 17 were injured in the conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which originated when the manager refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital, including children.
The man who needed hospital care was a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in the water while fishing on a nearby river, and died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitaries opened fire toward the mob, killing one of the villagers.
"We're terrified of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police who shot them to be held accountable and the removal of the mobile police unit.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development is fueling discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which live on Papua’s lush midships.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels claiming to defend the rights of the Beans by means of random attacks and kidnappings of soldiers from the Indonesian army.
Some of the OPM leaders are Panias, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arresting and arbitrarily imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of 'ensuring national sovereignty'.
Some of the detainees will never come back.
Among the Beans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds on discontent.
Enarotal has little rice for sale, and it's too expensive for the locals,
Like bread.
People grow their own food — mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the income of locals and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants than locals.
Few beaners have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"The young do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
The outlying Papua will be ignored in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua even though they had been granted a rare permission to photograph.
According to the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kine, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency or contributed to development by removing the restrictions on news coverage.
"The journalists reporting from the troubled eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and Western Papua, have new risks: visa refusal and blacklisting," said Kine in his opinion.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is only under pressure from neighbouring Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "numbers and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesperson of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, denied the allegations and told journalists in Jakarta that 'Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations'.
The locals want the foreign governments to intervene.
When the official Dutch delegation led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom," says the anonymous source who participated in the meeting.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the Beans report that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokow means well, but there are people around him who are involved in Paniai's shooting," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Canaanites: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in want and poverty, practically without health services and education opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Canaanites, like the rest of the Beans, regard their votes to Jokowi as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of Paniai’s shooting once again demonstrated a symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in the land across the street from the police station and the army’s headquarters.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," says Yacobus.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks at the cancellation of Robert Helenius' rematch: "Even their own fans do not want to see"
The heavyweight fighters Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were supposed to fight on May 27 in the Hartwall arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora will roll over the cause of the rematch completely on Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland was a failure, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland. I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora rudes.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial penalty.
The ticket sales of the rematch were slow, and its promoter, Nisse Sauerland, told the Evening Sanomat in May that the match had been moved to autumn.
There's been no news of the match since then.
However, Chisora is no longer annoyed by the cancellation.
The fight would probably have had to be cancelled anyway when Chisora got sick.
Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I need surgery, Chisora says.
The British say they're in about 45 percent condition at the moment.
I don't think he's interested in a rematch with Helenius. He's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat for Whyte in December with scattered voices.
Fire took over Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time.
The flames took over the world's highest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of people were forced to flee from a 79-story building 337 meters high.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was evacuated and no one is known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Department, the fire was extinguished at four o’clock in the morning and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Directors of the Torch building commissioned a study that found that the most damage was caused by the sheets used to cover the façade and to isolate it.
In Great Britain, the police believe that the insulating and cloaking plates of the Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid advance of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was Sky Team Monkey.
It's red in color, and the license plate is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
The police will request observations of the moped or its theft by e-mail to This email address is being protected from spambots.

Modified on 3.8.2017 at 12.40: The police announced that the moped has been found.
In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited items on board, reveals a survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of the passengers in the United States had deliberately or unwittingly taken prohibited objects to airplanes past the U.S. Traffic Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of the passengers had knives or other items with blades that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent reported having only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the questionnaire and were carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
19.7% of passengers knowingly violating TSA rules were members of the Y generation and less than 15% were members of the X generation.
The most common violation was the introduction of food and liquids into the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted knowingly that they had taken items with blade on board, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported knowingly taking banned drugs on board.
Passengers from all over the United States participated in the survey. The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many smuggled goods had accidentally passed security checks and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most frequent travellers also most likely pass security checks — knowingly or unwittingly.
However, as the company that conducted the survey notes, TSA’s instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids are allowed on the plane and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of the seizures of the TSA are liquid.
For a time there was also the belief that books should not be taken into the aircraft.
Liquids are allowed for domestic flights, but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, backed up his decision to delay the decisions taken during Obama’s period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had sued Scott Pruitt, head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog emissions during Obama’s administration.
According to Mr Pruitt, the change shows that the agency that he runs takes better account of the needs of the environmental policy makers in the Länder than the previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention a single word of the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Länder should start to comply with the ground-level ozone standards as of 1 October 2015.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year in order to give his agency more time to look into the plan, because the agency 'does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth'.
Pruitt was a public prosecutor for the state of Oklahoma before he was appointed as head of the EPA by President Donald Trump, known as Pruitt as opposed to stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to mitigate the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington issued a ruling that the EPA Director exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration's decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged the companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement made on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his turn on the ozone rules only strengthens the EPA's cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements on time.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines and then expected that the activists' groups and others would challenge it to the right to reach an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said. He challenged the Agency more than ten times in his previous action.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use its "power to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans are pushing for a wider change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The objective of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The New York State Public Prosecutor Eric Schneider, who led the EPA’s Association of States this week, said that the group was going to continue to exert pressure.
"The change of mind in the EPA as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," Schneider said.
In addition to New York, the action involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Surface ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitive groups of people, and it also contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt’s unexpected change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to ensure that the guy in charge of our breathing air used common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump regime, for its ideological aim is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interest groups."
From a supercar manufacturer coming up a street SUV, "happens in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while at the same time trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari's style," CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News.
All measles cases in East Savo of the same type of virus
The measles infection in the coastal Strait is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, reports THL.
On Thursday, the Virology Laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has ensured that the fifth measles infection in East Savo is the same strain of virus with previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July in a beach-salmish person has the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo.
Based on this information, all infections in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have no other types of measles virus.
It is possible, however, that new infections can still occur after the fifth person has been infected until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not yet over," says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for the basic health care of Soster.
Since the fifth confirmed case, no new measles infections or suspicions have been identified.
However, it is also important for everyone to ensure the timeliness of their own vaccination protection," Erkkilä reminds us.
More on: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for an authorised scream
Pontika's soup wasn't even considered for legalization.
On the basis of the argument that the process produces not only liquor but also methanol, which is toxic.
Making a scream at home is legal next year, but legalizing moonshine soup is not even considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, and the moonshine is distilled.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces not only liquor but also methanol, which is toxic.
There is no political will to turn moonshine soup into everyman's right, Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry was preparing the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of moonshine was not considered to be legalised.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of the distillery," says Mr Outi Mäkelä (C.E.).
He is a member of the parliamentary groups of the government parties, who took a stand on the reform of the alcohol law.
You can't even promise to distill a moonshine at home in the future.
Commercial manufacturing is also subject to authorisation.
Importation tells us that there is a simple rule for home making alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be made at home by visiting.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can make legally screams at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of screams, Mäkelä specifies.
Preparation must still be made in such a way that the raw materials or flavourings produced during fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, beverages can be made for themselves as much as they want, and self - made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It must still not be sold.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland," Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalised.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The bill on alcohol is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be before Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session will be held on 5 September.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital because of suspected heart attack.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital this morning accompanied by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison publicist confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for medical examinations.
The spokesperson of the Pistorius family, on the other hand, said that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Flattened phone conversations reveal that Trump was putting pressure on Mexico to build a border wall.
Teleconferencing between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders has leaked to the Washington Post.
On 27 January 2017, Trump called on the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop making public speeches about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States was blaming Nieto for having knocked out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a littration of Trump’s first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange of words took place.
Mr Trump said to Mr Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would accept refugees on their way to Australia was 'derising', 'poor' and 'dumb'. According to Mr Trump, the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like an 'idiot' because he had proposed a ban on the colonisation of refugees in the United States.
Trump hung up by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day long".
Georgia’s Massacre: The Activists re-created racist lynching in the hope of justice
A Ford Mercury car bypasses the crowd in Monroe’s small town of Georgia in rural Georgia and continues towards the small Moore’s Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and looks through the windshield.
The passengers are afraid.
"Roger, n---w!" man swerves.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a resembling that was presented on 22 July 2017.
The sighs of shock, however, are genuine when the noose is threaded around the neck of Roger.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to rearrange events in 1946, when Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It's confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with resembling.
"It is a disgrace of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs upon our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian congressman.
For him, resembling is a startling invitation to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice. We want things to be concluded at last, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers up the body of the victim who died in the Georgia massacre on July 27th, 1946.
According to FBI documents received on NBC news, over 50 men were suspected of lynching Monroe and surrounding counties.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives for lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, blacks in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential election by a decision of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in April, and the election took place in the summer.
According to the FBI, at the time of the election, there was an incident where black landlord Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight apparently involving his wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there was a rumor in the city that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her.
According to FBI records, a powerful white landowner, Loy Harrison, bailed out Malcolm's $600 bail against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey were accompanied by Malcolm and Dorothy.
The mob stopped their car before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a voter murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has redirected the massacre in Georgia for almost a decade.
This is an extremely realistic and captivating proposal, a description of the shocking racism that many people would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't make a relationship with you if you don't hear me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors — about a dozen blacks and twenty whites — gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the local leader of Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
"It makes me feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of history be kept on the table so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show starts with a scene where Malcolm screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me?
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
And then there's the shot.
And then everything (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hard way.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene says.
"I just don't think the white people used the word n---u at the time."
"Yeah," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, because they want to honor the memory of those who died.
The scene starts all over again.
Now Rascona's words are sensitizing.
No one's laughing.
The remodeling will end quickly and violently.
Screams, shots — and silence.
A woman in a black funeral dress stands by the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks with every other word.
A few ten yards away, about 50 spectators wipe sweat and tears out of their eyes.
Almost half the audience is black and half is white.
There is a couple who have come to see a performance in Ithaca, New York, but most of them are local.
They have visited the graves of the victims under Brooks' guidance in Georgia's oppressive humidity.
The murders have turned the story into reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song show, Greene invites the crowd to search the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and immobilized bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters like he's reminding himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who played lynchers take off their robes and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local leader of Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough show.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show is comforting.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors gather for a dinner together.
The white couple from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the feelings of the performance.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible things that people say and do that look like you – precisely because they look like you," he says.
"I was made to realize that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for the audience sitting at the same table.
He's already told me he's started planning next year's show.
"It is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Steeping vegetables in shops is: This is what it actually saves by removing "extra parts"
Is it permissible to remove cauliflower leaves before weighing?
How about taking out a big piece of the pineapple... that weighs as much as it weighs?
The answers are strongly shared: for one, it is an expression of extreme snooping, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that are not used and yet go home to the garbage.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket, the vegetable department of Helsinki Ruoholahti, because many people tear the leaf pieces of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to biowaste from the store.
According to the news published by the household messages, sniffing at a vegetable counter is a surprise to merchants.
But how much does removing extra vegetable parts before weighing actually save money?
How important is the sniffing technique really at stake?
We women tested how the price changes when the leaves or heels are taken away from pineapple, top artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower paying EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80, after it peeled all the leaves away.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple paying EUR 2,30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock was twisted away.
Globe artichoke: EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Delicious mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost 75 cents in total.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: The average broccoli cost EUR 1 and no stock 80 cents.
Final result: If the leaves and strains start to rip off, save a few cents at best for one vegetable.
In terms of percentages, the cost of vegetables fell by as much as 20 per cent.
This would have saved a total of EUR 1.20 from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a Brazilian star signed a five-year contract with the PSG
Brazilian Star Neymar has signed a five - year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a EUR 222 million buy-out price to FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish league.
The largest transfer amount of EUR 222 million is reported in football history.
Previously the record was on Manchester United, which cost EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League held back the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar’s first payment attempt.
According to the rules of the League, the purchasing company cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his own contract, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who provided the money through the League to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to a possibly new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uepha examines the details
Barcelona also announced in its press release that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Federation Uefa in order to enable the Federation to determine possible disciplinary action in this case.
For example, Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, has suspected that the PSG is violating Uefa's financial fair play rules by using its money.
Uefa can punish a company that makes more than EUR 30 million in losses over a three-year period.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its financial policy.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial amounts of money, Uepha was informed.
PSG is owned by a state-owned Qatari company called Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by Nasser al-Khelaif, a former tennis pro.

Austin, 21, was severely burned by lightning, and the flash was recorded on the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing regular work on an airplane at the Lunch Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when suddenly lightning from the rainy sky hit the plane.
The power of lightning threw the plane's wing into Dunn's ground.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said my brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I'm just asking if he's alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a brain hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You don't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to an airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on-line at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72% when it launched the new restructuring programme in response to the pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that he would cut costs again by GBP 300 million in May as part of his third savings programme, aimed at revitalising the business weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would maintain its outlook for the year, which increased its turnover by one per cent in the first half of the year and amounted to GBP 2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: a NATO soldier was killed in a suicide attack
The suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and the authorities say that a NATO soldier was killed and several others were wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the region of Qarabagh in Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "personalized explosive device".
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and were treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the Correspondents, the strengthening of Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area mainly populated by Shia Muslims.
Taliban reported that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in the centre of Kabul during the bombing, which was the most devastating attack by the country's militant group after the US-led troops took over Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send additional troops to help the local army and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul over the last few weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA turns around its decision to postpone the implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rotated its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog emissions taken during Obama’s administration the day after 15 states had sued the Agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "Otonimisations" of 2015 late on Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, is a sign of its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said Director Scott Pruitt in his statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Agency to postpone the implementation of the ozone definitions by one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, the Office sued 15 predominantly democratic states, including the District of Columbia, which claimed that it was illegal to postpone execution.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama's day, which, according to Trump, are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The measures taken by Mr Trump have been opposed by the democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhalation of ozone-containing air "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in Isis had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to the suspicions, the bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us exactly why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas discharge device and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Associate Commissioner Michael Phelan of the Australian Federation says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
Neste Managing Director: Renewable fuels did well
Oil processor Liquid's profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made a good profit in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products reached a record level and the development of the marketing & services segment’s operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, said Lievonen in the press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomarchenko are discussing a possible match at their first meeting.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series weighing less than 66.7 kg, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN Sports Channel facilities in Los Angeles until the WBC’s unbeatable lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomaschenko, the WBO’s top featherweight champion.
Garcia won the show on Saturday with the unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. Since then Garcia and Lomaschenko have been among the top five weight class boxers on the comparative list.
Garcia put out his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomarchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven on Saturday.
When the two posed to photographers, Lomaschenko’s manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that a man-to-man match would be “perfect in terms of size”.
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded me of.
"I moved the series higher than [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight.
He's got to get up on the lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomarchenko agreed.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the match should be organised on a pay-per-view channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomaschenko, according to which Lomaschenko will debut in a lightweight series later this year and fight Garcia next summer (37–0, 30 knockouts). Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight Forum on 23 September.
"The match could be on the pay-per-view because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
As soon as we get a deal, I'm cool with it."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "unbelievable fighter" and that he might be going to see Saturday's game.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's lair and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow." Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout.
Garcia said he was focused on showing the power of impact and then boxing.
The men said they felt that they wanted the fight between them to take place more and more.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this," Garcia said.
Lomarchenko said he was waiting to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average wage 5 300 euros, training whatever - the investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been talking a lot lately.
The last time Helsingin Sanomat told about Ritva, 68 to whom the banker’s investment advisor spoke total nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and various sales of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new MiFID, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define competence requirements.
The Financial Services (FA) itself recommends that those working in an investment firm complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV investment degrees Oy, whose qualification team consists of experts from both the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Ltd.
Its website says that in general both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV Investment Studies Ltd, says that the pass rate of the exams is roughly 70 per cent.
Of the staff of the largest banks, approximately all providers of investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2 because they are mandatory under the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers’ shops without mentioning names that seem to have been avoided by their staff, says Savikko.
According to him, there are "some" of these bankers' shops.
According to Savikko, the APV1 degree has been completed since 2000 by 13 000-14 000 people and more demanding APV2 degrees recommended to investment advisors by around 3,000 people.
Some bankers consider a degree to be an advantage.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that a recommendation from the financial sector requires the completion of APV degrees, because it is then that knowledge related to the investment sector will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month on average, including commissions, benefits in kind and performance fees.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly wage earners are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working for jobs earn more than EUR 5 900 per month and women earn more than EUR 4 500.
On average, the tithe of the highest-earners earns about EUR 8,100.
The tithe of men who earn the most earns more than 9,000 euros a month or more, one-tenth of women who earn the most earn 6 400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Until now, self-regulation has been relied on at the level of employees and tasks.
According to Fiva, its audit met individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient on the basis of the advice.
In principle, even with a low level of professionalism and competence, the seller of investment products can also act as a seller.
In principle, the situation has been wild and free in this respect.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements," says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up by the new MiFID II directive.
It requires that each undertaking is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
Financial supervision, for its part, will probably have the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, the market supervisor of Fiva, explains that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the regulation on requirements for the competence and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to investment firms' own staff and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court says that according to a government proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva should be given the authority to determine competence and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided with these prospects during the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty of proof that this has also been done.
The Court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the staff's job descriptions at individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the Court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not exactly meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the Court, with the change, the rules become stricter and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "took" a giant plane over the U.S.
The flight route was drawn over the United States in Flightradar24's service.
The flight was conducted on Thursday 787 with Dreamliner, which was used by Boeing to test the durability of the aircraft’s Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
In 18 hours and 1 minute, a plane from Seattle flew a distance of 15,700 km, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in use in the world.
The flight stayed within the borders of the United States all the way.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra’s persistent beach swimming school students are not moved by the rain or the sun’s roasting – Iines Kaikkonen was persistently treading with the help of a swimming pool
Iines Kaikkonen progressed well, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra's beach swimming schools are on Sludge and Lempuka for this and next week.
Even though it rains sometimes and then shines again, the young swimmers are not in trouble, says swimming school leader Taina Itkonen.
In this week’s swimming schools a total of 13 children increase their swimming skills, or about a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that school and eskari already start at that time, says Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organized by the Sports Unit project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach in Slute had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimming school students were training to stay on the surface with the swim owls, someone without them.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Lines of the Kaikko, 5, first thought of going deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged her to pedal toward the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me he had been swimming a lot this summer.
She thinks the silt beach is good.
Like Liines Kaikkonen, the swimhouse was a persistent swim exercise with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with today’s achievements, the swimming instructor praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, again, wanted to go to the water war.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg’s 6 swimming on the beach, regards the beach swimming school as a good start for learning how to swim.
No matter what the weather's been, Anna's been happy to come here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming school kids packed up on the pier.
The boys had a lot of work to do with the frog they found on the beach.
Billion Luukonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the dock, snacked on fruit and baked the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no hurry at the pier.
The kind that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes, "Here's a story that connects you."
You see all kinds of things.
A couple of days ago, the Blue Product, which manufactures cleaning products, launched the Unknown Military product series.
I mean, dish brushes, laundry gear, and a toilet brush on the side of the brush.
The unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of his premiere in the fall.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been detested in social media: When will the Unknown health bonds come?
I have to call the company and see what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of Blue Product, say?
We're partners in the film.
We're here to support this film, like a lot of other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film," Määttä says.
According to him, the products will be exhibited in a special way, and the film will thus be visible.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that products and stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products," Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other partners in the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, Hartwall's vichyt has been introduced to the market, including Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products already worked as a blogist for Suomen Kuvalehti Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still to be an extension.
For example, Valio, the breeder, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes, have not yet revealed their war products.
New results of age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were published
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of the tests carried out with the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years old, but not everyone believes that the tests are reliable.
The Swedish National Agency for Legal Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The tests will allow a more accurate assessment of the age of the asylum seeker, which was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for having failed to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6,880 tests so far, and the Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty per cent of the tests, i.e. 2002 were determined to be over 18 years of age, and in 25 cases, the Agency determined that the test was “possibly 18 years of age or older”.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years of age".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Agency for Legal Medicine says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no large differences in the statistics of previous months," he told The Local.
Although the majority of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that they have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that 442 cases had "referencing that the subject was 18 years old or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of the wisdom teeth and MRIs of the knee joints, then the images are analyzed by dentists and radiologists, and has also been criticised.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, the Endocrinologist of the Karolinic Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans, to determine whether a person has become a teenager earlier than usual or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not sure how old we are, we should not pretend that we can do it," he said to Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Agency for Legal Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "You can generally say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old, at which point the risk will be about 10%."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five more than par scores in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen's section 30 with a result slide down in the European golf tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left for Saturday day at 11th, but was found at the end of the tour to divide 41.
In difficult weather for Joy, there was a double-bog of three bogs.
Others had a hard time, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, stood up to share the top position of one under the par round, even though he said that the umbrella had enough work to do.
The reel was raw, but I was hanging along and eventually the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top position with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Andrew Dodt of Australia.
Governor of West Virginia changes party
On Thursday night, at Trump’s campaign event, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would change parties.
"Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection... today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The crowd burst into applause.
"Tomorrow as a registered Republican Party", Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes says he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1,59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement saying that 'Governor Justice's party change is yet another blow to a democratic party that would rather be building barriers than a better America'.
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership of any kind and cannot find a positive message that unites people," said Ronna McDaniel, a representative of the RNC, in her statement to CBS news.
The lightnings have sown the damage - Thursday becomes even the most thunderous day of the summer
At the end of the week more thunderstorms will also be available in Southern Finland.
During the past week, there has been a thunderstorm, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning struck several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday may be the most thunderous day of the summer so far.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has been in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
On the poo, lightning struck the electric center of a terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report of the fire about 15 minutes before midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located in the sauna room at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department unloaded the roof and wall to find the firehouses and quickly extinguished the fire.
Eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
On the other hand, lightning set fire to the outside building at Harjuland before midnight.
By the time the rescue services arrived, the building was already at full fire, and the rescue department could only prevent the fire from spreading.
An outbuilding about 50 square feet [50 sq m] was burned to the ground.
In Rääkkylä, towards Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue department was there to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't cause a fire - only a few fuses were fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train tracks between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the defect was received on Thursday morning between 8 and 9 p.m., after which the trains were replaced by buses.
It was not until just before five in the afternoon that the problem was resolved.
Since then, the train traffic has also normally continued along the thunder-cracked section of the track.
The lightnings have caused destruction in various parts of Finland.
This summer, however, has been relatively low.
These thunderstorms this summer have been a total disaster!
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of the summer, many feel even strong.
This might seem like a really tough thunderstorm, but that's what it's been like this summer's thunders," says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the paint lightnings blinked 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential even for the hardest thunder of the summer: by about 4 p.m. there were 1,790 earth lightnings.
If the lightning continues to the early evening, then more than two thousand lightnings can be achieved, Tuovinen is predicted.
The previous record-weak thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightnings of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year’s lightning volume had risen to 18,386 lightnings.
So there is still something to catch so that this year does not break the "state record" two years ago.
But the thunderskin can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and moist during the rest of the week, which is a natural environment favourable to thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunderstorms is likely to be on Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
There's going to be a more uniform rain front in the middle of the country.
According to Tuovinen, there's only a few thunderstorms.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
The world’s athletic boss, Sebastian Coe, praised his open-minded apology to Russia for the doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to put an end to Russia’s ban on participation.
The Russian athletic leader, Dmitri Shljahtin, said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday on the eve of the World Cup that the Russian ban is appropriate and that he is determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were taken away from the gold or silver medals in the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of continuing the ban. Russia was excluded from athletic competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report had provided evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct. It was very open-minded," IAAF President Coe told the journalists.
"The whole Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Association for Athletics acknowledged that the country had been going through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to reorganise its activities."
Mr Coe also said that he was "satisfying" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for lifting the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Group's recommendation that now is not the time to stop the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we will have to do everything in our power to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of a neutral athlete at the World Championships for Athletics in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
On Monday, Rune Andersen, Head of the IAAF Task Force, said that Russia still needs to meet a number of requirements before its status can be restored.
"The testing is still insufficient and the banned coaches remain free," he told journalists on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed with the weak success of Tom of Finland
The Tom of Finland film did not become the success the authors hoped for, says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed, confessing that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff Yle, CEO of Helsinki Film.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June it had reached more than 100 000 viewers, which is little compared to the budget of the film, about EUR 5 million.
This didn't turn out to be a lottery win, but now it's important that the investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in Finland, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign distribution," Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar’s transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from transferring from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, France, which is the most expensive player transfer ever made in football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by the UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair play economic rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the closure of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar’s annual salary for the new company moves in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic considerations.
The PSG will have no difficulty paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to its star guard, as the company will finance the dynasty of Qatar's oil-rich dynasty.
The clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they must be balanced by real revenue sources in order to avoid loss-making football-related business.
The financial rules for fair play were drawn up at the initiative of Michel Platini, a Frenchman elected President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success through debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play economic rules shifted from the debts of clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums of money on player acquisitions and created a worldwide brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of fair play economic rules will run until 2018. During this period, clubs will be allowed to make losses of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave the UEFA president's duties in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of the clubs.
"The rules for fair play are still in place and we will apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for fair play financial rules in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it may amortise the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has entered into a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recognised as a EUR 44.4 million annual expense over the next five years.
On the basis of fair play economic rules, the first sanctions were imposed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which was financed by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League team to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies linked to the club’s owners.
For example, if a company in Qatar supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA does not calculate the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the aid to PSG from the Qatar Tourism Authority was excessive.
It has also become clear that part of Neymar’s earnings in the PSG could be financed by the fees available to the Organisational Committee for the 2022 Football World Cup.
However, the PSG and the Organising Commission have prohibited Neymar from becoming an ambassador to the World Cup competitions. UEFA would be very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
As a result of the previous sanctions imposed by the PSG, UEFA will follow the rules even more closely than usual.
On Thursday, well-informed sources reported that UEFA did not negotiate a transfer of Neymar with PSG.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they are not authorised to discuss the situation in the PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit exceeded EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of companion products and jerseys.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish League, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the world’s best players, tried to make Neymar’s move more difficult, allegedly violating the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic case of doping, both for the club and for the state," said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish newspaper AS, who referred to the qatarian ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal’s manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state’s funding of the football club’s activities. Arsenal is owned by an American sportsman.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Anything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of a fair game. There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now we have to hurry: Finnish World Championships coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three defector Kristiina Mäkelä’s coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should coach athletics at the World Cup in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump qualifier and Mäkelä on Saturday in the three-loop qualifier.
However, the two - coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter on a major British mission without success.
The coach has an invitation from World Cup organizers as a documentary, but it has not been enough to get a visa either.
I wonder if this is one of Brexit’s first symptoms, or what, Coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always successfully handled visa matters himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't mean that much.
As long as someone at the stadium looks at the steps, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach might be missing.
The World Cup Medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
Athletics World Championships will begin in London today on Friday and will last for a week and a week ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and hockey are the kind of sports that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether it comes with success or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other gauges.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one high-value race to another, where by acquiring experience, the athlete’s performance will be matured to the level that the adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Now there are no such young athletes on the small Finnish World Cup team, although there are no co-conkarts.
It's gonna take a miracle to win the World Cup medal for Finland.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports is that miracles can occur.
It pulls bench athletes to the TV screen and glues them to the competitions, even though the London medals are not solved until late in the evening because of the time difference.
Finland received one bronze medal from the previous World Championships in Athletics 2015.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
Daggers expect a medal from Pitkämäki even now, even though the results of his and other shooters and Pitkämäki’s stay in the prize competition last summer tell the other story.
No matter what happens in these games, Pitkämäki will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, getting to the finals or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and belief in the realistic medal hunt for Finnish athletics in the years to come will be a good success in the international championships of young people this summer.
Processing young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small group of elite athletes.
Success does not come in the moment but requires years of sweaty work for athletes and patience for both training and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Let us hope that the London Games will end up in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah's Games, not because of terrorist intimidation or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi, second in Copper's big air, "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in the big air race in Colorado, U.S.A.
Copper Mountain's second place is Rukajärvi's best big oar in the world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
With his last jump, he tried cabalerial 1080 for the first time in the games, and it was very close to success.
I feel good and I feel good now, but I'm really sorry that the last jump didn't go quite well.
From now on, I'm going to try again in the race, thought Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, a competitor jumps out of a jumper made for the sport.
Viking Line’s new express ship stalled in Helsinki
The new Viking express ship FSTR is very late on schedule.
The express ship had to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There was a loading operation on the ship about eight o'clock.
The ship was already late in Helsinki.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get aboard.
Now the car queue is moving a little, the Estonian man waiting to be boarded at the port of Helsinki, Johannes Rebane, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there was a technical malfunction on the new ship.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had brought in water bottles waiting in their cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund says to IS that there's been a technical malfunction.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late for Tallinn's return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn to return to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.

Small circle nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story marvels both at the days of character glory in the '80s and at the grunge of the '90s (in those days, David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant series of The State sketches for MTV) and at their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things.
As a cultural product, it is both parody and a description of the constant memory that we are stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived for a while.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (which, among other things, was described as the background story of the vegetable can with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The essence of the joke is that middle-aged actors act like horny teenagers approaching the age of adulthood, and highlighting it makes the impossible to reach the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodys 90s stalker movies, such as horror movies Hand that rockes the cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still not over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there is a crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his accomplice, George H. W. Bush (who is aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in a series like this, the best are the side paths.
It's especially fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd, who has a bearded beard under his lower lip from the "soul patch" of Matt Dillon's movie Singles.
The moments of random madness may raise this series to flight as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a group of friends will go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series appeals to another kind of nostalgia: The American’s Cold War Spirit, Atomic Blonde and even the GLOW series, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, where a Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism.
The starring Gregor and idealistic Iosefina are seen as Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici. Their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's all it is.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (police spends time watching chess on television in the same way that Americans watch football).
There's a bunch of famous vocalists, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is caught too much in imitation of a clumsy socialist drama – a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, for example. That is why the show often starts to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is neither quick nor plentiful.
In summary, the series might work better as a Agitprop satir, for example, when Gregor and Iosef visit the American Embassy repeatedly and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary Communist public is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and their history.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola will be in the ring in Macao on Saturday against a former UFC fighter.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macau, as Leandro Issa from Brazil still fought in the UFC organisation last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of jujutsu and the world championship of the sport.
For once in my life, I'm fighting an older man.
It's funny, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvolan was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were brought on a quick schedule in the Chinese Autonomous Community of Macao.
Tauru's never encountered anything like that before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It annoyed me because it took a lot of time to get ready and practice.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date has been set for the struggle.
Waiting a week doesn't have much to do with preparation.
The transfer won't affect the condition, because it won't improve in a week.
It can get worse if you practice too much.
In the last few struggles Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in standing up.
This time it's different.
The Issaa Kouvolan describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he's gonna come in the first round hard and try to take it to the rug.
He's won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The last fight in Kouvola didn't go as planned.
The Philippine Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the corner of the eye, leaving victory to the Philippines.
I've never fought so well in my life, especially when he was standing. He never got a hit.
When I went down there, he hit me in the corner of my eye.
I was really upset about that for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some get in the ring more frequently.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now we are facing the second struggle of this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
In recent years, I have been working out and in good shape the whole time.
But the only reason I've ever fought is because I'm fighting.
When a 32-year-old found out about a future encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was in Espoo training and got the joy of doing it back.
We got some really good practice when we had this guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, for on Saturday the Kouvolan will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical fight.
It's the 32-year-old's main tactic of standing up.
You have to hit me with a straight shot.
If there's a chance, I'll go myself.
You can't give down-flows for free, because they're the ones that consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who fought in China before.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and great evening ahead of us.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been unsettled and inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the bank moved interest rates because of the increasing pressure on family incomes.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided, by 6 to 2, to keep interest rates at 0.25%, which this month gained less support because of the lack of economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank decreased its growth forecast to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6 per cent. It also warned that household income is under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate by close to three per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rate increases will be needed in the coming years to curb inflation boosted by Brexit, and the Bank announced that loan costs could have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide preferential financing to banks in the form of a total of GBP 15 million, i.e. 115 million.
The report on the Bank's interest rate decision states: "According to the Financial Policy Commission forecast, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as the decline in households' real income decreases consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" in order to curb inflation "a little wider than the market's expectations".
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the possible increases are "scale" and "limited".
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The weight weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 per cent, amounting to $1.31, which weakened by 0.4 per cent compared to the euro and amounted to EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after weaker than expected growth rates were dampened by increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and the bank says that the situation will deteriorate even before it improves.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" falling income over the next few years, but expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will reverse some of the effects of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% after the shock of the EU referendum, which led to a fall in the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will probably not be reflected in prices and the economy until four years later.
Prior to the recent decision of the Central Bank, the demand for interest rate increases had become ever louder as inflation tightened the pressure on households, and three decision-makers demanded a 0.5% interest rate increase in July.
Inflation eased last month to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the bank, it was expected and inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess of its 2% target was 'all' due to a weak pound.
"In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the competition in the mortgage market seems to become even more intense as creditors frantically seek customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is ending; renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also unused alternatives."
NHS prescribes 10 000 controversial anti-HIV medicines
As of September, patients can be prescribed a "returnable" anti-HIV medicine, and the dispute over the funding of the medicine in the UK public health system (NHS) was concluded in the Supreme Court.
NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial. Prior to sexual intercourse, a drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld last year’s Supreme Court ruling, which states that NHS is able to pay for the PrEP medicine, even though it claims that it should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, director of NHS England, called the decision announced on Thursday "significant new intervention", and the national AIDS organization described it as "a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to accept registrations for an experiment that will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be taken before intercourse with an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
A medicine to be taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during sexual intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
You can take it every day or two hours before you have sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders as well as people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics select candidates who qualify for the trial from men, women and transgenders as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for his or her disease.
People living in England and registered for general medical treatment can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million, and this week the UK NHS signed a contract for medicines after an international call for tenders.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, uptake and implementation.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the existing diverse and more effective ways of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"It's yet another major achievement in the struggle for more than 30 years to solve one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV", says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is applied correctly to those who need it and to those at risk, it may have a revolutionary effect on the British HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, those at risk will receive a medicine that will be used independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, through a test funded by NHS, and will have a empowering effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one in the risk group is excluded," says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP medicine used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The launch of the PREP experiment is a welcome event, which has been delayed in vain for several months due to the slowness of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the Shadow Government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a revolutionary effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get one step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of life: the interlayer and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker enthusiastic about the renovation of properties, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house like Queen Anna's, and the success of the renovation is that Joanne has not yet packed her things and moved.
"I used to live with my ex in a much bigger apartment in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here to the apartment screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as my apartment back then.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer on the same day."
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed Design Agency in Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to take advantage of the space of nearly four meters high and to create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an interlayer where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The structures are quite complex.
The farms had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to squat in them.
The structures had to be modified in such a way that the height is just right on top and under."
Erfan was able to place two full - high rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the middle floor opens the copper-crossed window of Retrouvius in an elegant lounge.
Mirror-gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage luminaires create a distinctive style.
Using mirrors brings theatricality, space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than real.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window overlooking another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
It adds to the style that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But Joanne’s kitchen is unique because the door is raised up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about a steel-strengthed MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it slides very easily when you put it in place."
With rational space use and storage planning, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and a better floor solution.
"When the dwelling is sold, the area determines – or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"Basically, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The dwelling is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the emotional bond to the dwelling is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one gets attached to electrical wires in the walls.
They're important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and extra squares can make the basic dwelling exceptionally fine.
Then it may also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's costume choice hit the fan.
Princess Sofia represented in Båstad, Sweden for the last time before she was born.
For dinner at the A Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia represented the event with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad of Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue body-to-body outfit that dressed a beautifully pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event in which Sofia will represent before her birth.
His due time is in September.
For dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style was crowned by big earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue did a great job on the princess.
Sofia has been to Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia filled out her costume with a little bag.
Sofia was radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited at the event to talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said, laughing and referring to her last pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a booth appeared in Lahti market where Thai food was sold.
The Bayians didn't dare taste it, they walked by.
In the booth, Panya Suamsri-Penttilä sold food, among the people who knew Panja.
He did not know much about Finnish, nor did the Finns yet know Thai at the time.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
Thus he taught the Bayers to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste the land, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai cafeteria in Lahti.
There were two small tables. I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and have limited seats, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
Little by little, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat by the plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by at the mall, but then the restaurant had to move, because they said that the spices made themselves smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was opened at the end of the trading hall.
There's room.
Now we instillers are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times we have to shyly ask our guests if there is room next to them.
Panja knows her clients.
He'll be told what he's been up to and who he's seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the food club changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring roll.
She remembers me when I was skinny and fat, and she remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and catch up with Panja, who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened our minds and hearts.
Today, many talk to him about thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
He goes to restaurant work in mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any alarm or attention, it was this remarkable day, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, security authorities received an important list of measures to combat terrorism.
The list contains the data of more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 persons and the document includes not only their personal data but also pictures of each person.
There are over 130 Iraqis on the list, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have been revised.
According to the newspaper, special forces in the Iraqi army found a list of terrorist identities and images while investigating an underground terrorist organization base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities evaluated the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
There's also a list of terrorist specialties.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to Syria to join the ISIS ranks.
A suicide bomber has been written on the side of his picture.
There's no more detailed information on the man's fate.
In total, around 6 000 fighters have entered the ranks of Isis from Europe, whose fate is uncertain.
The man sank below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to interviews with the rescue services, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, the Tokoinranta of Helsinki saved a person under water.
According to Ville Estlander, the fire engineer at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the report.
The rescue services diver found him under the surface, says Estlander.
The rescue department received a report after 3:30 in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the paramedics.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander commends the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The divers were also excellently guided by those present.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars collided with nine people in Eura cars, three seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered less injuries, says the on-call fire engineer.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads around four o'clock in the day.
The accident occurred when the second car turned behind the warning triangle in front of the other car, says the on-call fire engineer.
According to the rescue services, there's a 50-mile-an-hour speed limit at the intersection.
The brothers are fighting over $500 million in real estate.
Two brothers are arguing over Victoria’s largest real estate empire, worth more than $500 million, a dispute related to the family business that their Italian family set up 40 years ago.
Former chairman of Carlton’s football club and property developer Colin De Lutis lives in Toorak’s rank area only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the dispute over the division of property and business assets between brothers to the Supreme Court.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, together own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate property when they bought a shop on Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
That's where the family started the Westco Jeans store, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for 85 million dollars in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centers.
According to an agreement with the deceased father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the father's carrying power and central figure".
According to the court records, the division of assets means Colin owns real estate worth about $316 million and Paul owns some $176 million.
Paul's not happy with the real estate and the money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was dealt with for the first time in the Supreme Court after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says that this is not true, that he blames Paul for the mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to find a solution.
"In line with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me," says Colin in his statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails and reports to investigate consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as one of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started a shop "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons in harmony.
"Luigi often said he didn't want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business, and Colin says Mark got $10 million and Luke 26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "curious with the financial terms of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is a former member of the Australian Football League Society’s Board of Directors and best friend of TV star Eddie McGuire according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who answered, and he said in his text that he couldn't really comment on it, because it's being discussed in a court of law.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw the name of our family into a court battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin said and said that he still hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, the hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is going to restrict the President's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House Chief of Staff is going to restrict the media use of President Trump and the monitoring of the news so that the boss does not get in trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawson reported:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with the management staff on his first day of work, he raised a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to restrict the information of President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the employees of the White House that all the information – printed as well as those heard at the press conferences – must go through him because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relations with television — and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"If President-designate Trump was nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media dealt with matters more fairly," said Sam Nuenberg, who worked as an advisor in Trump's campaign, to Politico in February.
At the time, Politico’s journalist Tara Palmeri wrote that “according to six former campaign workers, it is essential to manage Trump’s use of Twitter that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of praise”.
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's use of Twitter was ever under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us do not know – perhaps without their efforts, Trump’s tweets would have been even more intense.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump didn't send.
If even a few times his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing commotion.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are rival groups in the White House who are trying to pursue their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their view. That information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisors deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
A reporter named Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can be extremely enraged by newspaper clippings that criticize him – especially if they tell about harmful leaks of information – and then he is absolutely obliged to know where the information comes from.
That happened at the end of February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news from GotNews.com, set up by Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and later withdrawn them, and he did not provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started the case after reading the article, asking the staff about Walsh."
Mr Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Mr Rob Porter, Secretary of Staff of the White House, 'had tried to introduce a system of managing documents for Trump'.
And what was the result again?
That's what Kelly's trying to do three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump remains his own impulsive self and his assistants continue to pursue their own affairs.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with the PSG.
Brazilian Star Neymar has signed a five - year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a EUR 222 million buy-out price to FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish league.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona was therefore dissolved and he was free to move to the Parisian Society of PSG.
The largest transfer amount of EUR 222 million is reported in football history.
Previously the record was on Manchester United, which cost EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by a state-owned Qatari company called Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by Nasser al-Khelaif, a former tennis pro.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
"I'm in the best shape of my life" was the hypnosis of alcoholism and fear of flying.
From the TV series The time of the Rose and the Clean White Sheets known as the success writer Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren gave up Spain’s sun and Fuengirola’s apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring there was also a rental dwelling.
In the light and the sun, out of the old circles, Rajian was once driven by depression and alcoholism, which he survived.
Even the external essence is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went off when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood drugs.
Alcoholism once helped me with hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, and I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been traveling together for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the tourism industry, have been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
She has always been such a drama queen, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen, who has made a great career as a writer, remembers only a good 44-part clean white sheets of TV that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I decided once and for all to work for the fresh family company in the clothing industry when I read Alice Seppälä's 50th-year interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of the seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes I was a mannequin," Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it," Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer of active time, she has many manuscripts working on - ideas for hundreds.
The Travellers returned across the ditch to the "Millionaire alley"
One of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands is once again hair-sucking with tenacious hikers who managed to cross the ditch that the municipality needed and return to the field next to the houses.
The circuitists parked about 20 caravans near a street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed for the procession, bringing children, horses and the army of vans.
The circuitists managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Infuriated residents have accused Solihull's municipality of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident tells us that on Monday night the vagrants came from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passersby.
"The municipality needs to be tough on action because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Travellers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them last night and probably even more today."
The resident reported that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by refusing access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the Travellers returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they've even landed a horse grazing in the park."
According to the spokesman of Solihull Municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
As far as the gathering of evidence is concerned, it is very important that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for the trial."
Infuriated people surrounded Portugal's crash machine.
In Portugal, forced landing men have been questioned today in court.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
Two men flying a plane could be charged with manslaughter.
You can get 16 years in prison in Portugal at the longest.
Yesterday, a small plane flown by men had to crash on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon because of a technical defect.
At the time, there were hundreds of people on the beach, some of whom ran from the landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane landed on a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
Immediately after that the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, telling the newspaper Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who got killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents weren't hurt.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane right after the crash, angry.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and started beating its ass, reported Celia Rocha Correio da Manha, who witnessed the incident.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the crash landing.
The tragically lost Finnish star of his leg once again won the World Cup gold: "If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't be the world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finnish time early Wednesday morning in the tournament held in Big White, Canada.
Grand Hamari won the World Cup earlier in the games.
All in all, three World Championships have already accumulated.
It's a pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice treated with gold, with a pretty good heart rate pulled, the telephone reached Greater Hamari rejoiced.
A 30-year-old calculator commended his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Great Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing.
The whole paralum boarding has grown and developed so much lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming out of the back.
There seems to be a different winner in every race.
Grand Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From a young age, he had been zealously counting with his friends, and the accident did not take away the desire to enter the slope.
It reminds me of what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there's no point in saying that.
The cards are used to play what has been distributed, the Grand Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to label a serious accident and lose a limb as a lucky break, and the Great Hamari will not do it.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
I'd say it turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar’s biggest surfing enthusiasm was already waning.
It wasn't until after the accident that the job went to the top.
When I was a kid, I was training with guys, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow at the X-Games Star.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to get bitter and sad.
I decided to put on the overalls and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The counter was very pleased to have chosen Leo-Pekka the Star of the Year as an athlete.
The four - time Olympic winner won his prize at the sports gala held in January.
Great Hamar says the Star's victory is an important signal to the parasports.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the parasport world.
When is it time to launch the second world champion Matti Suur-Hamar's Year of Sports?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari hasn't conquered all the peaks he's coveted yet.
Next year there will be a great goal.
In a year's time, the Paralympics will be in South Korea.
We'll go out there and get a medal!
A majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees studied the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen to allow them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen to bring about a change in the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller Communications Agency chain explained the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the views and attitudes of Arab youths for nine years now.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February to March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youths aged 18 to 24 responded to the survey, of which half are women and half are men.
Half the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their country of origin permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of the respondents may think they are going back to their country of origin and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, young people’s decision to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor for a permanent return home, while a quarter of them believe that the most important thing would be for ISIS to leave the country.
Only less than a tenth of the key factors in the decision are the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
The Syrian youth were asked which factor is the most important for the resolution of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the surrender of President Bashar al-Assad.
A quarter or so of Al-Assad sees the president of Al-Assad as an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to bring an end to the current Syrian conflict.
Only about a quarter of people believe in resolving the conflict with mere military action.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see the weakening of the power of ISIS over the past year, while the fifth feels that it has strengthened its power.
According to the respondents, the most important part of the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media should inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many raised military measures and training reform as a priority.
In the opinion of just over a tenth, the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asking about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believe that the Syrian conflict will worsen during the Trump era.
Opinions are divided as to whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoded to keep the Internet in order - the database he developed is used by Wikipedi and Google, for example.
MariaDB, a company from Espoo, is developing the “fastest growing” open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by the coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, is not costing users anything, and it can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
Google and Wikipedia, for example, are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses will be kept in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the head of technology at MariaDB, spends about half his time encoded.
A man who works remotely from Kauniainen helps to make sure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and one year later the software giant Oracle devoured Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced that they would leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a sure promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company at this stage to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired about 20 top developers from Sun to make sure that the continuity of the code is secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
A foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"During the MySQL, these verifications were not made", Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar deal, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"For the past few years, our growth rate has been about 50% a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, MariaDB's CFO.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is scarce in the company's key figures.
He reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive EUR 20 million worth of orders.
As the database is free of charge, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year’s work if the customer has used a closed database.
From MySQL to MariaDB can be exchanged overnight because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia, DBS, are the paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks", Paqvalé says.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Oraclelle MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although, according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast growing sinters.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases do not even reach one billion.
However, the value of open source can not be measured only in money, since most users pay nothing for these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70 per cent of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been switched to open databases or at least the transition would have started.
Large companies do not get new customers, because the majority of them will choose an open source code next.
This has led to the capping of licence fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers," Widenius says.
Since changing a closed database is difficult, the majority of customer companies have swallowed price increases obediently.
"There are a lot of customers who find it really difficult to move because their old applications and others are in a closed database," Widenius says.
But he still believes that the customer's size is about to be full.
When licence fees rise every year, the customer will sooner or later transfer to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from before, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wishes.
Moreover, many companies are already facing major system changes when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for the financing of EIB was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros per year from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed by how money is spent in Finland on closed health care systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but in my opinion it is a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that you can't think of or can't do.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source promoters in addition to the second Finnish, Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on top of open source code.
I still hold 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy is intensifying its attitude towards civil society rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that their vessels will rescue refugees in the Mediterranean Sea that they will not continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If non-governmental organisations are not committed to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the German vessel of Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
For only a year, the relief organization refused to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area", the organisation announced in a statement published in the social media.
"We can only judge the charges once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet vessel since October.
It is suspected that the crew has taken on board several boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who regained access to the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres off the coast of Libya, as shown by the prosecution’s document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defied the Italian Coast Guard, who oversees rescue operations in the area, and the motive is the zeal for aid.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced on Thursday that they considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they did not entail "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refuse to follow the Code of Conduct are Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders.
Mr Minniti, on the other hand, pointed out that the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy as a result of rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, as he sees as evidence that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that there are plans to continue discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
The seasonal worker is suspected of being killed by his common-law partner at Enontekio, the suspect was found in the terrain - a case for the prosecutor
The suspect's crime took place in Enontekio's Kuttanen last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish common-law spouse.
It has been reported in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspect, after what he did, had fled with two dogs to the ground.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he didn't resist when he was captured.
We'll have to press charges in less than a week.
The case may be discussed at the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and all-haired friends of mine, is dead.
The British actor, Robert Hardy, died at 91.
On Thursday, his family announced the death of an actor.
Hardy, born in 1925, began his acting career at the theater at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is remembered in particular for the role of Minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in My All Hairy Friends TV series based on James Herriot’s book.
The BBC's popular series was shot for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for texts inciting suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in jail for text messages and phone calls that were considered to incite the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of manslaughter, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at the Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, listened to his judgment with his hands crossed with a crying look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by "disturbing circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level or even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions".
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, in which she said that "not a day goes by that I will not mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can handle all this. I will try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear.”
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that she was "haunted" by the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding and that she would never be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never stop," said Camdy.
There seems to be a precedent, since there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014.
This case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had induced his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Hurry yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was looking for attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of the experts.
Only a few have defended Carter, one of whom is Amanda Knox, 30, convicted of the murder of a British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion in which he says, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
Secretary-General of NATO: Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, comments Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia of this and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," said Stoltenberg in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russia's continued instability in the East Ukraine region has led to a significant deterioration in NATO's relationship with Russia.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, U.S. President Donald Trump found that the U.S.-Russia relationship was even at a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump urged that we thank the poor congress of the countries, which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update over 350,000 car software.
The president of BMW said that the company believes that 'there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the home of BMW, Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about recalling.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emission neutralizing devices will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Merkel has been accused of following the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's faults, and Volkswagen installed con equipment in cars that reduced the emissions to the regulatory requirements of the tests, and in normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of the Audi engine development department for thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emission requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the producer of luxury cars accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The vote in Venezuela started a fraud investigation, major demonstrations in the pipeline
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a company that has no role in the election results, the chairman of the National Election Commission, Tibisay Lucenan, said to journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
On Sunday, in Venezuela, a controversial vote was held in which the representative body was elected to change the country’s constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against it.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they will be in progress at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, on Wednesday evening, the national security forces began to take over the country’s parliament building.
They are intended to ensure the security of the appointment ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provence’s lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined because of drought and disease - bearing insects, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is almost endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years. As a result, the rainfall levels in spring and especially in autumn have decreased clearly," says Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Institute of Agriculture, Provence.
"This will shorten the lifetime of lavender.
In addition, drought has brought many small cascas into the area, spreading microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly desired ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"We now have smaller flowers, which are weakly developed or weakened or missing altogether, instead of long-running and large flowers," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by stepping up irrigation, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water.
The murder of a journalist reflects a growing threat in Mexico
A weekly edition of the Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how to deal with the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and an endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
However, today we are discussing security in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: leaving the children at home or including them in the delivery that was attacked by grenades in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking journalists to name names for each group, but there's no need for evidence, and there's enough evidence and knowledge.
Names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being on government or drug cartel payrolls are being written on the board, criminals who make Mexican chaos life-threatening.
According to the Journalist Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. In the past year, at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. It says "Justice". The thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a brand-new panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their mutual trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor’s office was set up to deal with cases of journalists in particular, but according to the Journalists’ Protection Committee, only two charges have been filed so far.
The murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice, as are few of the thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime every year.
Riodoce journalists are going to continue writing about violence in Sinaloa, even though they are saddened and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the safety conference is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why this happened."
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan on 15 May 2017.
He had been driving his red Toyota just a few blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left with a wife and two grown children to mourn.
Rumors move quickly and freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is silent.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competing factions want to fill the void.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death daily, and there are two - story tombs of drug barons that are larger than many homes.
The state of the coast is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damascus Lopez, who runs a rival group that is waging war on the Guzman boys.
The case might have pissed off the Guzman boys: customers suspected of being gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to sales outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another magazine published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when in 2003 he decided to set up five colleagues with Riodoce. The magazine's shares were then sold for $50.
In Sinaloa "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem", Bojorquez says.
As time passed, the magazine became familiar with its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for her news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the Journalist Protection Committee for his courage to follow the story of drug trafficking in Mexico without letup.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on," he said when he was awarded the Journalist Protection Committee.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The supplier must accept the task that falls upon him – or act foolish.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce’s staff miss Valdez — a joker who cursed like a port worker — a friend who always gave a hug and advice. They long for a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were the end of his life.
The death of a colleague has also caused them to wonder how they can best do their job and stay alive.
"The offenders will not like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their clean business, their secret drug trade runways.
They were left out of the story," Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-preservation,
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel like everything's not right, you have to stay away.
The problem is, according to Riodoce’s journalist Andres Villarreal, that “the impression can be deceiving, and that’s what happened in Javier’s case”.
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where riodoce’s safety training was conducted. A few days earlier it had become apparent that only government spyware had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter at 40 degrees Fahrenheit [40 ° C.] in the shade of the tree.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodoce premises in a four - story building in the middle - class Culiacan area.
Some journalists were half joking about whether these two policemen were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's delivery planned three main cases.
Boxing greatness Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s spending was concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block from the prosecution’s office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official record of who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The journalist found out in public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI), who has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place, one of which was the son of El Chapo Guzman who managed to escape and avoid the military raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez’s column would provide reliable information on the kidnapping.
"Previously we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed El Flaco because of his slim body structure.
"Now all communications with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been converted into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists are kept. The magazine’s employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press freedom activists.
A journalist named Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him the next morning when she left the local prosecutor’s office for a demonstration that was due to another journalist’s murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoaca three days after Valdez was murdered.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In protests on sidewalks and buildings, "SOS Press" texts appear.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez met with the Governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked for him to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, criminal law - permitting authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the command of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to Article 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a crippling effect.
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulipas border state six years ago.
At his body was a note signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my writing."
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border state following the murder of Miroslava Breaki in March.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on his front page to drug cartels: "What do you want with us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and we must be on guard at all times.
Sometimes criminals sought out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — once to become a poet — admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
"I became a reporter because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce’s reporters sat on the sidewalk at midnight on Friday morning on a beer when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly, their phones began to vibrate as a sign of the message.
In a shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people had died at the Mazatlan beach resort.
The war accelerated, as promised by the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters put the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The front page had to be rewritten the next day.
The sirens howled nearby — another shooting scene.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers guarding the delivery.
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoce’s delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where the man shows the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about shutting down the operation. "How could I stop the paper when our intern asked me to get out on the street to do a story the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "The tough spot"
In April, Hannu Manninen’s 39 - year - old party was short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen contracted the flu.
It started a long period of illness that lasted for almost five weeks.
May practically went away when I was sick.
At first there was the flu, and finally there was a childhood disease such as an ear infection that I had to take an antibiotic course.
I was only able to make the planned exercises 10%.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick.
It was tough when I couldn't take advantage of the training effort, Manninen tells the Evening Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The World Champion of 2007 was not authorised until the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU roller mat test conducted on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers on the carpet, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete’s fingertip with a needle.
Last fall I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
There's a wall coming up, Manninen says.
For the better
After the understatements, Manninen tells us that she's been healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to try to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now it's a really good five-week episode.
Midsummer also had a week and a half leave of flight duty.
My family and I have plenty of time to go to the cabin.
Last season Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Championships.
The best result was seen in the opening competition when Manninen went up on top skiing on the 18th.
Guidelines withdrawn
Manninen and the national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan up until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to last season.
After the first snow competition, Ruka would have a weekend of three world cup races.
In December the intention would be to be involved at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans should still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the Olympic team's list," Manninen says.
The Olympic Games in Pyeongchang would already be the sixth Winter Olympics in Manninen's career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummelian underscore that celebrated the gold team race in Salt Lake City in 2002.
The dinosaur sheltered himself from his enemies by disguise
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first results of research on a rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that scientists could even define that its scaly skin was reddish brown and had had a "problem of the past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved dinosaur of all time and one of the world’s best representatives of its species.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous Age 110-112 million years ago.
Researchers view this amazingly well preserved fossil as a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armored vegetarian is the best fossil ever preserved in his species.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and he decided to examine his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Palaeontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, for six years, the beast was dug out of a 1,100 - kilo block.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you squint, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It will remain in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The studies of the skin revealed that meat - eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had an armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red - and - white armor masked its predators and was also protected by darker and lighter coloring from the top, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to mix with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
A 110 million - year - old nodosaurus came to the headlines in May and is now on display at the Tyrrell Royal Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have named it Boreapelle after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, and Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine its body scales and armor patterns and shape.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by popular coloring, where the body is darker and lighter from the top.
However, this observation was a surprise because Boreape is considerably larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
It suggests that the dinosaurs who eat meat were preying on it to the point that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival instead of fighting.
For example, deer, zebras and armadillos have the same coloring of modern animals, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The hunt for a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Creed Age were," Brown says.
A chemical analysis of nodosaurus scales of organic compounds reveals that its leather was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the Nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including examining the contents of its intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted to the sea, where it sank to the bottom of the sea.
Alberta was as warm at the time as it is now in Florida, and rivers and oceans likely extended far beyond today.
"This nodosaurus is very significant because its scaly skin has survived and has also been preserved in its original three-dimensional form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as it did in the early Cretaceous Age.
It doesn't take much imagination to see it: if you squint a little bit, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The Creed Age was the era of terropods, huge bipeds, flesh - eating dinosaurs.
Though their king, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years before Boreapelta, his mighty predecessors may have been preying on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus Rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a six - ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, who believe that Boreape washed into the sea after its death and mummed into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best-preserved dinosaur, with skin and armor, from snout to hip.
The Nodosaurus averaged five meters [5 m] in length and weighed as much as 1,300 pounds [1,300 kg].
Two six - foot - long spikes were raised from their blades.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the present Western Canada until it was transported to the open sea by a flooded river.
Its armor has been preserved in small details in an underwater grave.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its skin remains in the dented plates of armor along its skull.
In fact, Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is “as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There's still fossilized leather on the bumpy plates of that skull armor.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales on that sole."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when she noticed a message from her high school friend:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old kid and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information in his feed. That’s why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police lock-up tapes and screaming people and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who was carrying a sign saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video footage of a police officer standing in front of protestors with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video of another cop rigging his rifle and screaming, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers that he did.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a flight home for the next day.
Ferrell picked up his six-year-old daughter at her father's house and decided they were going to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years has been made a documentary film "Whose Streets"? It was premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the point of view of the local people who went out on the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson in a flower dress and her daughter dressed in a crown compatible with it, they again had a conversation about "what it is like to live in black and in what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't leave her with me," Ferrell told me later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of what happened in the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and grow into it.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black, and he needs to know what we need to do to be freed, to free ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still like the rest of the black girls.
I feel that I would harm him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a campground for activists while they waited for information on the case and eventually found out that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protestors.
Ferrell gradually began to view activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he says. During his studies at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of a group of minority nursing students. At that time he focused on the right to food and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience of organization.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, an assistant director of the documentary.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to tell you" what was happening.
Ferrelli was suspicious, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story you can use?"
This suspicion was motivated by countless instances of the emergence of people in the local community, usually white, who simply wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no voice," Folayan said in an interview recently. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism among the prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis’ involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals, following events in the years following Brown’s shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing was how the local people are portrayed in the film because I'm being played in the same way."
According to Folayan, it was not intended to focus on Ferrell's experience because it was intended to show that the popular movement 'is not a charismatic leader but a community'.
That's why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells me what it felt like to see a movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human description of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell’s story times and re-emphasises the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to put up with everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, including many queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not selected for "self-intentional" purposes because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy going," Folayan says.
"But it's no coincidence that he was in the front line. Black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the relationship between the community and the police is still tense.
Ferrelli still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking the freeway in a demonstration.
His description of the social climate in his hometowns is brief and concise: "The mix-up."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he memorized three years ago on Ferguson's streets:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love each other and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains."
Suitable likeness: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman gallery in New York has hung a face in the middle of the exhibition space — white, black and brown faces, between which you can see more closely the resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he served his 35-year sentence, convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transcendent and groundbreaking dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama relaxed on the third last day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp but slightly theoretical statement on the customization of DNA data, ambiguities and the underlying cause-effect relationships and identity.
Chelsea Manning, named Bradley Edward, has openly identified herself with women since puberty. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including espionage violation, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, sentenced to prison: a granular, black and white selfie, in which bothered Manning sits in the car in the driver's seat. He wears a platinal wig that became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a very popular Strander Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
There he created portraits based on forensic data, DNA data from cigarette butts and gums, for example, and created images of what the people involved could have looked like.
Then the artist received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told us at an information conference for a new exhibition.
Manning was unable to visit and he could not be photographed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked her if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence buddies, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even wrote together the Suppressed Images comic book, which was depicted by Shoili Kanungo. It described a future in which the president would have reduced Chelsea’s sentence and allowed her to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning’s sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a fortunate coincidence after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump is waging his own war against information leaks and transgender soldiers and is still finding new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions that he was actually required to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose."
On the wall of the gallery is an artist's statement and below it is Manning's great signature, where the heart is the point of the last name i. In his opinion, the artist calls for an end to the "autonomous division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based".
There is a DNA sequence of Manning on the opposite wall: a long line of C, G and A letters written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as is the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are of equal value in our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there are 30 of them on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from the comic book Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
That's where Manning's character rises out of prison like King Kong with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can silence you, they'll have won," says the picture.
"Never shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get the chills."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he was greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a group of protestors in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, as is everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to make them feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind her release."
Professor of Northwestern University and a staff member of Oxford University are wanted for murder.
Police report that they launched national searches to find a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford university employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County court records show that on Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the records, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple lacerations on his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene, and the stabbing was investigated as a murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Nortwestern since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice-president of the University for Social Relations, stated in an e-mail that Lathem is now on administrative leave and is banned from accessing Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by the University and Somerville College's e-mail states that "we have been in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to assist the US investigation authorities in any way possible."
The opinion also stated that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Chicago Police Department, said that he is seriously urging suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly clarifying our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
He said that the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as horrifying.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Executive Committee published the following press release to the residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill the Muslims" in London.
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the convict said to the police.
Moffatt must complete 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted, among other things, of aggravated harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims.
Suspect left the store after the threats.
They caught Moffatt when he called the police about threatening him.
The threat had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore, the police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogation.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay £620 (about €690) legal costs and £85 (about €95) compensation for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's publicist, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete WADA road map activities in the near future" – Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, Russia
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Road Map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Part of the road map measures have already been taken and RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD of the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Road Map, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of the powers of RUSADA. The second part of the Road Map was recently published on the organisation’s website.
According to the Mutko, it contains nothing of concern to Russia.
"All things have been announced, and everything will be carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future", Mutko added.
One of the points on the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the findings of the investigation conducted by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, appointed by the WADA, who is investigating the alleged role of the State in the doping of Russian sport.
To that Mutko said: "The study is under way because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no national programmes, and we cannot admit something that did not exist."
Mutko's words contained echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the independent Russian Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian sports media earlier that day, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
The WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping in Russia in November 2015, when the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Mr Olivier Niggli, Director of WADA, visited the headquarters of RUSADA in Moscow, and he said that the organisation was on the right track towards the restoration of powers.
British organization skeptical about innovation dear to Finns: "There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity kits"
The British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity kits.
For example, BBC and Guardian report that Lullaby Trust, which fights against SIDS, prohibits the use of their own brochures in maternity packs distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity kits to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity kit reduces the risk of SIDS.
The death of a baby means the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert on health care in Britain in the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them because it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organisation informed.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as a small number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure," said the CEO of the Lullaby Trust, Francine Bates.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of items such as children's clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The box itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for sleeping if no cradle or cot is available.
The organization recommends that the packaging be used only for naps and stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and ensuring that it does not get wet or dirty.
The swift villain escaped from the Japanese zoo for the second time
The staff at the Japanese zoo are looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff at its speed and has run away twice in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okaya, Western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried about Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55 kilos and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to travel freely in the yard area.
The zoo hasn't been able to get an eyewitness to the turtle.
The last time the villain ran away, it happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help you avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her online shop start-up business, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the inquiries were anonymous, some workers were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett explains. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on the online store. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to rely on outside help.
More and more new types of personnel management start-ups have been introduced to the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee commitment. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and groups, provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the government by the top management.
"My own health can be monitored with applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employees' commitment.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says that he has gained a deeper insight into the ideas and feelings of his employees.
You can make quick inquiries and votes for certain teams, but you can also draw up a map that shows you at one glance, which departments are the most dissatisfied and which managers have received the lowest estimates, which have allowed Errett to drill into the heart of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uber. Ever since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups such as Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to Let's Talk Payments, can reach over $118,7 billion by 2020.
Convercent is a startup in Denver, Colorado, that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation was hit.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convertent allows companies to conduct tailored surveys, collect answers in confidence in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees may report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if there's any reason to suspect the manager is out of line, the complaints go directly to the board of directors.
"The authorities have been replaced by popular opinion", says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convertcent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose employees and be sued.
Ruby Tuesday has more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convertcent for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily get in touch with the head office.
Previously, it was the practice that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he first had to find out a phone number or e-mail address to report to the head office. Then he had to file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's Legal Director James Vitrano. According to him, complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from leaders in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"In the same way, we will protect our shareholders from legal proceedings relating to their employment relations."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after Arthur Andersen’s audit firm collapsed as a result of unethical activities in the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies understood that they could no longer prevent public clearance of their dirty laundry.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came into ethical control," Quinlan says.
Glint and Converter offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and an opportunity accepted by venture investors. Both Glint and Convertent support venture investors.
In February, Convertcent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received EUR 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of USD 60 million in funding.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
"Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they like the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of the LinkedIn Company for the Compensation and Welfare of Workers.
Investors get a return when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees commit.
Third party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
According to workplace culture experts, it is important to be aware of the commitment of employees,
But it is useless if action is not taken on that basis.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if change does not come quickly enough or if nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of the workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consultant, who has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
"If the company doesn't take action, the workers will start to wonder if they've been heard.
And does their opinions matter at all?
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting personnel surveys on a monthly basis and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from frustrated workers on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands her employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term sustainability of staff in the industry known for their high turnover.
"If the company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees", Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of concealing his naked female neighbor, says News Office TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging from a rope outside her window.
According to the woman, the camera on the cell phone was filming the apartment.
A frightened woman ran into another room to get dressed.
After the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon thereafter recounted in the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of secret filming has admitted to photographing a woman.
But he claimed to have only photographed her face.
The video on his cell phone had been deleted, and the police had failed to return it to evidence.
In the hearings, the man has admitted the crime, but has refused to commit the crime.
He was justified in his description by saying that he loved his neighbor "uncrazy."
According to the news agency, a man is being prosecuted.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than those of the export industry, for example, but should be reduced," said Olli Luukkainen, Chairman of the OAJ, on Thursday.
Temporary cuts in public sector holiday money highlight the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements that do not in some way involve holiday allowance cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts should only be concluded after the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luke predicts that the working conditions of the OAJ, for example, have been agreed in January.
Percent goals Luke did not yet reveal.
Lukeka is also the chairman of Juko, a public-educated advisory organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday allowance cutting increases earnings differentials
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is decreasing, while private sector purchasing power is increasing.
According to Luke, a fixed-term holiday allowance cut further exacerbates the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it should be determined how many pupils per teacher can be:
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between those who are best and those who are weakest are increasing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating and differences between both pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins’ players’ day was extended by the reduction of daily exercises by the NCAA from two to one
It's almost 11:00 in the evening, and a bunch of UCLA American football players have been left to talk to the other side of the new campus training fields.
Some have taken off their jerseys, and their backs are shining out of the sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of conversation is a noon break.
After three hours of training, students from the university’s summer courses return to the dorm to study for finals. The next morning they meet at 6:30 at the Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," says Bruins coach Jim Mora, shortly before Monday's change on Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella organization reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The purpose of the change was to reduce the number of players’ work, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three exercises started 15 minutes past seven in the evening.
Limiting the training sessions to one day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in Mora’s six-round Westwood coach season when exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to take place 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the season opening match begins: UCLA will meet Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says that she supported the change in the rules of the NCAA, even though it made the time schedules of the players even tighter.
"We load them very much for three or four days, and that is very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They are great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the rehearsals from outside after the camp. It is not easy, given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and the Lusk Center, a high-class hotel that has already been bombed over the net behind the goalpost with footballs.
Bruins players are supposed to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises from there on video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
There's a lot of money to be paid for the video from the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom for Rwanda
Presidential elections will take place on Friday in Central African Rwanda, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking his third term, but in practice he has had an impact on the country's management since 1994.
That's when the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Mr Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting the word freedom.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third term, Mr Kagame will be able to make a run for it, because the constitution that has been defined by the presidency for two years has been changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
In his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, even Kagame has promised his people more freedom after the land has been raised on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up the fact check
Facebook plans to send potential fake news more and more to independent fact reviewers and present the results below the original article. The world’s largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to the fact reviewers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the largest distributors of fake news. Many people believe that fake news affected the results of the US presidential election in 2016.
This has been the subject of a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the May presidential elections and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, will support the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that fact-finding is being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the screening of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightenedly what they read and share," wrote Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News Feed on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test related articles and will make other changes to his news feed to reduce fake news.
Origin of comic book: Story of a castle
The small Scotney Castle in the county of Kent is now known as the Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of turbulent history. Now, in a charming place in the Bewl River Valley, this castle is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an author with moped hair in old documents.
"I love being able to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says in a longing.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he appeared Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspiration was based on documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I went to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for Jacobites in the 1700s", Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because then fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives!"
An old writer who was attracted to documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council in England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he could not stay in the castle without delay a little longer than would have been desired.
He spent days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and raritys, such as hyena heads hung on the walls and bottles in the moat for centuries.
He wandered around the ruins and lands of the old castle and talked with forest rangers, gardeners and sometimes illustrative artists.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and started writing."
The closer history of Scotney is rather unknown, since the castle was transferred entirely to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation’s staff were only just starting to look through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years using the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
The archives contained journals, letters from the times of the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that ground disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "However, families fought here for even one birch.
I thought, "Let's give it a rest."
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man who soon after the castle was completed, joined the British peasant monkey in 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex says there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant monkey began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could start a riot.
"Maybe these events are connected?"
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of the priest that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell in the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral with stones filled with stones (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family's men seem to have been quite a bunch of guys, and they've been in debt all the time, buying things they couldn't afford.
The Darrell family men solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who knew how to court the heiress."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Lifeinmäki, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, where only a eutrophic plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this bloody everyday life yet."
Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, comments Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia of this and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," said Stoltenberg in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russia's continued instability in the East Ukraine region has led to a significant deterioration in NATO's relationship with Russia.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, U.S. President Donald Trump found that the U.S.-Russia relationship was even at a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump urged that we thank the poor congress of the countries, which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.

Klitzko, who struck gold at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 matches.
He held various World Championships in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitchko lost the last two fights of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him with points in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitchko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a wild fight in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitzko were expected to meet at a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
Klitchko, however, found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley game, Klitchko told me in his press release.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitchko’s reasoning for his decision on the video.
Bernd Bönte, the manager of Klitchko, explained in the press release that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitchko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitchko has been dating Hayden Panettiere, an actor in the United States since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter born in 2014 Kaya.
Klitchko's older brother Vitali is also the former heavyweight champion of the world.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Championships of different unions at the same time.
The weatherbreaker in Finland is witching the conditions: "Takes the feeling"
Seivashipper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer’s outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken her off her mind.
Even the London World Cup has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
Circumstances have been against Minna Nikki, the pole-sprayer.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn't even get the little stakes to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've competed and practiced here for God knows how many times and I've never experienced such varied winds in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmi at Games.
This season, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, with such unstable winds at rehearsals, Nikkanen said in Kaleva’s games.
The weather spoke on Thursday in London.
It's been a bit challenging getting the technology together. Is it cold stuff or what?
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken the mood.
There's no point in consuming energy in a bad situation.
He made it to the 455th World Cup.
It's gone 445.
Not everyone in London is in the same condition.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross Friday's qualifier 460.
Why don't you go work out abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was from the early season in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technology stabilized.
I probably should have done the same thing now.
Normally, you've been able to practice in the hangar. Now the hangar's been closed.
What would be ideal for a race?
Twenty-five degrees.
A little wind is fine, as long as it's constant.
"We don't have any room for division now or for many years."
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä's government must keep ice in the hat and be careful not to overwhelm the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who prepared the budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no room for division.
In 2015, Yle interviewed the retired Virta in Wednesday's First Morning.
The construction of the state budget for next year is about to begin.
Recently, politicians' proposals, such as raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bicycles, have been raised by Virtanen as an election speaker.
They are mainly indicative of the fact that the elections are getting close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no allocation available for now or for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about the divider when you take your debt," Virtanen said to Yle.
Mr Virtanen stressed that all debt owed to children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing the state budget: in 1978 he started as budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Budget Manager.
Last time he retired, he served as the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the projected 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All fortune tellers estimate that this is a spike from which to go down to the low point next year, and Finland expects a 1% increase for decades.
Washington is changing the rules for a permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the Green Card rules will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by Republicans and supported by the President.
A draft bill is due to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
Applicants benefiting from the new application process, who know English and who are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy," Trump said according to the media.
The wife of the queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the queen in the same place
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture, Prince Henry and Queen Margaret photographed in April.
The Queen of Denmark Margareeta, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, is not buried side by side, says the court of Denmark.
Traditionally, the dynasty couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has announced today that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court states in its press release on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's discontent with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the court communications manager Lene Belleby commented in the newspaper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with his mate.
According to the Court, the queen has long been aware of the wish of her spouse to bury her and understands the decision.
Moment of terror on the road: The car almost hit the highway
She had a common-law husband and two small children on board.
They didn't get hurt in the accident, but they won't get the insurance money if the other side isn't reached.
The accident occurred at Keimlanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi from Vantaa reports that his family survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his common-law spouse Riina and two small children of the couple drove on the motorway to Keimlanportti in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From Ring III's connection to the Hämeenlinna Passage, a white car drove along the accelerator lane, which was to drive the family car to the side," Tommi says.
If it wasn't for the evasive movement, the car would have come on top of Tomm.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing at a high speed.
Parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One child is just under three years old, the other child is under one year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky when nothing happened to us.
No one who passed even drove toward us, even though there was heavy traffic in the place.
The accident took place around 5:20 p.m.
Tom says no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and emergency services staff arrived and the family condition was checked.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi tells us that he and his common-law partner have low incomes, and they received a family allowance to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information on the other car, the family doesn't get the insurance money.
That's why the family wants eyewitnesses to find out about the car that drove the family into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children to kindergarten and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the registration number of the car was SIG.
If we don't catch whoever did this, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're gonna have to count every cent now.
Tommi hopes that anyone who sees or knows anything about it will be in contact with the police.
It is confirmed from the Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department that they have had a task on Tuesday evening at the scene of the accident.
The title and the case were corrected at 9:15: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, Tomm’s second car didn’t come along with the lane of the incoming ones, but had to drive from the accelerator lane to the side of the family car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with relationships through humor - The self-detector is seen at What? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first-born guidance to the What? theatre.
A self-detector is a musical theatre performance about past relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still makes you feel good.
This subject is being addressed by means of humor.
You don't stay in a bad mood, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been implemented with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what you reveal when you get to know a new person.
Do you think he's playing a role or is he approaching the other one with his jacket open?
A plotless act confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The proposal is made up of the texts of the working group and there is no plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws young people’s thoughts, it addresses people of all ages.
Jäppinen points out that the self-detector does not tell directly about his own relationships or the group's relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed together.
I'm sure my own values will be passed on by the show.
I don't think relationships are bad, but I don't think relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many Learn From Divorced Parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-detector draws a timely picture of young adults living in Finland who are 100 years old.
According to him, many have learned much about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes dresser Ella Snellman.
The musical arrangement is Jäppinen and Rokka.
The love of the theater broke out in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, studies as director of theatre expression at Turku University of Applied Sciences Art Academy.
It's two years back, and it's another one.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvola years.
The musician of the music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has played at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and, most recently, at the Linna Theatre in Turku.
I'm getting more and more interested in steering.
The self-detector got his premiere last week in Helsinki on the Narr stage.
The performance, which lasts about 45 minutes, should also be seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen's study town of Turku.
Self-detector Kouvola’s What? theater on 4 August at 7 p.m. and 5 August at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a terrible motocross accident - the neckline fractured
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of the kumparee fall circled the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued his dream of the Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experiment on new species.
There may not be many forms of exercise on earth that the Kemijärvin would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela says.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela had a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds in my house for a year, says Lahtela.
It was bad luck for the bribe.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the accident.
Driving a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't use it to get boundaries.
It's just so tough as a sport that you don't want to have too much fun with a 40-year-old like this!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long start behind as the head coach of the Japanese Freestyle National Team.
Lahtela started her job right after her career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his training period, Lahtela often challenged her protégé on the slope and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my own thoughts didn’t make sense either.
Not even among the species.
It was good to be still.
I actually enjoyed it because for the first time in my life, I was allowed to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become the head coach of Finland.
If he didn't stop, he'd be afraid he'd burn out.
It's easier to find places in the body that have broken down than intact!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle national team about a year ago.
About the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I traded motocrosses for Frisbee golf!
He's gone right out of his hand.
At worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-zealous trainer herself, she does not require that she be trained to be like her.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our sport culture there is room to be different and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been that way," says Lahtela.
The sex robots are coming and we need to be worried.
It is here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry – just when it had begun to feel that 2017 could not get any weirder.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
"We must begin to take seriously the spread of sex robots," says Foundation founder and professor Emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence, Noel Sharkey of Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being moaned, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with a warm silicone skin and artificial intelligence features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to its own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and to the type and colour of the fingernails.
Even more worrying is the fact that robots have "personality", which makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, such as shyness.
The Roxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a preprogrammed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality", the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It could be tired, chatty or "in the mood."
There are many worrying features about the spread of sex robots, which replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the oppression of women and outright rape fantasies as the user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resistant.
True Companion compares the Roxxy robot to the vibrator on its website:
"Why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their spread and development reflects something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subordination is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena reveal much about the spirit of time.
And a lot of people don't start acting weird or offensive until the market says they can.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have become more widespread at the same time as women's rights are under threat around the world and the President is sitting in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale (Your Orjatar) is not the most worrying imagery of it, such as pictures of hanging bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Attempts are being made to make sex robots as much like real women (with the proportions of porn stars) as is technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements to imitate human movements as much as possible.
However, their "personalities" are a long way from reality.
A robot can't leave a relationship or a situation.
They have no will or history of their own — nothing that points to independence or violates the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, led by ISIS Head of Unit
The head of the extremist organization Isis led a group of Australian men suspected of transporting the bomb to an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in Isis had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to the suspicions, the bomb was supposed to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us exactly why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas discharge device and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Associate Commissioner Michael Phelan of the Australian Federation says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
The good things about Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a model of common sense.
During the Trump era, it has already been repeated to the point of boredom that the strong division of voters on a daily level has also broken up families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspaper advisory boards taught how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to puncture our information bubble.
The least attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to unite families.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-wing poet in Chicago who has long been a button against the Republicans of our family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying influence.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins — including a Republican sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades — are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
It is a good thing at the dinner table, but, in a broader sense, it carries significant risks.
Trump has given new momentum to the left, but the distortive influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to terrorize his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the right extreme Republicans, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember Mitt Romney’s relaxed version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (and at least we’ve seen his tax returns). Compared to Trump, they seem to be very minor violations.
When Trump's term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate needs only to be lucid, and it immediately seems to be a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park Carousel, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
Carousel’s horses are huge, the characters in the middle — grotesque clowns and animals looking back in terror — are ominous, and the screaming music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Over time, many of New York’s hallmarks fade into disillusionment: the view of high buildings is getting bored, the silhouette of the city becomes too familiar and the reality of the city does not match dreams.
And after 35 years, I have still not completely overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in northern London. Yes Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub, but it does not count.
The carousel of the central park, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience — even to the point that two two two - year - olds, one eleven - year - olds and two women in their 40s enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, this week at the department store I was asked to assess my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
It's the same at the coffee shop in my neighborhood, but they also give me the opportunity to combine 15% service money with the estimate when I go to the counter and get the coffee myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer servant to put his person in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The lady at the department store smiled with regret when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Interi. "There was no trust in the management."
The FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuq Club of the duties of coach of the representative team.
The coaching responsibility will be taken over by Fabrizio Piccareta, a former assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in their current assignments.
In the past, Italian Piccareta has been an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Interin coaching team, has completed a UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets what happened.
Changing coaches is never an easy or pleasant task.
Shefki Kuq, however, no longer had the trust of the club's management, which now had no other choice," Håkans commented in the Society's press release.
The Piccareta contract is valid until the end of the period.
He and the rest of the coaching team are already in charge of tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to the evening reports, there's been a riot on the team all Thursday night.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club’s assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta had a strong fight with Interi against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture from the '80s... would you recognize a serious violin student?
On Instagram, violin artist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture.
Several haustages have been added to the picture to determine that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself marvels at the young woman who looks at the camera as serious.
A long time ago, serious, he sends a message.
If you can't see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
About a year ago, on Instagram, he released a pair of pictures of himself.
In one picture, he is seen 20 years ago, in the other he is posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders of previous years.
She was already 14 years old in the hospital because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which eventually came to light in 2006.
The healing began gradually.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to a hospital for chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year he received hospital treatment for cuts on his wrists that, according to the prison authorities, he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecutors complained of the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting multiple shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the bathroom.
The prosecutors have stated that they intend to appeal again because they consider the six-year sentence of Pistorius to be too mild.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be dealt with as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the sentence of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a group of unauthorized camped people in Sithon on the morning of August 1st, two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced the release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and already impose substantial fines on all those who camp outside the reserved areas.
Inspections shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry indicated that the right may impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Those suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal tolerance.
According to the director of the study, Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that balance the cells that cause inflammation, which strengthen tolerance, protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome may result.
Tests showed that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice with specific bacteria in their intestines.
The bacteria in question need tryptophan to make immune cells appear. Tryptophan is one of the ingredients used to build proteins.
"We discovered the connection between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of normal intestinal microorganisms," says Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophan in the mouse's diet, the more immune cells they had."
If it works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
In examining immune cells that strengthen tolerance, researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one mouse group had such cells, they were not present in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbes in the mice’ intestines, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice that grew in a sterile environment without intestinal microorganisms and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
Scientists wanted to find out how the bacteria affected the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus rheteric bacteria in fluid and transferred small amounts of fluids — without bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into cells that enhance tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mouse food, the number of cells that boost tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When the tryptophan count was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from before.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same tolerance cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus rheuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products of Lactobacillus reuteri make cells develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, there have been genetic defects associated with tryptofan.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inside of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus rheuter bacteria may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "nero" in his ranks after he made a deal with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "nero" in his ranks after signing a contract with Nemanja Matic. The middle field player debuted in Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started 2-1 with a win in Dublin, the last game of the UEFA Super Cup tournament before the UEFA Super Cup game against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression as a defensive middle-field player against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best shape yet, since he was not on the Asian Blue Shirt tour before the season began. He only made it 45 minutes in the field – according to Mourinho, it has to be changed before the season of the Champion League.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has natural football thinking ability," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting a game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of the four players he has prioritised.
"Three out of four – we have to thank the Society for that," he added.
"I'll be more pleased if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."

The Finnish women’s volleyball national team lost their fourth match in the World Cup to Germany in batch 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine of gambling is high.
Their game was smooth in every sector, Finland's main coach Tapio Kangasniemi reported in the press release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany runs the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we could swing along, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
Three matches of four lost Finland will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The grand jury has already issued challenges regarding Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has issued subpoenas in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury, convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already issued challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer known for the Kremlin connections.
Reuters, the news agency, confirms the information that the Wall Street Journal revealed earlier on Thursday about the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent out challenges in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known as the Kremlin, which took place in June 2016 during the presidential elections in the United States.
Also present were the then campaign manager of Donald Trump Sr. Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, current adviser to the White House.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has called a grand jury in Washington is a step closer to the Russian investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted to assist the grand jury in an investigation to investigate Russia’s involvement in the US presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign or his close associates cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on oath.
The large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence found in the prosecution's investigation and decide whether or not to press charges.
A British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and car with a hand wave
The British inventor is the first person in the whole country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he offers services to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam’s BioTeq company.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, a consulting anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as in the microchips of cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install it.
Northam's attempt to make house and car locks compatible with a microchip will cost 300 pounds to handle one lock.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers.
The White House's decision last month to fly a Navy helicopter to the South lawn of the White House was to pay taxpayers $24,000 for an American production event.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is known as Marine One when the President is on board. It was an attraction at an event held in the White House on 17 July 2017 where American building programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a number of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, there was a sailing boat from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested a helicopter to be present only about 36 hours before its landing on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event, as shown in the Navy HMX-1 helicopter fleet records.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of this because it's an exceptional event with a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 commanding officer wrote in an e-mail to his supervisor, who is the Deputy Commandant of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn at 17 July 7 in the morning and the event would start at 3 in the afternoon. The helicopter would not leave until the lawn field was cleared between 6 and 9 in the evening.
In addition, the message mentioned that if a helicopter were to be delayed from the White House, another crew would be needed due to the restrictions on service periods.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the incident, and the unit’s security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME magazine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the event was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act.
"It sounds like you can attend," said the Deputy Commandant.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tone.
At the event, the President spoke out in favour of the reform of health care and of the looser state regulation that was before the Senate at the time.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents have to use them on their travels.
but their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the president’s campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor’s presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America, where products made by American workers from all 50 states were presented," said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern lawn to bring the president to the White House with an accuracy of one centimetre.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America included a monthly crew training quota.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 hours on that day in “non-presidential support” missions.
According to the White House, there was no other cost to taxpayers.
Sikorsky’s publicist reported that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the south lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the President's duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly fees, the VH-3D helicopter's compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1's records, flights from Quantico Base to and from the state of Virginia to the White House took a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating the helicopter is clearly lower.
"It is misleading to calculate the costs for tax payers according to the level of compensation," says Walters.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual budget."
According to a study carried out by the RAND research company in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the incident, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thereby employ probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defence equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is entirely appropriate to bring it up."
It is not certain whether Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down for the driver of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump made jokes to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."
The lightning hit the Vaasa track and the trains have to be replaced by buses.
Passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is broken due to technical failure, reports the Railway Traffic Centre.
For the time being, trains will be replaced by buses.
The failure of the traffic control system was caused by a thunderstorm.
The railway transport centre did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repair in the morning.
Venezuelan State Prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative body in Venezuela
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court order that would prevent the appointment of a new representative body.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that last Sunday's vote is scheduled for Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative body was elected for the country, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, a decision to block has been requested because of suspicions of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also begun an electoral fraud investigation on the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company, which held the vote, said that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro’s allies were nominated for the delegation, and Maduro’s son and wife are among the elected 545 members.
In addition to changing the constitution, the parliament can break up the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the drafting of the Constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
In turn, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have declared that they do not recognise the new representative body.
Mr Maduro claims that the new Parliament is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
There are numerous wounded and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after oil prices fell.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new representative body is due to begin.
A Russian man handed over by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced the 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a US demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
In February 2016, despite Russian protests, Finland handed over Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities, says AFP.
In March of this year he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after a prison sentence has been served.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly criticised Finland after the arrest and said that a man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were criticised for having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecution, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish for user names and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the information by continuing to control internet traffic, which was used to make click tricks and spread spam.
According to the acting director of the Department of Justice, Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is also capable of pursuing cyber criminals in other areas.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco stated in the press release.
Modified at 8:58 a.m.: Corrected for littration of the sentenced person's name.
Narcos's third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will become the lead in Netflix's hit series
Even though Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered during Narcos' second season of production, Netflix's show is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that there will be a third and fourth season of production from the series. The third-period trailer has been released and presents the new villains of the series.
During the third production period, the US DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug trafficking organization in the world.
The organization led by the four godfathers is "like Fortune 500", except that there is a little more corruption and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages connections to Mexico, and Chefe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently announced trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peñana, who recruits US and Colombian policemen to the war on drugs.
New faces are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third production period starts on 1 September.
Kari Kola implements an exceptional work of light art in Paris
Joensuu-based lighting artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) will perform an exceptional work of light art in honour of the first Day of Light set by the UN in Paris on 16 May next year.
Kola's doing a piece of light art in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building at Unesco headquarters and the Globe monument in front of it.
With my work, I want to highlight not only the light, but also the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make the important things that I have experienced concretely visible," says lighting artist Kari Kola of his work.
I am very impressed by the invitation to be involved in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening ceremony of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated UNESCO headquarters in honour of the celebration.
I feel very privileged to re-impose my art at UNESCO headquarters, says Kari Kola.
The work may still expand significantly.
We will inform you about this later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light to mankind and to raise people's awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16th.

From Timo Soin, a question mark headlined: "After that came the Flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Uv.) published a blog article on Thursday, which is headlined with a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
During my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs in government.
After that came the Flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The Soin text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the flood parable.
Depending on the interpretation, there are phrases in the history books "after us the Flood" or "after me the Flood".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
Elections are only representative if they allow all members of society to vote, including women, said the head of the UN Delegation to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
The interim director of the UN Aid Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women are candidates for election in regional councils, three women are seeking to become vice president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized", said Haysom in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Regional Council and Presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has raised threats to elections at the same time as the international forces are moving towards an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Mr Haysom said that women's contribution strengthens democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and the sights are rushed through by large crowds.
Venice is suffocating for quick day trips to the city by tourists.
On the narrow streets it is difficult to move and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historical center, while hotels have replaced their homes.
The problems of tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, two or three hours is allowed.
You follow the ticket guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the prevailing and problematic tourism of the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark’s Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in Venice’s historic centre.
On the edge of the market is St. Mark's church.
The anger of the locals is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951 there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, has destroyed the environment and has driven the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years' time, there will be nothing but tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organising the demonstration.
The equation is difficult because ships bring to Venice the income they desperately need and create the need for a wide range of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is envisaged that cruisers would go further away from the historical centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, felt that the situation would certainly change if the administrative district of Veneto, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Venice is visited every year by some 20-30 million tourists.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Traffic on the motorway is bad for miles
On the freeway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the north-east lane has had mileages from Thursday afternoon's work during return traffic.
The area is covered by motorway coating, which slows traffic," says Savon Sanomat.
There is a 50 km/h speed limit for road works instead of the usual 120 km/h.
However, even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had progressed in some places on Thursday afternoon in practice.
On Thursday afternoon, road work took place on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi at the statue of Revelation, or golden deer.
I'm getting along fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published great pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon landscapes, among other things.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in his current home country, Norway, not least because he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-metre race in March by travelling around the track time 51.81.
One month later he healed the 400-metre fence running at the Norwegian record 55.38.
Soon after his record record, Iuel, who was busy using social media, found that fame and publicity had their drawbacks.
Men from all over the world began sending pictures of their genitals to the audience, evidently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of dirty pictures from people I didn't know, so I had to turn my account into private," Iuel told the VG magazine.
In an interview with the VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of photos he received.
I bet you can guess. He was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'm doing fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia first because of Dad's work, then Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand, and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches do not ask questions but simply give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete," Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the fence.
The foot injury put Janne Korve's entire career on the line - now in the World Cup: "It's nice not to get hurt"
It's been nice counting now that nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has enjoyed his beloved species again this season.
Last summer's career was still at stake.
In January, the leg weight injury had forced Korvea to the operating table, and the leg did not want to heal at all.
Even the hand had been hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether the boarding was going to continue or not.
Sponsor deals were out, and many things were open," Korpi says.
But that's what they say. Things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started pulling back into the hill.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it when I first went to the snow.
I was like, "Damn it, it's so funny again, let's take a couple more seasons."
The raven didn't get to count properly until September and October, but after a long landing break, it's been a big deal just to work out without pain.
The Kisoja Raven has only been around a few.
It's okay.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of ferrying for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to spend four years in one race, and then you're in a fever for that week.
I can't think like that, Raven says.
Today Korpi is racing in the halfpipe of the Spanish World Cup in Sierra Nevada.
Although individual races do not keep him on board, he always gets caught up in a lot of company when he's racing.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the International Ski Association has increased over the last few years, even though some of the ferrymen chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
It's a big race. It's a big show.
Although I think that appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level of the games.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-person Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
The bumps of the team, the 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkinenniemi are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was there when everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It'll give you new power, too. Raven's thinking.
There's still some way I can keep up on the slope, but otherwise I can't. That's how much power my friends have!
Janne Korpi has also built a different sports career in the background of the ferrying career.
The pilot legend Pekka Korve's son is addicted to race sports: the ferryman has his own racehorses for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on my way all the time, that's all I have to do.
But every day I look at at least the race results and usually some departures," Korpi says.
According to Korve, nutrient management and training are a potential career plan when the ferrying career comes to an end.
I don't want to plan that far, but at least that's a likely option.
I feel it like I'm studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay on the edge of time and develop, and maybe in the summer I'll even drive some departures.
If it's my future profession, then it won't be hard to start when you're already inside the sport.
There is also an Elitloppet cruise with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that will head for the Elitloppet race in Stockholm at the end of May.
Raven and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well for sale, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where there will at least be no bankruptcy.
A few months is still time, let's hope we can fill the ship," Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kitelle has surprised everyone.
Attendo Esther is the name of a new 41-sealed care home for elderly people to be built in Kitelle.
The 1700 square meters of floor floor area should be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbor Health Road.
For crystal, the general reason for wondering is where customers are enough for the new care unit, because now many private nursing homes are suffering from a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Director for Care Services, commented that in the future, Kitee will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better," says Flink.
Last year Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kitee in Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The transaction concerned business, but the property is reported to have a five-year lease.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's cookie manufacturer's directors of the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish Department of the General Trade Union of the United Kingdom, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products are manufactured by more than 500 employees.
The company that owns the McVitie's brand, Pladis, said that over five million pounds was invested in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be "probably the first to be informed" if changes are to be made.
In its letter to the factory manager, GMB calls on the company to 'responsible for the lack of funding for the modernisation of production lines'.
Mr Duffy, the GMB trade union, finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager cannot provide clear information on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here generation after generation, and the labour force is strongly concentrated in the local community and in the metropolitan area of Glasgow. The factory is an important employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and Brexit, rising cost of living and continued reduction of production, Eastern Glasgow urgently needs successful McVitie's production."
According to Pladis’ spokesman, the factory manager had received a trade union letter only the previous day and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the continued interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and insecure companies, we are constantly assessing all our businesses and establishments in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the reporter, the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, in particular its production lines and improved operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production plant and we will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the pursuit of Neymir after paying £ 189 million to close the contract, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
A sensational move is the most talked-out event of the summer. The French football team in Ligue 1 is ready to break the world record of the settlements. The previous record was less than half that: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a change of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as the PSG will provide him with more than £500,000 a week’s salary after tax.
Barcelona is known to be furious about the operation of the PSG and the way Neymar has been forced to leave the company. The source near Barcelona tells us that the company has been very well-involved with Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Mauitid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're after our players, we'll be their opponent and we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're after our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed its interest in Marco Verratt, the middle field player of the PSG earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.
Neste slowed down the rise of the stock exchange - Stock Exchange News - Evening Sanomat
The second major performance publicist Metsä Board was on a lighter landing.
The large European general index, Stoxx 600, had risen by 0.1 per cent as Helsinki closed.

Now, the calls Trump made were made up by a White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump’s frankincense calls with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the Scouts’ organization have proved to be invented.
The White House spokesman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto Trump had discussed the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty big accusation.
Those conversations took place, not only on the phone, but face-to-face, Sanders explained.
Talk to the Boy Scouts was a source of disapproval
On Monday, Trump reported that the Mexican president called him and praised Trump for his success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few of them will ever cross the southern border of Mexico because they know that the trip will in any case stop at the U.S. border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government issued a press release stating that this call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released the perfect version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That was where Trump gave his speech at a major meeting of the National Scouts' Association in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scout Leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Scouts' Association announced that it is not aware of any phone call from any of its leaders to Trump.
According to the press release, Michael Surbaugh, the leader of the organization, who had asked Trump for forgiveness from the scouts, speaks for himself.
Trump’s speech at the meeting of the Scouts’ Association aroused much amazement, since it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.
