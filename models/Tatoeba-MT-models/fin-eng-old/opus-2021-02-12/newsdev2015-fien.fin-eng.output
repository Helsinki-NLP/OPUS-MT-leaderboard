Changes to business support practices - Region - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU business subsidies, the management of national business subsidies will be concentrated on four Ely centres from mid-September onwards.
In Eastern Finland, the Ely Centre of Ely-Savo in Mikkeli is responsible for the operations.
According to the new Business Aid Act, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Fund aid must no longer be targeted at large enterprises unless it is a whole new activity.
Subsidiaries of municipalities with over five thousand inhabitants are also counted as large municipalities.
Instead, EU support can continue to be granted for investments improving the conditions of local government business life.
In Eastern Finland, the unit managing EU and national subsidies will have the strength of approximately 30 people.
At least for the time being, they will all continue to work in their current offices.
For example, Kalevi Hölönen, Head of the Structural Funds Unit at Ely Centre Ely Centre in Etelä-Savo, is employed in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now striving for in Ukraine
Russia is consistent, even if it does not always seem so.
Chief of the National Defence College Strategy Department, Lieutenant Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by Monday morning's conflicting news about Ukraine.
This has been the same thing for a long time," Siren says.
On the other hand, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (see more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its paratroopers are currently fighting with the Russian tank division near the Luhansk airport, and that the tank division has received reinforcements (read more here).
Mr Lavrov insisted that an immediate cease-fire should be established without conditions in the negotiations in Minsk.
Russia denies that it is involved and that the result of the negotiations must be reached immediately so that they can establish their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big picture: we have to start negotiating quickly and precisely so that Russia gets its grip on the Luhanski and Donetsk regions.
Finnair outsources cabin services to a Norwegian company, lay off people
Finnair will start purchasing cabin services as a subcontractor from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement concerns Finnair's Hong Kong and Singapore routes in the first instance, but it is expected to be extended later.
Outsourcing of two routes in Finland leads to a reduction in the total of approximately 100 person-years of work, which is carried out in the first phase with layoffs, the company reported in its press release.
In addition, about 80 Asian temporary agency workers stop working when routes are outsourced.
Finnair already announced in June that it intends to outsource approximately 20 routes in the next two years.
Externalisations were concluded when no agreement was reached on the savings with the staff.
Externalisations are scheduled to start in January-March next year.
According to the company, negotiations with other partners will continue.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nerve - related back pain, or sciatica, among those who do heavy shift work.
The Finnish Institute of Occupational Health survey followed firefighters for 13 years.
The connection between sleep disorders and sciatica trees is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance of firefighters, which are regularly tested, do not seem to protect you from pain, says Dr. Sirpa Lusa, director of the research.
Firemen’s work is irregular shift work, where shifts can last up to 24 hours.
According to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
Harms easily to other apartments
Water damage The water damage is not always caused by a leaking pipe or tap, says an expert at the hosting association.
We have been contacted when the breakage of the aquarium has caused water damage in the building company, that it is possible to ban the aquariums," says Marina Furujelm, legal expert at the hosting association.
Furujelm points out that not only pipelines and sewers are the common cause of water damage, but now also more and more new machines such as ice cubes have caused water leaks in homes.
Many people are not aware that machines such as washing machines or washing machines must not be left unsupervised.
The tap must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, otherwise pressure in the pipes may lead to water leakage.
A resident may be regarded as guilty of negligence in the event of failure to fulfil these obligations, in which case the victim is liable for the damage.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can compensate for the damage, depending on the terms of the insurance and the case.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused damage due to negligence, the resident shall be liable.
If the resident has passed out in the shower on top of the floor well, it can often be proved that there has been a flood of water in these cases and the janitor comes into an apartment where there is an exhausted resident.
Furuohjelm tells us that due to the increase in the number of shutdowns on floor wells, many student apartments are now equipped with two wells in shower rooms.
Water damage has also been caused by waterbeds, although not as much as before, when they were more popular.
Even a dog’s water cup and the fall of a home wine container can cause real water damage.
I also know of a case in which there were many cats in the apartment who had peed on the floors so that there was extensive damage," Furujelm says.
The principle of liability for damages always goes the same way if the company’s statutes do not provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and damage to the structure of the building company as well as damage to other dwellings.
Water damage can easily cause damage to other homes, as the structure of concrete absorbs water very easily.
According to Furujelm, battery leaks in apartments are particularly difficult because batteries are easily leaking in subtle structures.
Water damage can now be caused by more widespread air - heat pumps that produce condensate water.
Water should lead to a solid sewer or rainwater network, not just a vessel.
The partner is also responsible for removing water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, the legal expert advises.
The Furujelm advises that even if the rules of the housing company do not require, for example, a fixed discharge hose for the washing machine, insurance may be subject to a condition that is why the compensation is not received.
You might want to pay attention to your own home insurance policy.
However, I believe that the drainage pipes in the bath, for example, are isolated from the washing machines as a major risk, which has caused many damage.
I recommend that the drains should always be kept in the sewer system.
Removal of snow and water on the balcony
Control of washing machine, washing machine, etc. when on.
Closure of water taps (washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor well is visible, partly twice every six months.
The recommendation is to connect the drains to the sewers in a solid way.
Check the faucets and their possible leaks
Regular freezer thawing

F.C. Honka lost again and turned into a serial jumbo.
At Tapiola Sports Park on Sunday night, two of the weakest teams of the football’s Sports League were faced with a fitness bar.
In June, FC Honka, who celebrated the last victory, will host the Vaasa Ball Society, which has sailed in a seven-game winning streak.
The VPS just won Honka in July.
Meeting Sunday with the Espoan team came to a good seam, as the VPS returned to the winning position for a long time by reading 2-1.
Before the game, Vaasan head coach Olli Huttunen complained about his team's inefficiencies, but the confused Honka defense eased the VPS's goalmaking problems.
A game of very nervous performance.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we couldn't keep the ball," Huttunen evaluates his own performance.
In the first half of Honga's top duo Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played very uncertainly.
Both paints from Vaasa were created as a result of loose play of tops.
The opening goal of the match was only seen after a five-minute game when Steven Morrissey steered the Honka goalie Walter Viitalan, who was jogged by Sebastian Strandvall's shot.
I'm sorry about the first half.
By the way, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game," Honga’s head coach Shefki Kuqi manasi.
After the initial shock, the Espoans got their game together and rolled the ball at the head of attack.
In particular, middle field player Carlos Portela and winger Roni Renokara were eager to search for places to do it, but the last few solutions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The closest to the goal was the Honga Midfielder Jussi Hammer, whose 20-metre shot was, however, slightly past the VPS goal.
The VPS effectively attacked using its clever attackers and Honga’s crazy pair of tops.
At half an hour, when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got a 2-0 hit, the Vaseans got a two-way pass.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was in a good playback during the opening period and repeatedly created situations on the left side.
Stewart's speed, on the other hand, seemed to be too much for Espoian defense throughout the game.
"I shouted at halftime that if you lose, you lose with honor," Kuqi said.
In the second period, the detached Honka ran wildly for narrowing paint.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third attempt was successful.
The Bounty Attacker Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal in the middle of the penalty zone.
After Vilaboa’s goal, Honga had half an hour to even the match.
The Espoo team was taking more and more risks, which allowed VPS to engage in dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got their hands on Viitala once, but Honka's goalie's tumults kept the home team in the game.
And towards the end, Honka got a little tired and couldn't score any more goals.
With the loss, Honka cast the last of the bet leagues, while there are still seven matches left.
Journal: Putin’s threats to take Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin had a very loud telephone conversation with EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Mr Putin expressed his indignation at the European Union's plans to tighten up sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica tells me Putin said so.
According to the paper, Putin's message to Mr Barroso was this: Don't annoy Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave Russian television number one an interview on the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night.
In the interview, Mr Putin said that he considered the conflict to be entirely within Ukraine and that he urged the Government of Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the shooting of civilian targets in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't stand by" if people are shot to death at close range," Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The acting work destroyed the family
Hard work The stage actor and the theatre family grew to recognize how his first marriage was destroyed by the acting profession.
The actor Esko Roine will be 70 next Friday, but I think he's got a saying that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to one year ago or two years ago or ten years ago.
Mental puberty seems to continue, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but he's still working for a lot of guys.
It was sometimes joked that not many plays were made in this country without Esko Roinetta.
At the moment, Roinee has a role in the Helsinki City Theatre play How to be successful in business, in Tampere's Tampere Worker Theatre's Mind-streaker and in Tampere's Comedy Theatre's Quartet.
Roine will also be seen in the upcoming Ricky Rapper movie.
PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen
Roine's acting career didn't start out promising.
I wasn't good enough for a road boy at school.
40 to 50 years later, the teacher said it was because I was so bad.
Esko Roine was not discouraged.
The choice of career was clear. There was no choice.
It felt close and dear.
I was so busy in the business that I dropped out of school and volunteered to join the army just to get into theatre school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatre roles and 300 TV shows, depending on how they count.
If you count things like English, that every part of a TV show is your own show, there's over 600 TV stuff.
I was in New Day for three years, three episodes a week.
The other spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments until autumn 2016
Esko’s older sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full swing and play in Tampere’s Workmates Theatre yet to make the huge roles as anarchist grandmothers.
My little brother's gonna be on stage for years to come.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about a guy this age.
I always have to take a little reservation to come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
The years have also left their mark on the man.
Age doesn't come alone.
The knees have been operated, the hip whistles, and the osteoarthritis troubles, but when you don't let it get too disturbed, these get you, Esko Roine says.
Roine became familiar to the TV audience, among other things.
The pirate radio and one of the quizzes where he and Antti Einio shared hundreds of dollars.
It was Antti Einio, who was handing out crops.
I tried to tell you it was hundreds, not hundreds.
In the Reinikainen show, Roine was an overly important Inspector Rautakallio.
He became the favorite of the Tampere policemen, when there happened to be a lieutenant in the department who looked like him.
A cop stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled to me, "That Iron Rock is great!"
Working group successful
The theatre works in Roine's mind have remained, among other things:
Producer and Master Class of the Helsinki City Theatre, the death of the Tampere Labour Theatre and the long-day journey of Tampere Theatre into the night.
It's all about the fact that performances have been popular.
It's not my fault. It's the team that's been successful.
There's been some rhyming.
Pekka Woodhead's role in the film is one of those.
There are others.
It's because I've said yes too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the end result is neither me nor the viewers.
You can't pick your own jobs as a line actor.
It's just a nice thing to do what you've been told.
Along with theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the '80s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was an educational experience.
It didn’t work out at all when I tried to be the administrative director, actor and then a restaurant manager at Tampere Theatre at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year it became clear that there was no way to reconcile these two.
Typical was that when the show was running out or in intermission and I was already wondering if I would turn on the sauna, a call came from the restaurant that there are your friends here who hope to see you after the show.
Memoirs for Birthday
On his birthday, Esko Roine shows up memoirs, ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
They've created some kind of a knot from the memory of the face-wrestler.
When I was playing Zoom, they used to call me a face wrestler.
I didn't know them by name.
The book has been made for years.
Back in the day, Roine told me that there's no news bomb coming because he hasn't done anything so rough, or if he has, he won't.
I made a little introduction to the book.
I'll tell you what, if someone's waiting for scandal-stricken revelations or good gossip, you better stop reading here.
There's a lot there that's professional, as an actor as a theater director.
The publisher says there's also a lot of buzz about the hilarious theater school.
It was a pretty normal college life, but when I was a kid, there were all kinds of tricks.
It wasn't as wild as it was in Turka's day.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more I got from there than self-confident, that once the school's gone so far as to know that it's certainly not up to it if it doesn't get better.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I'd gone to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrinen, and I was able to work with them.
There were legends from my first father-in-law since Charlo Halttunen.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him during school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was in the same class as me.
Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttunen.
As a painful matter, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in the way that the daughter went to my mother and the son to me.
I did not think it was a good solution, and I understand that children are quite in agreement now as adults.
In theatre circles, it's not uncommon for silver to be divided.
In my case, some part was that I worked a lot back then.
I was in the theater with almost every case.
Then there was the TV and the radio on it.
I did a long day, and family life suffered.
On the day of the party, maybe a night off.
Esko Roine celebrates at the Tampere Workers' Theatre on September 7.
The celebration will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
There's a mind-repulsor there, too.
I was in my 50s and I was in my 60s.
When such an easy - moving play occurred, I thought that now even the seventy - year - olds would be held, so we could get them off with one beat.
Roine says there's no ceremonial ceremony on the actual birthday.
I think it's a night off, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have booked a gig for that day.
Or it's a weird night off that I'm going to have on the night off," Roine says.
Aviation companies are concerned about the supply chain
Some of Britain's smaller aircraft manufacturers are concerned that supply chain manufacturing capacity problems may derail the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase passenger aircraft production.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the aircraft manufacturing chain are currently enjoying an unexpected number of simultaneous aircraft and engine development plans.
Aviation and defence
At the same time as some people enjoy the order quantity, there have been warnings about the capacity problems at hand in the production chain and the price pressure.
"It is quite true that there is price pressure, especially now that the volume of production poses challenges," says Craig Gallagher, CEO of MB Aerospace, one of the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, Managing Director of the North West Aerospace Alliance, representing approximately 240 aircraft suppliers in the north-west of England, more capacity is needed.
"Do strategies and investment plans match these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure about that.
Above all, we need more investment in the new production facilities and machines needed to realise these production volumes," Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft construction is part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, CEO of JJ Churchill, which produces the wings of gas turbines, the company has a "haunting time" behind it when several new building plans were implemented simultaneously at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of an eye, we moved from very little production to a state where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we also had to try to tighten up.
However, it is pointless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded by investing £800 000 in new machinery and hiring 26 new employees.
Many operators believe that more investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed if Britain is to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation sector after the United States.
The chairman of Ford Aerospace and the fine mechanics engineer Geoff Ford from Tyneside says that the order sum should increase the trust and willingness of producers to expand and increase production capacity, as there will be enough work to do.
"If this does not happen, we will lose in competition with other countries," Ford says.
A few large players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, a company manufacturing aircraft and engine parts belonging to the FTSE 250 index, purchased UPECA, which manufactures parts of an aircraft in Malaysia, for £75 million.
MB Aerospace acquired companies in North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy start-up companies that create new activities, but in reality the most production is slowed down by the limited design and the number of engineers", says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure passed on to them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of operators in the production chain are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, director of the GKN aircraft manufacturing unit, also works for the British aircraft industry, the president of ADS, believes that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
The supply chain is under pressure, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"The introduction of new technologies and advanced processes is more important than volume," Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from the mistakes and are now more cautious so that the building volume is not increased too quickly.
As Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it was in great difficulty when the company lost and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, director of Rolls Royce’s aircraft manufacturing unit, says that the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain, which supplies most of the 18 000 parts needed to manufacture the jet aircraft’s engine.
"The road will certainly be bumpy, but we believe that we have done more in-depth work on the supply chain by selecting the best partners and by keeping in touch with the suppliers as they prepare for increased activity," says Wood.
According to James McNerney, CEO of Boeing, the company’s production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly towards journalists, which is very important.
The CEO of the Airbus passenger jet manufacturing unit, Fabrice Brégier, says that the company will do its utmost to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
"Perhaps one of the journalists will not succeed, and our job is to try to prevent this situation as well as support journalists and look for alternatives, but there are great problems to expect," says Brégier.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
So this is my job, and this is Airbus's."
Hong Kong demonstration groups are launching a "Citizens' Disobedience Age" in Beijing's ban on open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Activists supporting democracy are spreading on the streets of Hong Kong following China's rejection of their demands for open elections.
The groups in favour of democracy in Hong Kong stress that demonstrations can flare up and swear to ensure that the city will begin a 'Citizens' Age of Disobedience' in order to oppose the electoral reforms proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of protesters defied the coming rain as a rush against Hong Kong’s shining horizon as they walked into a demonstration organised by the Occupy Central Group for Democracy in front of the Council’s implementing facilities on Sunday night, where protesters urged people to take part in a large sitting demonstration to paralyse the city’s financial quarter.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing announced that it would ban the right of voters to publicly propose candidates in the mayor’s elections in 2017, defies such months of demonstrations that will further increase the division of the city.
The protestors will take part in the opening of the Occupy Central demonstration in front of Hong Kong's key government buildings.
"We want a fair and fair election," says 24-year-old website administrator Dion Tse, who participated in a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-yi.
The government has no respect for the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kong people.
China's Supreme Law-making Body, the People's Congress of China, approved plans for electoral changes, allowing only two to three candidates to participate in Hong Kong's first direct elections.
However, the nomination will require the approval of the 1200-person nomination committee, and opposition politicians feel that this will effectively prevent the holder of differing political views from being able to enter the ballots.
The protesters are participating in a demonstration organised in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong Government Building.
Police estimate that more than 2 600 people are currently participating in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed when about 100 protestors led by the Scholarism student group gathered late on Sunday at the Grand Hyatt, where the Communist Party member Li Fein was to stay after arriving in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, participated in a press conference with members of Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
In order to comply with the law, however, he did not say the exact date on which roadblocking would take place, but urged the participants to follow closely the development of the situation "within the next couple of weeks", while adding that the city would officially move into a "Citizens' Disobedience Age".
Benny Tai will answer the press questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said at the Sunday demonstration, standing in front of the billboard of two figures representing disobedience in China.
That person is taking over the center with you!
A 17-year-old convening of Scholarism, Joshua Wong, said earlier that preparations for high school students’ demonstrations are underway and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to protest by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, the Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Congress, Li Fei, told journalists that defending the universal right to vote 'international demands' is 'a waste of time' and comes from some of the Hong Kong politicians who are trying to 'mixed society and mislead it'.
"A lot of time has been wasted on impractical proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate," Li says, demanding that the electoral process should be created in such a way that it fits in with the real situation of each society and the legal framework.
A bill on universal suffrage can only be adopted if a large majority, two thirds of Hong Kong's 70-person legislative body, is in favour of it, which means that the 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong could be dragged into a prolonged political debate if the reform proposal was rejected by veto.
"It would harm business and the development of the city," he says.
Nearly 800 000 people voted in an informal questionnaire organised by the Occupy Central movement in June to oppose China's demands, and according to the requirements, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
As many as 172 000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, while the march of 17 August for Beijing and against Occupy Central attracted some 88,000 participants, estimates coming from the University of Hong Kong, although estimates from police and organisers differ considerably from these figures.
Three wounded lightning strikes at the beach in New York.
In a lightning strike at a beach in New York City, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, the men were injured on the Orchard Beach beach in Pelham Bay, Bronx, on Sunday night, when the storms were going across the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
Lightning struck when heavy thunderstorms swept over the city.
Stormstorms, thunder and lightning interrupted the Labor Day weekend celebration and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on the East River Island.
Tens of commercial flights to city airports were delayed due to bad weather.
A new idea is not meant to please
This is the latest guidance for employees and managers of network users and is distributed by Harvey Schachter, author of Monday Morning Manager.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea is recognized in such comments as "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – i.e. boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so limited that it is not worth pursuing.
While a historian at Harvard, Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as Rector of the University, he repeats the same thing several times in order to get the message across widely.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman feels that TV and radio are the best tools for creating demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading news online does not mean that the Internet is good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular communication tool but a bad alternative for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson says that one word is enough to motivate employees: together.
In one study, participants were told that they would solve the problem in cooperation, even though they actually worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than the participants who were not informed about the cooperation at the beginning.

Cataract surgery at Mount Stuart Hospital under ban due to a safety risk
The specialist has been suspended from office and the UK National Health System NHS has stopped directing patients to cataract surgery in that private hospital after the hospital’s problems were raised.
Two people went to Torbay Hospital for emergency care after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that they have been in contact with 19 patients who were treated on 26 July and invited them to an “urgent clinical trial”.
Mount Stuart Hospital apologized for this and said that it had been investigated since the doctor was dismissed.
The matter came to the attention of Torbay Hospital when two patients who were treated at Mount Stuart sought emergency care because of eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients, all of whom were examined on the same day, have required corrective surgery.
Torbay Hospital and the Hospital District of South Devon and Torbay have not directed patients to Mount Stuart since the problems occurred.
David Sinclair, interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, which runs Torbay Hospital, said that "we have identified the problem in its early stages and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Whenever we direct patients to the care provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its permit issues are in order.
According to Gill Gant, head of patient safety at the Hospital District of South Devon and Torbay, "patient safety is always top priority, so it is important that these cataract surgery is not performed until we can be absolutely certain that the treatment is safe".
Ramsay Health Care UK, which manages Mount Stuart Hospital, asked for "a sincere apology from all patients who had complications".
The company reported that "as soon as we found out about a possible problem, we and later Torbay Hospital called all the patients in question".
This specialist has had a treatment permit for Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been a registered doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4,537 cataract operations in different parts of the organisation. According to statistics, the clinical results of his operations have been excellent and the rate of complications has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor was suspended until the case was examined.
What's "4chan"?
The notorious anonymous messaging site was the first to publish naked photos of celebrities leaked.
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option when he released stolen images?
"4chan" was set up in 2003 and is a communication site that has sparked a debate, which is as much barked up as it is praised.
The site is divided into several sections, so-called bulletin boards, where anonymous users can discuss everything possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online platforms, users do not create one profile that is constantly used and their publications are not kept.
On the most popular bulletin boards, comments may disappear in less than a minute, as newer publications replace them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprisingly creative atmosphere in "4chan".
Members of an anonymous community have created some of the most well-known media on the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to a lot of questionable or even criminal content on the site.
The most popular bulletin board on the site is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and is regularly published with NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This can contain tame porn, but also brutal and shocking images. An anonymous hacker published stolen photos of celebrities on this particular bulletin board this weekend.
American CytRx invests in cancer medicine research and development
CytRx aims to cure cancer – or at least slow it down.
A biopharmaceutical company in Los Angeles, which recently became the target of a loss of power through the sale of shares, specializes in research and development of anticancer medicines.
The most promising medicine is aldocosorubicin, a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx is conducting clinical trials in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, Kapos sarcoma associated with AIDS and recurrent glioblastoma or brain tumours with aldocosorubicin.
It is like a controlled missile that goes directly into the tumour and not into the rest of the body," says the CEO of CytRx, Steven Kriegsman, from aldocosorubicin, an anticancer medicine.
Aldocosorubicin contains so-called combined technology that acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the blood, which also accumulates in the tumors, which causes the medicine to pass directly into the cancer cells.
I donated the medicine only in an acidic environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows patients to receive more and more doses of the anticancer medicine.
"It's like a missile that goes right into the tumor and not into the rest of the body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on developing medicines, CytRx does not make a profit.
The company sold shares this year and thus raised $86 million to maintain and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide for the pivotal 3-stage clinical trial of alternative therapy for soft tissue sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the body’s soft tissues such as blood vessels, muscles and fatty tissue.
Alternative treatment is used for cancer when the initial treatment does not produce results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorisation as early as 2016, says Kriegsman.
The medicine could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that data released by CytRx from a previous clinical study in December showed that aldocosorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
"The question for a long time was "We have not seen any clinical data on how different it is from the medicine itself," says an analyst at H.C. Wainwright & Co., Andrew Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
Fein says, however, that it is difficult to predict the results and timing of the current clinical trial because it differs significantly from the previous study, which produced good results.
"Many things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of pharmaceuticals to the mining industry.
"First, a lot of money will be invested to find that one gold vein, and the investment will continue until that gold vein is found," he says.
Money will be spent on research and development until the medicine is commercialised.
Several shareholders have called CytRx to court because they felt that it gave a better picture of the reality of its success.
In the actions, the company is accused of hiring a DreamTeam Group, which then allegedly hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another company in the biotechnology sector to articles published on pages such as Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaints, it was not found in the articles that the companies paid commissions to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that it had deleted articles "that were contrary to practice".
Several articles on the company were also deleted from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired an external lawyer to respond to the actions.
"I don't have time or energy to focus on this," says Kriegsman.
According to him, the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to work in biotech centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many ways a wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Views of Analyst
The price of CytRx's shares rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then fell to less than $3 in April when the allegations of advertising the shares became public.
According to Analyst, actions and negative publicity have lowered the price of shares below their actual value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure there's any easy way to bypass this issue as long as the concept is valid."
In the name of the law, the cameraman in the police series was killed in the middle of a shoot.
The photographer of the true event-based Act in Finland also died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of a shooting.
The cameraman filmed a shooting between an Omaha police patrol and a person suspected of armed robbery in a fast-food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He died quickly from the injuries he suffered.
According to the TMZ website, a person suspected of armed robbery was killed in the shooting, in addition to a cameraman.
The first series, in the name of the Law, has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been shown on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an external factor will take a decisive role in the court hearing that began today on Ulvila's death.
Anneli Auer is charged with the murder of her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Vaasa Court of Appeal will now deal with the case for a second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the District Court with new evidence.
The purpose of the Court of Appeal is that the judgment should be handed down this year.
The Vaasa Court of Appeal released Auer in 2011.
At that time, the court considered the possibility of an outsider to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening statement, the D.A. Kalle Kulmala explained the prosecutor’s view of the night of the murder and of the issues that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our view, the crucial question is whether there has been an outside factor in the house that has killed Jukka Lahti in the way and in time told by Anneli Auer.
It is a question of the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, the homicide began with a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he was leaving home and seeking a divorce.
At some point, we moved to the kitchen where Lahti held on to Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One of them took a kitchen knife," Kulmala described on Monday the night of the murder.
According to the prosecution, there are several evidences that there was no external agent present.
For example, there are no sounds from the emergency voice recorder.
Auer's oldest child... daughter... told me during the interrogation that she saw the person who did it when the man walked out the door to the fireplace.
The liberating judgment of the Vaasa Court of Appeal in 2011 was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the prosecutor, the daughter's findings cannot be true.
"The daughter didn't see an outsider in her parents' bedroom, even though she went there twice," Kulmala said.
The prosecution's new witness is just connected to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has reported the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to the woman, the only thing she told me at the hospital was that she only saw Lahti's body when she visited the scene of the murder in the fireplace.
Auer's defense is going to present the court with a series of investigation lines that the defense says the police haven't worked out enough.
Three years ago, when the Vaasa Court of Appeal released Auer from the charge, the court considered the DNA of a foreign man found in the haul as one of the references to an external factor.
The sample later turned out to be the DNA of an investigator working in the Central Crime Police Lab.
That's when they took a mass sample of 700 people from a DNA sample.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded," defence lawyer Juha Mannen said.
One of the new witnesses in the defense tells of a possible outside factor.
The Ulvilan woman told the police about a bourgeoisist who, according to the woman, had confessed to the act.
The police questioned him in the summer.
The prosecution ruled that the bourgeoisist had nothing to do with a homicide.
The prosecution made a request for an investigation of the woman because the prosecutor suspects that she lied in her report.
One of the new Witnesses in the defense is a nurse who worked at the Central Hospital of Satakunta on the night of the murder.
The district court of a hundred municipalities sentenced Auer to life imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the District Court judgment, the possibility of an external agent was challenged by the reports of the children of Auer, the sounds of an external agent in the emergency centre are missing, and the time required for the events to take place.
Sentence came in two to one.
A minor judge wrote that contradictory evidence in a criminal case must be interpreted in the interest of the accused.
Therefore, the daughter’s story must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the contradictions of the story, she had found an outsider leaving the door of the fireplace.
The two oldest children of Auer have been called upon to be heard by the Court of Appeal.
The daughter was first heard personally last year at the District Court of Satakunta.
When he was heard in court, he no longer remembered what happened the night of the murder.
Auer's second oldest child named her mother's killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me in front of him what happened the night of the murder behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to be killed for six months.
As the plaintiff, the son has no obligation to pronounce anything in court.
The court hearing will continue today by hearing Anneli Auer.
If necessary, Auer's hearing will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently serving more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20 meeting?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him the number one enemy in the world.
Putin is due to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is discussing the question of whether or not his entry should be allowed.
The Punkrock activist group Pussy Riot called on Australia this weekend to ban Putin's participation in a summit with more than 4,000 representatives from the world's most influential countries.
"This person has nothing to do with the G20," Maria Alyokhina said to the audience at Sydney's fully packed opera house in connection with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that it is on the brink of a 'perfect war', and Putin calls parts of Ukraine 'Novorossia', 'New Russia'.
Tony Abbott has said that he is weighing on the decision.
According to Mike Callaghan, Head of Unit G20 of the Lowy Institute Research Centre, the Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Australia can decide who it will let into the country, but it is an international meeting," he says.
Just as New York hosted UN meetings or Washington hosted International Monetary Fund meetings, "it is not up to the host to deny someone invited to come," Callaghan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said that he was "weighing the decision" after Russia's reprehensible actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
As Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia is not entitled to decide on this alone.
"But this is an important issue that I will weigh a lot, and I believe that other countries will do so in the coming weeks," he says.
People are attending an anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, Eastern Ukraine.
The event lasts for two days, involving a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest developing economies, with a total of about two thirds of the world's population, accounting for 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
The members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as some specifically invited guests from countries outside the G20, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was given a questionable task of balancing various interests under great public pressure.
He felt that the prime minister's best way of dealing with this matter was to take advantage of the opportunity to put pressure on Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand that President Putin make an accounting for his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to explain his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressures.
I think the world is waiting for them to bring these things up.
Russian-minded rebels are preparing weapons at Donetsk airport for the attack on Ukrainian military bases in Eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Mr Putin will attend, and Mr Callaghan says that this is not necessarily known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly states that 'I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November'.
The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, is "very reserved" for Putin's arrival in Australia, but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and the G20 whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events following the Malaysian Airlines accident and the absence of pity, responsibility and proper cooperation in the area of air crash, completely and now that thousands of Russian soldiers flock on the Ukrainian border, I believe that most Australians are very sceptical about welcoming Putin to Australia.
German business critics of "self-satisfying" Berlin
Some of Germany's top business leaders warn that Germany has become 'too confident' and 'self-sufficient', as the government's policy threatens the country's hard-earned competitiveness.
The criticism directed at the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel coincides with the fact that Europe's largest economy is showing signs of slowing down, causing concern as to whether it will be able to run economic growth in a stagnant euro area.
The criticisms of business leaders are the result of political decisions against the German business sector, including the introduction of minimum wages and the reduction in the retirement age of certain long-term employees to 63 years.
"I think the greatest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably causes a sense of self-sufficiency," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF, the world's largest chemical manufacturer.
The EU economy
He says this: 'There is a general feeling that we are doing well, that we have money to use and that unemployment is relatively low, so what is the problem?'
I think there is a great danger here.
The policy of the German Government shows that we are not focusing on growth and are not a favourable environment for companies, but rather we are focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German industrial organisation BDI, "the situation in Germany is now good.
In the next ten years, however, every developed economy will have to change. ...[in Germany] the reform programme will not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce (DIHK) has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost in balance, and even the already slow-down consumption is on the rise again.
However, the fall in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of export-winning Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2% over the previous three months in June compared to the previous year.
Germany’s weak performance threatens to make the ECB’s fight against low inflation more difficult and may make quantitative recovery more likely.
Mr Kerber would like the government to 'move from public consumption back to public investment', for example by concentrating future consumption increases on infrastructure rather than pensions.
In Kerber's view, the Merkel government is destroying the fruits of his socialist predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, at the beginning of the 21st century, with a strict policy.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Stiftung Familienternehmen Foundation for Family Business, "the situation in Germany is still good compared to other countries.
It is thanks to companies rather than government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example of neighbouring France has shown that spending money on social aid and restricting the freedom to run a business is the wrong way to act.
The leading German investment banker described the situation in more direct terms, saying that the recent decisions of the government are a 'disaster'.
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has worked so hard for, just to please the voters.
This is my main concern at the moment," says the banker.
According to Mr Bock, the energy reforms of the new coalition failed to address the fundamental weaknesses of the policy which have led to costs for industry that undermine competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher at the music festival after security prevented access to the fan
The actor, Ashton Kutcher, participated in the Stagecoach Cantrile Music Festival in Indio, California, where it is reported that she got into a fight with a strict security guard.
It's reported that Ashton Kutcher got into a fight with a security guard at the country music festival.
Kutcher’s fan tried to approach him at the backstage at the Stagecoach Music Festival in California, after which the situation got out of hand,” says the TMZ website.
Kutcher was in the VIP room when a young woman approached him to greet him and shake his hand.
When the half-man star went to greet a fan, the overzealous security guard intervened and caused a slump.
The actor and the security guard got caught up in the hand, and Kutcher’s friends had to intervene to hold down Kutcher,” says TMZ.
After he broke up with his ex-wife Demi Moore, Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is the star of the old '70s show.
It happened shortly after Angus T. Jones had practically been removed from the standard acting guard of the hit series after he published a video in which he calls the series "poor" and urges the fans not to watch it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher will attend the Stagecoach Music Festival in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake," calls the show "Jake" and tells people not to look.
The Baltic bacterium killed the holidayer
Six people have been sick by bacteria from the Caribbean, settled in a popular German tourist destination.
One of the sick is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but most of it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
Bacterial spreads most effectively in brackish waters above 20 degrees.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere as long as the conditions are right", Dr. Heiko Will, director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS) told The Local magazine.
Bacteria are equally found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the sick person had been on vacation on Usedom Island at the end of July.
He died in early August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg will have to amputate.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small wound on his leg.
The sick one went to the hospital when he discovered on the way home that his leg had turned blue.
Doctors found blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulgarus on the leg.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known the danger," said Sonja Bruehl, a sick woman, to Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious illness and the damage caused by blood poisoning to the patient and to the family could have been avoided if the information had been better available.
LAGuS informed the Dpa News Office that doctors were invited to the next infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official information was given.
Cool temperatures have caused the risk of getting sick with bacteria to be reduced.
“The results of the [Maanantain] tests showed a significant reduction in the strain of V. vulgaricus,” Dr. Will says.
Cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of cholera-producing bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person has chronic liver disease and a weakened immune response, such as in patients with HIV or diabetes mellitus and in the elderly.
The risk for men is higher than for women because estrogen has been found to protect against the pathogen.
If the bacteria get sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
When the bacteria are cut, the probability of death is about 25 percent.
V. vulnificus can also be contracted by eating marine animals contaminated by V. vulgaricus, although Dr. Will says that this is not the method of transmission in these cases.
The pollution of marine food is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus caused the last poisoning in 2010, when two people died from it.
Vieno Kekkonen: The breast was removed due to suspected cancer
Vieno Kekkonen, a singer at 80 years of age, performs and trains hard, but he has also had to fear for his health.
After all, it's incredible that the radiant Vieno Kekkonen is 80 years old.
He himself is amazed at how many years of age there can suddenly be.
I haven't really realized I'm this old.
80 years does sound like a lot, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
His birthday, Vieno Kekkonen, is spending time with his family.
At the end of August, a birthday party was arranged for him by the People’s Music and Pensioners’ Association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on Kekkola's stage, the same place my grandfather was born.
I was overwhelmed by the party, the birthday boy tells of an event where the three hundred - dimensioned stage was full of congratulaters.
A few days later, at Muhos, we met to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers as a young man.
And now we're both this age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, there are few aspects of Vieno Kekkonen that have not been seen in public.
One thing he has never told in public before: in 2006 another breast was removed from him.
There was an unclear finding on my chest at a point where it was decided to remove it completely.
It was not cancer in the end, which, of course, made me happy.
The same operation had a new breast, so it was quite a big operation.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought that he has lost his own breast in vain, as it would have been difficult to carry information about an unclear discovery and cannot be ignored.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen says and points out that for younger people it must be harder to lose one’s own chest.

The farmer is made guilty of the state of the sea
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its link with Finnish agriculture is depressing in terms of level.
The voice of experts has been drowned in politically motivated opinions.
During the summer, Helsingin Sanomat and Yle in particular have insisted on the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient discharges to the Baltic Sea.
Rapid action to control emissions has been called for in the same breath.
The average farmer appears to be a superior nutrient expert compared to a few environmental researchers and their experts.
The farmer knows that the nutrient leaching cannot come from cultivation if the field has been sown with the same amount of nutrients as the crop harvests.
Almost all farms in Finland are committed to an environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires accurate monitoring and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities will monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutrients stored in the field have also been washed into water bodies after fertilising restrictions, but there has also been a marked reduction in emissions for years.
Farmers are willing and ready to continue working to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to zero is impossible.
"If we want to have about the same amount of agricultural production as consumption, we just have to accept that this is the case," says Jyrki Aakula, Director of Environmental Research at MTT (MT 29.8.).
The past summer brought the Gulf of Finland extensive blue algae deposits.
Scientists were quite unanimous in the fact that algae grew from marine phosphorus reserves.
The phosphorus stored at the bottom of the sea is partly a reverse of the agriculture of coastal states over the past decades, but that alone does not explain the stocks.
The wastewater treatment in the growing cities of the Baltic Sea was in decline until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also affected the waste water of Great Helsinki and was not seen as a problem but as regards the pollution of its own beaches.
The pollution of beaches was prevented by the construction of a sewage pipeline in the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of the water directed to it has improved over the years.
Nutrients that once ended up in the sea will not leave there, even if agriculture is completely discontinued from Finland.
Yet every summer the blue algae debate and the accusations that have been made are always directed at the agriculture of today.
The public debate marks the farmer as guilty of the state of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes more and more difficult when it is used to carry out political passions.
Under the leadership of their chairman, the Environment Minister Ville Niinistö, the Greens are pushing for major changes in agricultural environmental standards.
As a springboard Niinistö has used the summer algae discussion.
Niinistö has accused the producer lobby of being old-fashioned and considered it the most difficult obstacle to the protection of waters.
There should be a line on political rhetoric.
Most specific projects in the field of water protection are based specifically on cooperation between MTK, farmers and environmental management.
Niinistö’s aggressive style serves more the fishing of urban green voices than the protection of water.
I think that's the point.
With hard talk, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, MTK's task is to ensure the livelihood of its members.
It is difficult to trade changes that are expensive for farmers unless there is a replacement for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has proposed is the cuts in other agricultural money.
The abolition of mining tax does not go through: Palmer
Abbott's government's latest attempt to throw a mine tax into the trash can looks doomed, since Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without change.
The Australian Workers' Party also fears that the government has included in the new initiative a rule that could limit employers' contributions to compulsory pension contributions up to 2034.
The government took advantage of the qualified majority in the House of Commons on Monday to rush through the process of repeal in the face of widespread confusion and the clear indignation of the Labour Party.
It sidelined the original initiative to repeal which had previously been substantially amended by the Senate and replaced it with a new legislative proposal, which it described above all relates to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
Originally, it was an initiative aimed at abolishing the "unsuccessful" mining tax and other decisions such as the low-income pension contribution ($3.6 billion savings), the bonus for income support ($1.3 billion) and the bonus for school-age children ($4.7 billion).
The president of the Palmer United Party (PUP) Clive Palmer did not approve of the transfer of the government.
"A poorly designed mining tax abolition initiative will not be accepted in the Senate without a pension contribution for low incomes, a bonus for earned income and a bonus for school-age children", he tweeted.
The government needs the support of independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
The Shadow Finance Minister, Chris Bowen, accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory guarantee amount for pension payments, giving the Minister of Finance all the power of decision.
"This is unheard of," he said to journalists in Canberra.
This would allow the government to delay further increases, allowing the 12% guarantee rate for the Labour Party's pension contributions to move up to 2034.
"It is not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will, of course, resist by all means," says Bowen.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to halt future increases.
The man's body was found on Brighton's beach.
Sussex police picked up an unidentified man's body before the tide of two afternoons closed the area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
The police and the coroner are working to determine the circumstances under which the body went to the beach.
He hasn't been identified yet.
Investigators are going through the list of missing persons to see if the missing persons are connected to the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, one person was killed by an accidental explosion at the border.
According to Piedras Negras police, an accidental explosion in a customs building on the border between Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five others.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the operational director of the local police in Texas border.
He told the Associated Press that the woman who died in the Sunday explosion suffered skull damage and five others suffered burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred this morning in the accommodations of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion was caused by the build-up of gases.
The explosion didn't affect border patrol.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos are closing their doors this month.
A male client plays at Showboat Casino, scheduled to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means that this neon-light metropolis, known for the tin of money machines, can no longer count on gambling revenue.
More than 5,000 employees will be unemployed when Showboat and Revel Casinos close this weekend, the Associated Press news agency reported.
There will be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off his lights.
The expected closure of three casinos, one of which had only been operational for two years, is the latest disaster in the city since the end of the Atlantic Club story only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city’s casino employees, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, says the New York Times.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City, an AP news agency writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained many more competitors as casinos in New York, Delaware, and Pennsylvania break up much of Atlantic City’s once huge casino earnings.
Even Massachusetts, who opposed gambling in the past, looks at its share of the money by welcoming three casinos into the state.
TVO: Areva’s new schedule difficult to accept
According to Teollisuuden Voima (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment of Areva, the plant supplier, that Olkiluoto's third reactor will only be commercially used in 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that the construction work is already largely completed and the number of work in progress is known.
TVO will continue to assess the information received from Areva.
Mr Silvennoinen says in the press release that TVO welcomes all initiatives that can speed up the project.
Areva today provided TVO with an updated timetable for Olkiluoto 3, according to which the construction of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could start in 2018.
According to Areva's press release, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to the approval of the reactor automation systems received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was originally due to be completed in 2009, but the timetable has been postponed time and time again.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is discussed in the arbitration tribunal, where Areva has claimed compensation of up to EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva’s claims unfounded and requires approximately EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today in Stockholm in the framework of the 24th International Water Week. They called on energy and water operators to work together to meet the major challenges of our time, to ensure adequate water and energy production for an ever-increasing population.
The theme of the water week 2014 is Energy and water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and cleaning water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two resources are also an integral part of sustainable development and must always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
In the opening of the Water Week, Torgny Holmgren, Managing Director of the Stockholm International Water Institute, said that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore there is an urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water operators in order to find solutions to enable all nations of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, winner of this year's Water Week Water Prize, described water as a potential basis for growth, needed both by society as a whole and by other sectors.
They must mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that "there is no permanent solution to the [water crisis] anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
During the week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation between energy and water operators during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty King Charles XVI Gustava at a ceremony at Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.

Flying home dead foreign bodies in Miami: Costs of body flying
In October 2012, a ferry carrying 23 Cuban refugees to Miami fell, and 14 people were reported to have died.
The same has happened to hundreds of people before, and this certainly was not the last of its kind.
Every year more than 1 000 Central American immigrants die illegally trying to cross the border of the United States.
For the first town, they're ready to die.
Ironically, though, when arriving in the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, a platform of effort up or a place of entertainment while waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people imagine dying there, and as death approaches, many are planning to return to their homeland.
A disproportionate number of people born abroad and temporarily resident live in cities popular with immigrants, where death and return to their country of origin continue to work.
It is estimated that 20 percent of the bodies of those who died in southern Florida are flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, the short form of jargon from words to human remains) are flown to the country from Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, according to Pierson, the CEO of the largest company in the industry, approximately 80% of this traffic is transported abroad, flying bodies to several destinations in Central and South America and several European countries.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, returning home has a cost.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for flights to Latin America, and the figures in the table describe the human remains of the airline back home in 2013.
Returning bodies to the country is not cheap: prices may vary from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and public health requirements for the flight and delivery of human remains also vary.
Migrant communities in cities favoured by immigrants sometimes organise funeral communities to help with the cost, because the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help the process and the dead are often young people without insurance.
Some credit institutions and informal health insurance programs were born of such communities established by Italians, Jews and Greeks living in New York City — the first groups of immigrants in the United States.
New generations of Mexican, Chinese, Filipino, and Bangladeshi immigrants are now doing the same in many of their favorite cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few people who move abroad plan to make an immigrant city their last resting place.
For example, in Dubai, the Sharia Act applies to foreigners who have died without a will, even if the laws on the collection of the deceased's homeland are different.
All assets of the deceased shall be frozen and shall then be distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
Aer Lingus (
2013) The scale reflects the multicultural population structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline interrupted the service but resumed it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from the migrants.
The idea of death is seldom present when a person passes through a city favored by immigrants or while living there.
On the contrary – temporary or permanent migration to an immigrant town is an open declaration about the way an immigrant looks at life, not death.
However, death in an immigrant city abroad means making the most powerful and irreversible decisions for an immigrant — decisions as to whether one wants to be part of a local or a global community, a universe or a country, a short - term or an eternal one.
The Centre Party and the Left Alliance make the issue of inequality
The opposition parties in the centre and the left-wing alliance are going to put an intermediate question to the government about the livelihood of low incomes and the increase in inequality.
The parties want to stimulate debate on people's income problems, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and rising unemployment.
Increasing inequality is also visible between different parts of the country and within large cities, the parties point out in their press release.
According to the parties, cuts and tax increases in the government budget for next year are directed at low incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and regular employees, while food, medicines and housing continue to increase.
Almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their press release.
The income problems of those in work have also worsened.
On Thursday, the parliamentary groups of the Centre Party and the Left Alliance will discuss the matter.
The third opposition party, the Finns, has already announced that they are leaving the issue of police and internal security resources.
The autumn session of the Parliament will begin tomorrow Tuesday.
The New York City West Indian Day parade is about to begin.
The Caribbean culture is once again in the spotlight in New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, where politicians see each other and become seen.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It exudes the celebrations of traditional pre-fast carnivals, some of which are dancers carrying complex, often feathered costumes.
Eric Adams, president of the Brooklyn region, is this year’s festival champion, but there are also many other political faces to be expected.
The parade is a great opportunity for present and candidate politicians to greet the audience a week before the primary.
Despite the celebrations, violence has also taken place during previous years at the end of the parade week.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Is it worth asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows rhetorical questions, right?
You don't want to answer that question.
This figure of speech, that is, a question that is not expected to be answered, but which hints in the direction of a particular answer, tastes both high-level speeches and more common-day word exchange.
The opening words of Cicero's famous Catilina are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, are you going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same goes for the questions my wife asked: "Why shouldn't I warm up five days old chicken to the children?"
Why are you so tense?
The erotic theme is a finer word for rhetorical question.
The power of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open and the public is persuaded to accept the question.
The insidious rhetorical question suggests that no sane person could agree on it.
David Williams, author of the 19th century book of essay writing, described the rhetorical question as "some words addressed to someone who is admirably designed to give a strong sense of the truth about a subject, and at the same time the challenge presented by them is impossible to disagree with".
The Art of Convincing
You can ask rhetorical questions afterwards if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
A number of rhetorical questions, designed to express sadness or indignation, are called epiplexes.
For example, Job uses them to appeal to the Almighty: "What do you gain from oppressing me --?
Do you have eyes like ours?
Do you see the way a person sees?
The chains of rhetorical questions can also be found in my wife’s comments: “Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is a so-called hypophora, what is involved when you ask a question and you answer it yourself immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is the sex monster for all women?
Beard!
That's right!
Who would sacrifice their lives for their brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food that children have eaten and where could they have become sore?"
This chicken.
What idiot fed it to them?
You.
Strangely enough, the rhetorical question does not usually try to persuade, even though rhetoric means the art of persuasion.
If you try to talk someone around instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted or become enraged by someone’s stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions sparingly.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one to accept one’s own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument, "It is not nice when it's so sunny out there?", the rhetorical question says that the speaker is sure of his claim, which binds the speaker and the audience together better.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is convinced that there are no differences of opinion.
By assuming that unanimity has been achieved rather than seeking consensus, the speaker may seem, well, complacent.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weak point of argument.
In the newspaper headlines, the rhetorical question is all too often clearly the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Did aliens build pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to an answer that differs from the implied answer.
"Are you thinking what we're thinking?" was the high-risk campaign clause of the British Conservative Party in the general election in 2005.
The party lost.
For some, the discovery of such cases has become a hobby, and so-called QTWAIN questions (known by British journalist John Rentoul as Questions To Which Answer Is No) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organized a competition that looked for the best examples.
The competition was clearly won by the song "Do You Want Be In My Gang", which was sung by pop star Gary Glitter before he became a child sexual abuser.
The author has also written the book "You Talkin' to Me"?
Investigator: The time for a federal compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that a federal state could be some sort of compromise to the conflict," Saari says.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian channel that peace in Eastern Ukraine requires discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in Eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of those living in the East.
According to Saare, the transformation of Ukraine into a federal state is a priority for Russia in a certain way.
Ukraine certainly rightly suspects that Russia would use it to influence Ukraine's internal policy, he says.
In the absence of a federal solution, another option could be some kind of frozen conflict from Russia’s point of view, where Russia would effectively control Luhanski and Donetsk, Saari estimates.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied these claims, even though, for example, the Russian-minded rebels themselves have said that their troops have been fighting 'voluntarily Russian soldiers on leave'.
Upin Director: A powerful task planned for Katainen
Tiilikainen reminds me that the job description is new and is still emerging.
The idea, he said, was that Katainen would in some way coordinate or even lead the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment.
One of the Commission's priorities for the new period programme is, of course, the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, says Tiilikainen.
Mr Tiilikainen believes that Katainen's background, economic competence and role during the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plans, this would be a portfolio-free task, meaning that Katainen would not have his own Directorate-General under his authority.
On the other hand, Katainen would become a team leader in the EU’s competitiveness and employment sector, so that she could have other portfolios in the sector to coordinate, in addition to the portfolio of the Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
In practice, team management could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Mothers of soldiers: Up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Federation for the Mothers of Soldiers, as many as 15 000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the last two months, and there are currently more than 7 000 Russian soldiers in the country.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organisation, the Rostov City Hospital near the Ukrainian border is crowded with wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The soldiers' mothers collect their information from the soldiers' families.
NATO has estimated that there are more than a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte's drinking: "There's a story coming after a little drink"
Big brother Jussi and Andte drifted on Monday night to reflect on the life of BB.
On Monday night, Jussi, on the basement side, rode a fitness bike with Andte, a member of the Manor.
The two wondered what their actions looked like to the viewers of the program.
You don't know until you see it, Andte said.
According to Jussi, most of the time in BB is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or missions make up only a fraction of BB's life.
More like waiting and wondering and talking and living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday, the people of the manor spent the evening under damp conditions, and alcohol especially turned Andte on.
Jussi asked Andte if the party had made a man’s life in the house more meaningful now that he had been able to talk to other residents in a small hippo.
A little drink, and then there's a story, Andte admits.
Watch Andte's interview on the ISTV video!
Let Abreu reveal her body ideals We in Women
Anna Abreu tells us that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she was on a show break.
At the time, Anna, tired of gigging, thought that losing weight would give her more energy.
Fred Montana / Splash News
A couple of years ago, Anna fantasized about a body like Victoria's Secret.
My body crush was Victoria's Secret style.
I wanted to look good and I thought I wanted to lose weight," Anna tells the magazine.
Anna, who presents her trained body with gigs and music videos, says that she is not a lust trainer, even though she has been named one.
Viena Kytöjoki
Anna, in Timmity, trains at the gym and does boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can lift a certain amount of weight in the gym, says Anna.
Sometimes a pop star gives himself permission to feast.
If I eat, I really do.
Sometimes I take an unhealthy overdose, and I don't wonder if there's any more kilos.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
It makes me sick if I do something bad to my body.

Anna says she likes her body.
Business profit distribution is pleasing to shareholders but does not increase growth
Today, are the leaders of Australian listed companies merely trying to please a large crowd by agreeing to the wishes of shareholders for greater profit distribution and by buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power shifting from corporate governments to shareholders that the board serves?
The distribution of profits is the most important one, which became apparent last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies that have won investors in the form of buy-back programmes and by sharing more profits have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that the consumption of capital is decreasing faster than the analysts have predicted, and this fact leads many to wonder whether there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and whether there is sufficient focus on growth in the near future and long-term.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
More funding is obtained from, for example, low-cost stock markets.
From the company’s point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
Even if the funds raised on the loan market were not taken into account, it is clear that the generosity of the shareholders is financed, above all, by the fact that the company spends less money on investing.
The net result of this wave of purchase programmes (and the cancellation of profit investment plans) is the reduction of capital in the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period "the period of the capital bill", during which companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares low.
As part of the same plan, companies have fewer and fewer capital.
At the end of the reporting period, repurchase programmes amounted to USD 3.7 billion and the expected unrealised capital purchase programmes amounted to EUR 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to regard the consumption of capital as a curse in one of the headlines of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, informal evidence has been in existence for months.
The President of the Australian Central Bank, Glenn Stevens, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "fighting spirit" to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the prospects for individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, because slow capital consumption generally results in negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that "reporting companies' own estimates of their capital consumption have fallen by an average of 4% over the previous two years.
Estimates of free cash flow have increased by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase the consumption of capital.
This quick look seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and stock markets, but it is also some kind of proof of corporate obedience.
If I had a coin every time the CEO said that the short-term price of the stock is not important, I would have... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not true.
The CEOs are very closely monitoring the price of shares and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
Short-term and long-term bonus packages are defined according to the value of the shares, and the position of the directors depends on it.
The CEOs want to say that some decisions (whether they are acquisitions, increased investment in the organisation or profit distribution) may not always be immediately popular, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business managers often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted view of the investment market.
This is why the current wave of conservativeism seems to be a response to short-term objectives.
However, it was all too clear during the reporting period just ended that the emphasis was on reducing future capital consumption, and the most sparing companies were praised.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, took the lead in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also acted the same way — some of them under duress and others because they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why, then, are investors putting pressure on companies to share profits?
According to Credit Suisse’s strategist Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as profits from other, more traditional fixed-income investment products have been reduced as the central banks have suddenly lowered interest rates worldwide to bring more money to the market.
In this way, investors have been forced into the capital market to look for profits and, in turn, pressure companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would prefer the money right away as more and more investors approach retirement age.
Statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profit was heavily influenced by the cost cuts of enterprises and not by the increase in turnover.
The leaking of celebrity nude photos looks like a computer or an e-mail account.
According to Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources, the unknown hacker who leaked videos on the Internet is surprised by information security experts and Apple.
Although a hacker has published lists of female public figures in a chat room and has said that he has more pictures of women, some of the photographers have reported that their images are counterfeit, while others have said that they were pictures removed long ago.
There are a lot of people filmed, including Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
And were the pictures and videos authentic and from where were they downloaded?
The main source of the news is the unscrupulous and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service, which is the most unlikely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in information security teams working inside the house to try to penetrate the company’s own systems regularly.
"A large-scale hack into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim is correct", notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Data Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for the hacking of these public figures (as well as the hacking of people who are less famous every day) is the leakage of e-mail address and password, either by guessing or by fishing for information, i.e. by tricking a person into logging in with their data on a genuine-looking site, and then using this information against them.
Apple is still investigating the alleged attack on its iCloud service, which is used on iPhone phones to save settings and, above all, to backup images when they are transferred to the cloud server.
User's account can be logged into the iCloud service by providing this email address and password, after which their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-step authentication ("two factor authentication"), i.e. an additional protection against entering an account, whereby the owner's mobile phone will be sent a code before the account can be logged in.
However, relatively few use the 2FA feature, either because it is unknown or because it is considered to be cumbersome.
Apple will continue to examine whether all information originates from its iCloud service and, if so, how far the user accounts were infiltrated.
The company has not issued an opinion on this issue at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Forget password" link in Apple's iCloud service by first collecting the email addresses of the public, for example, from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in several services, when passwords were hijacked through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's pictures claims that the pictures are real, but he won't tell us when they were taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking attempt.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took for a terrible effort.
I have sympathy for everyone else who has been hacked," he wrote in his tweet.
However, independent information security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought that he had removed the photos from his mobile phone, but removing the picture from a modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the picture.
Modern smartphones regularly store images in a cloud service because they often lack space for a large number of photos taken by the user.
The standard setting for Apple's iPhone is to save images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft Windows phones store images in OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automatic image and data storage services.
"People take and delete pictures but do not understand that images are being downloaded from the account," Cluley says to The Guardian.
Mr Ferguson agrees: 'Departed does not always mean deleted', he says.
Pictures and videos can be kept for years.
If someone has access to the user's email address and password, they can reload all images and videos that have been sent by email.
From Apple's service, images can be downloaded to Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker released a screen image that was allegedly displayed on Windows PC as videos and images that were not published so far.
Two-step authentication protects against this kind of hacking, as it requires everyone who tries to copy an existing account to another device to provide the original user with a device, usually a code sent to a mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account is blocked.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a two-step authentication account, but it is not yet known whether or not these public figures used the service.
Some have said that the pictures they claim to be in are not genuine.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the pictures that Grande is supposed to be in are 'fully counterfeit'.
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweet: "The naked pictures of me are false, don't you understand.
Let me cut off the rumors right from the start.
Cluley's bringing up another option.
Since the hacks were targeted by public figures, someone may have broken into their accounts who handled their social media accounts or regularly handled their emails.
"I'd like to know if the actors' agents or some representative have anything to do with it," he wonders.
However, these public figures do not use a single publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed or helped configure one or more systems of the victim’s security attack and secretly changed the system so that all information can be returned.
This happened in the case of Christopher Chaney, a floridan named "Hollywood Hacker", where the hacker distributed images from email accounts of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis in 2011, and was sentenced to ten years in prison in December 2012, and was also ordered to pay more than $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of secretly entering email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera in the name of this stylist for pictures of a star in small clothes and then published the pictures online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions "were certainly one of the worst violations of privacy you could imagine".
Chaney was also alleged to have been spying on two people online for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, "in the case of Chaney, there was a break-in of the star's e-mail accounts, and they were changed so that someone also sent their data forward after changing the password."
Cluley says that the obsessive action of hackers who break into these accounts "reminisce of the gathering of butterflies".
They just want to collect this kind of information.
It is possible that, in this case, someone had come across a list of services such as Dropbox containing information on these accounts and login details.
The hackers may also have tried to infiltrate for a long time.
or they had access to data from an email account such as an address book and then fished for data from other people.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has provided its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped in Syria by terrorists associated with al-Qaeda.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to be holding 44 Fijian peacekeepers in custody, a terrorist group that captured the crossing point in the Golan hills last week and forced UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday and there is no record of their whereabouts.
At Samoa, ministers attending the conference of the small developing island states of the United Nations, including the Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon at the summit and has offered Australia assistance to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the UN in everything it can, including providing intelligence services," he said to the AAP News Service from Samoa on Monday.
We keep in very close contact with all the partners and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they're safe.
Bishop has already assured Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia is using its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, a Filipino peacekeeping team held captive in military barracks was reported to have escaped in a different part of the same controversial area.
Since the 1974 ceasefire, the UN has been monitoring the Golan hills in Syria and Israel.
Cheaters are trying to steal your money through a carbon tax abolition initiative, warn the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
Cheaters are using the carbon tax abolition initiative to steal money, the ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch unit of the Competition Authority has warned consumers and businesses against relying on government agencies to say that they are too sounding offers offering thousands of dollars in compensation.
Fraudsters may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much they can save on buying goods after the carbon tax has been abolished and offering them up to $7,000, the warning says.
Cheaters may sound very convincing because they have discovered the victim’s personal information that they use in trying to get their hands on bank information or try to get the victim to pay the reward.
They're discussing topical issues to trick the victim.
Cheaters use more than just a carbon tax scam to get their hands on money, and their stories are more sophisticated than ever, and they take advantage of current things to build a scam around them.
Also, the plane MH370 lost on the plane Malaysia Airlines and the death of Robin Williams have inspired con artists.
The ACCC instructs you to contact the company through self-cleared contact information instead of contact details provided by the caller if there is any doubt as to the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or email from someone claiming to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the abolition of the carbon tax, be on your guard.
If you believe that you have been cheated and provided personal information or transferred money to the imposter’s account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true — for example, free money distributed by the government — it is likely to be.
Financial messages: Lipponen reproaches EU sanctions against Russia
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia in an interview with the Economic messages.
Russia's political priority is to promote its own interests.
The sanctions may not work on this," Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started work as a business liquidator for the Arctic regions of the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK).
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended their project funding in Russia as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
"It means, for example, that environmental projects in the Northern Dimension with clear prospects go into ice," Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of funds is now hampering cooperation, which Lipponen says can be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region will continue to be as great as before.
He is currently conducting an EK study on Finland's Arctic policy and business opportunities in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or by the situation in Russia.
The report looks a long way forward, we talk about tens of years," he says.
It is rare that the Norppa comes into low water or close to the population," says nature pedagog Vesa Heinonen from the lecture centre of the Museum of Ostrobothnia.
On Sunday there was a noose swimming near the beach in Suvilahti in Vaasa.
According to Heinonen, the Norppa is likely to have come to Suvilahti for food.
It's not messed up.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen tips.
According to him, for example, the Sundom Bridge sees Norwegians, especially in the spring and autumn, who arrive specifically after the fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the Vaasa Sea Area.
On the pay-per-view, we see novels in the villas, he continues.
The Norp lives in the Bothnian Sea and Archipelago Sea, among other things.
According to the South Australian court, the murdered pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the nightclub.
Murdered South Australian pizza owner Robert Vallelonga.
The court hearing has revealed that the pizza owner, Robert Vallelonga, behaved aggressively against both his partner and the security officer only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers of the accused of killing Vallelonga asked Adelaide before the lower court for the release of their client's bail because it was 'clearly' self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep her client, whose identity has not been released, behind bars until the trial.
"According to the evidence, the deceased behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, a dud started, and as a result, this 40-year-old drunk man -- ripped the security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, death was caused by one stroke, which clearly suggests self-defense or defence of the other.
For the time being, a 25-year-old man is still being accused of murder.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the intersection of Rundle St and Synagogue Place at about 2.25 p.m. on May 4th, with severe head injuries.
He died of his injuries at Adelaide Royal Hospital early the next day, leaving friends and pizzeria's customers to mourn the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
According to prosecutors, there was no reason to kill the accused, and after the incident he had told the taxi driver that he had “put someone to bed for a few days”.
But the video footage from the security camera proves something else now, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the deceased behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his share of hard and violent behavior," he says.
On our client's side there is both the presumption of innocence and the evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors objected to the release of the man because only one of the three security officers on the scene on the night of the accident had interfered with the behaviour of the Vallelonga.
According to them, other security guards didn't think he was threatening because he was "short," and he used a big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They said that a taxi driver who clearly saw the case would also prove that Vallelonga was hit with "powerful" and had no chance of defending himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week when she announced her decision.
In Japan, the controversial dolphins began - as a tradition - Foreign news - Evening Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to postpone the start of the world’s widely disapproved hunt.
The Japanese town of Taiji started the annual dolphin hunting season again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
There is great opposition to a yacht from around the world, including the British newspaper Guardia.
In the hunt, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote bay, where mammals are slaughtered after the selection of the most suitable individuals to be transported to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
Dolphin meat also ends up as food.
However, according to local authorities, the start of hunting was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
Information about the practice spread to the world through a documentary on the subject The Cove in 2009.
During the previous hunting season the hunt has been criticised not only by animal protectors but also by diplomats.
According to the opponents, in any case, dolphin meat has a limited market due to its high mercury content.
According to the defenders of hunting, including the Japanese Government, this is a tradition.
The defenders have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
During the weekend, there were protests against the dolphins in several countries with demonstrations.
According to protesters in Tokyo, the hunt damages Japan’s reputation in the world.
A demonstration was also held in front of the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki on Monday.
Part of NATO's Member States are uncertain about the deployment of new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, the views are divided as to whether NATO bases should be established in Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries in response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military alliance to bring in permanent troops, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russian politics and threatens to overthrow European security," said Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London.
NATO Member States will be here in the week beginning, and the military alliance is due to announce its new contingency plan.
The central question of the plan is whether NATO can violate the Convention on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
In this, NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed on how to deploy armed forces in the Atlantic/Ural Mountain region.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltics.
Russia itself suspended its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not exactly withdraw from the agreement.
In view of the tense situation in Ukraine, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be respected.
"Nato's resources must be in all NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind, Chairman of the Security Committee of the British Parliament, to the Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller, the youngest man to fly around the world.
When other teenagers learned to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
19-year-old Guthmiller just became the youngest flying around the world – and even alone, reported CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A youth living in the state of South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries on five continents.
On his way to Guthmiller, he was treated like a rock star because of his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Too risky" and "Some spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun."
Guthmiller did not have much to say to the authors of such comments.
Of course I had a lot of fun, but it also involved a lot of work, and I hope that my record will inspire other people to go out and do great things.
Guthmiller started his flight at a young age, and first he asked his parents to eat at the airport cafes.
Later, he insisted on taking flight lessons.
My parents let me go on a short 20-minute tour flight, but I think they thought at the time that my enthusiasm would stop.
He didn't stop.
Soon thereafter, Guthmiller concluded a contract with his parents to give him more time in the cockpit.
I agreed to share a car with my father throughout high school instead of getting my own car.
In exchange, I could fly airplanes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a pilot's licence and two years later he leased a single-engined Beechcraft for his solo flight around the world.
A young man who studied at MIT University took care of the aircraft himself and made the fuel calculations.
Many hours in the air also meant that he himself needed more refueling —
In practice, a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he ate a few cookie sticks all over a long flight.
Flying into the clouds was both wonderful and frightening.
Air traffic controllers in other countries had no weather radar to help them navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which of the clouds rose just a little above the plane and which of them reached a height of 45 000 feet and would tear the plane apart.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurized and had no oxygen supply, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The amount of fuel in the plane would not have reached a higher level.
The day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after his plane crashed on the American flight between Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls the most difficult part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he feels that the rise stage is technically challenging due to the large amount of fuel needed for a 16-hour flight.
However, despite the risks and even the fear of a high place, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for IT training through the Code.org website.
He's a coder himself, and he started his own business at 12 years of age.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
It would be great to set up the next Apple, but now let's see how it goes.
Guthmiller's going to aim high anyway.
Aim for the sky and you can accomplish something great.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was thrilled by fans waiting in line for her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores all over Canada after Canada’s W-TV channel began to show The Cupcake Girls live TV show in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was not suitable for the task.
"My French entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers are waiting outside the store ready to buy a cupcake, and he can't handle the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge missed opportunity for us.
After what happened, Joyce decided to change the selection process for franchise partners, starting with emphasis on the company's cultural leadership skills instead of baking skills.
"Anyone can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he has had about 100 interviews for each 11 franchises.
We start with six weeks of training, but employees work in a completely different way in the working environment itself, so the whole process is quite difficult. This is why education in Finland emphasises above all the suitability of a business culture.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is vital for the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader is able to shape and grow the organization, while a poorly-suited manager can cause costly damage to the company.
"Before I thought that looking for a franchise entrepreneur is like dating, but it's not at all true," Joyce says, "you can do a lot to get to know someone before you get married."
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a valid agreement will be signed, a guarantee will be obtained and a new store will be built.
Getting into a partnership with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and a significant test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the Franchise parties is similar to a strong marriage, as they share common goals, explained by Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA) and Managing Director.
That is why Mr McLachlan also believes that the franchise entrepreneur should be careful when choosing the future franchise provider before engaging in such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as relationships: if a date is rude on a date already, imagine what she's like in a marriage," she says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and evaluate the future contractor and to pay attention to the smallest alarm signs on either side.
McLachlan adds that franchise providers such as Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time those who give franchises must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
New franchise providers, on the other hand, will have to conclude, presumably on the basis of a successful parent company, what challenges they have had to face and what skills a new franchise entrepreneur needs when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, franchise companies may also request the assistance of franchise advisors in order to create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also points out that, for the first time, there is a great deal of help available on the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later because franchise providers will learn to assess potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchise entrepreneurs will be able to provide advice and help in the assessment.
"The work input of the first franchise partner helped Brian (founder and CEO of Scudamore 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly in the creation of the company and the franchise system," says Erik Church, O2E Brands Executive Director. O2E Brands includes 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he could not have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Under Church there are 216 franchise entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a franchise partner of You Move Me, Toronto.
Chruch's method for finding the right franchise partner is simple.
"One of the confidence tests we have is to ask ourselves, 'Would I invite this person to my house for the weekend barbecue?' he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'no', you probably do not want to spend much of your day looking with them for solutions to major business challenges."
Church further notes that O2E Brands is largely to thank its franchise structure for its success.
In a business organisation, managers often see their own position as short-term and the relationship with the lower management level as very formal, while franchise entrepreneurs enter into a partnership with long-term goals and thus become more committed to the success of the company.
"There are many more advantages in the French partnership compared to the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intensive," he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the vice-president and the local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but if managed well, it will produce better results.
Delays in the railways reduce grain prices in the north of the United States
Delayed train transport has led to a significant fall in grain prices in the northern central parts of the United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to put under new pressure from the transport network.
Commercial grain silos in the state of North Dakota offer farmers only $2.7 per bushel - about a dollar less than the control prices - mainly because of the cost of securing rail capacity on the receiving trains, says traders and farming organisations.
IN Raw materials
The most acute problems are the BNSF railways of Warren Buffetin Berkshire Hathaway and the Canadian Pacific Railways.
The Federal Railway Supervisor will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
The northern plains have to resort to railways for the transport of agricultural products, because they are far from river networks.
Delays in train transport increased as the heavy harvest of 2013 was followed by a very cold winter that caused delays and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of crude oil from the North Dakota Bakken oil shale formation has replaced the transport of cereals, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to a manager of an international cereal trading company, the cost of ensuring the use of the train by grain sellers has risen from zero to between $2,000 and $3,000 per wagon per year.
Somebody's got to pay for it.
"These costs will be borne by either the farmer or the customer", says the manager of the grain trading company.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota’s soy bean crop will grow by more than a third and spring crop by 16%.
Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that "normally we are trying to start a new harvest on a clean table, meaning that sufficient storage space has been emptied for the harvest and the grain has been sold and moved.
Now, however, we start late because of the service problems of trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this year's harvest smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President responsible for the transport of BNSF's agricultural products, said that the company has reduced the amount of prolonged transport (customs-ordered railway wagons, which took more than four days to deliver) from the peak at the beginning of April, 16 500, to about two thousand.
"We've moved almost everything from the old crop we were supposed to move," Miller says, referring to the grain that was left over from the previous harvest.
However, the latest reported speeds of BNSF’s grain trains were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Mr Miller admits that the development is 'uneven' but pointed out that the company is currently investing USD 5 billion in capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all types of transported products, such as grain peaks.
The trains of the Canadian Pacific railway company, which suffered from problems due to the second suma, are 11 per cent lower than the same time last year, but clearly higher than the much lower speeds of the first year.
The Canadian Pacific railway company has told the railway supervisor (Surface Transport Board) that the changes made to its rail wagon order system should improve its ability to handle transport by 15-20% in the coming harvest season.
"The action plan for the Canadian Pacific railway company in autumn focuses on continuous improvement of train speed and efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more railway wagons every week," said the representative of the railway company.
The crisis in Ukraine may solve the NATO 'identity crisis'
The leaders, diplomats and experts of the large countries have often expressed concerns about the future of NATO and whether the end of NATO's mission to Afghanistan will also mean the end of NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is evident from the NATO summit in Cardiff, Wales this week, with 60 leaders, including the US President Barack Obama.
There is no shortage of world crises on the agenda of politicians and diplomats, even to the extent that the departure of Afghan troops, which was once a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
Instead, a 28-state alliance is needed after Russia has re-entered Ukraine, which is a shocking reminder that threatening Europe's independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defence spending and re-engage in defence cooperation.
In some ways, NATO must thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) looked for its purpose in some way -- and it was in the midst of a rather significant identity crisis," says Heather Conley, Director of the European Programme of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose but has also strengthened itself.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to come up with a common strategy to bring down the rapidly winning Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face major challenges in trying to inspire his war-satisfying partners into a military response, especially one that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy to defeat extremist Islamists, after stating directly that 'we do not have a strategy'.
Western experts have set cautious expectations for the summit as to whether breakthroughs will be achieved in Ukraine or in the Islamic State.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main punishment for an event called the Russian invasion by Ukraine.
Officials of the European Union dealt with this issue this weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries that Obama wishes to see as the main partners in the Islamist problem are not necessarily NATO members.
The accumulation of problems could not be foreseen two years ago when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, where the debate was dominated by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Robert M. Gates, the then leader, used his last speech to say that the organisation has almost reached the point of 'common military insignificance'.
Officials in the United States constantly complained that other countries did not reach their financial targets.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence spending, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this goal last year.
Now, however, officials of the White House say that they have noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff promising to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time there is a genuine desire for the company, as Member States see potential threats in their real size.
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Federation's "defence promises are more significant and more important than ever after the end of the Cold War", says Charles Kupcha, President of the United States National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach a consensus among 28 Member States.
Obama will spend much of his trip strengthening his commitment to defence cooperation in favour of Russia’s concerned neighbouring countries.
The President will begin his three-day trip to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has been recycling its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when a new contingency plan, to be published this week, is introduced.
The plan aims to shorten the time NATO needs to respond to attacks in border states, officials say.
The plan includes the addition of air surveillance and other visible signs of defence cooperation.
The changes present a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe as a sign of kindness to Russia.
According to officials, the new plan does not actually violate the agreement, but it may also be a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to be named in the debate before the official announcement.
NATO's presence will probably be described as long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Putin has a powerful "winter" - does he use it in Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace up his sleeve with regard to Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in Eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops to Ukrainian soil.
That is why the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
When the situation in Ukraine is tense, the Western countries are planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, has a trump card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main energy source is Russia.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine’s primary energy sources are natural gas (40 percent) and coal (28 percent), Geysar Gurbanov of Harvard University writes according to Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine in less than four months and coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country’s conflict, the Ukrainians will freeze in their homes when the supply of gas from Russia stops.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will help Putin win the war in the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
On 16 July, Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine's contracted gas debt by 1 August amounted to USD 5.3 billion (about EUR 4 billion).
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think no one will think about it (winter) anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways of facilitating the resolution of the matter.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to rebuild stocks, necessary repairs must be made and the cold season prepared.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a disguised threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company in Nomura, pointed out last month that Russia's talks on humanitarian intervention and the planning of a possible new gas crisis in Ukraine will intensify in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activity until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay for the gas supplies in advance if Kiev does not start paying the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement allowing gas imports to continue on a temporary basis.
Last week the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Arsen Jatsenjuk, said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies to EU countries in the winter.
Later, the Russian Minister for Energy, Aleksandr Novak, told us that the speeches were false.
He said that Russia will do everything in its power to deliver gas to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi blogger was sentenced to 10 years in prison and a thousand lashes.
The Saudi court has upheld the ten-year prison sentence imposed on Raif Badaw, who founded the liberal Free Saudi Liberals in May.
The sentence includes a further penalty of one thousand lashes and one million rials (about EUR 200 000).
The judgment was based on the fact that he had set up a website that degrades Islam.
On Monday, AFP was informed of the judgment by Suad al-Shamari, the founder of the organisation.
Badawi himself has been in custody since 2012.
In July 2013, Badawi was sentenced to seven years in jail and 600 lashes, but the sentence was appealed and re-opened.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Rantala's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the revolutionary human encounters"
Madventures today released a new book entitled World Explanation - The Adventurer's Explanation for Everything.
We asked Riku Ranta about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also tells of the most significant human encounter in his life.
Writer, journalist, Madventures' other party Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today a new book has been published, yesterday there was a movie picnic at Civic Market and Wednesday begins the second production season of the Docventures.
Since this morning, he's been running from place to place.
From Maukkari's morning TV to take the child to the day care centre and then to a weekly meeting.
The face-to-face interview must be transferred to a telephone interview.
That's the only way we're gonna make it.
In the middle of all the rush he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write the World Explanation book, which, according to the cover of the book, is an adventurer's handbook for everything.
Everything?
Wow, that's a lot promised.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture is doing worse than another, why we are here and who we really are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book’s experts include both professors and artists.
We worked actively on the book for about a year," Riku tells IS on the phone.
You've taken a pretty big piece of the book.
What is the main message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and the big questions is worth considering, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the idea of the book is to have good travel reading, but it is also meant to get people at home to talk and share ideas.
The discussion can even lead to action," Riku says.

One of the themes in your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We came to the conclusion that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the earth, we have to believe that at some point we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The earth is a sort of alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, then there can be a change, Riku Philosophy.
Riku says that some studies show that Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This leads to the conclusion that once we have enough money and our basic needs have been satisfied, we will be happy.
Money does not add to happiness.
We want to raise people to discuss what is enough.
Exploiting our natural resources will not last much longer, Riku says.
In your book, you also reflect on cultural differences.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish person?
There's not much difference between people.
Of course, the starting points for education, health care and hygiene are different.
The biggest cultural difference is that the importance of the community is much greater in India for both good and bad.
Once the Western countries are prosperous, people will live more alone.
Isolate ourselves and may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we found the right balance between community and being alone, we would be pretty close to luck,” Riku says.
Riku has met a lot of different people around the world.
What human encounter has best come into his mind?
It takes place in my childhood, when I was with my family on my first larger trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was working for the UN.
I was seven years old and two of my younger siblings were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku is laying the groundwork.
They came home to Finland with a big moving car.
We drove a war-torn Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the side of the road.
A girl my age walked on the road, carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big Mercedes bench with a Coke cap in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A child of your age will understand the situation.
It was one of the revolutionary human encounters that I will always remember.

Riku and Tunna at the book fair in 2013.
Then Riku went into the cabbage that other people must be respected, even if they are much poorer or if they do not have the same conditions of life as we do.
At that time, Riku realized that money cannot be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adulthood to the surface, people in New Guinea come up.
I couldn’t stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials to their advantage in everything, little money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me wonder.
And he wants to think about it with Tunna and get the readers of his new book.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, watch and listen more.
That it would make people act from warm sex to conversation or even fistfight, Riku throws.
Kauhajoki magazine tells us about it.
The events started when the couple arrived at the station by bus and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi took off, the man in the yard threw an object after the taxi.
The driver got out of the car, so did the man who was a passenger.
The man who threw the object stabbed a male passenger in the head and in the hand and left the scene.
The knife is a 170-175-cent thick, short-haired man.
According to the paper, there has been a young, blond ponytailed woman in the vicinity of the scene.
They're hoping he'll contact the police.
The police are also asking for clues from all those who may have observed events or persons involved in the case.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday, August 27, at 7:50 p.m.
"Hi!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first "telepathic" message passed through the Internet
The scientific publication PLoS ONE has published an article that says that the international team of researchers has been the first to convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages to be sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", in Spanish and Italian "hi".
In the test arrangement, the electro-brain curve of the sender test subject was monitored.
The sender was trained to send bits by thinking about either hand or foot movement.
The imagination of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands as one.
This bit coded information was sent through the Internet to the recipient.
The receiver was subjected to magnetic stimulation to an observation of a flash of light for every bit encoded to be number one.
The recipient was taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still an area of research in their infancy, but believe that computer assisted telepathic communication will be routine in the near future for mankind.
Sanctions - Punkti - Rural Future
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia is at war in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics action follows a reaction, act countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be effective in the long term.
Iran was not allowed to enter into negotiations on its nuclear programme until after years.
For decades, the South African racial oppression regime was sitting still, even though trade was banned by UN decisions.
Sanctions have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to export state-of-the-art electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world page.
The last time the wood was used was to freeze the sale of raw wood.
It is clear that sanctions will not bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times, and Viola's disappearance from the store doesn't cause panic.
When the EU is going to ban imports of vodka from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians would love to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The main disadvantage for Russia is not the drop in imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
The greatest harm comes from restrictions in the financial sector.
They're only gonna work in the future.
The Russian state cannot operate on the international loan market.
It has to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Even though Russia has huge reserves, they will not last forever.
The credit supply of Russian companies is waning and the money is increasing.
My own banks are not able to finance everyone.
You have to print more money or you have trouble paying companies.
Bankruptcy is also a bankruptcy in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, the Russian modernisation will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsingin Sanomat.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Gradually, Russia would return to Russia once again and curl inwards.
An exceptional wrestling event took place in North Korea
Some 10,000 North Koreans, along with a number of diplomats, followed the international free wrestling matches held in Pyongyang, the capital, on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki, a lawyer who became a free wrestler, took part in an event organised by a Japanese man named Antonio Inoki, who was a wrestler from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil, and Mexico.
In addition to free wrestling matches, Taekwondo matches were also seen for local athletes.
According to Inoki, the aim of the event was to bring the countries of conflict closer together and to promote world peace through sport.
In their speeches, politicians hoped for a better relationship between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan lifted sanctions imposed on North Korea as a result of the Japanese abductions in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, for its part, promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
Most recently, international wrestling was seen in North Korea in 1995.
The SOK reduces the organisation of the grocery trade by approximately 110 people.
The Yt negotiations started in June when the reduction was estimated to be no more than 130.
According to the company, its organisation has now been dismantled and its responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK says that it is looking for clearly better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the economic downturn and the fall in consumer demand, there is a structural change in trade, which has shaken the trade in goods, in particular.
The result of the S Group's utility trade has been at a loss for some time.
The Yt negotiations concerned all employees and management of the SOK's grocery trade, i.e. approximately 530 persons.
Turun Sanomat: Part of the self-care medication behind the counter
According to the magazine, there are more medicines between prescription drugs and medicines taken from the shelf itself that you would receive without a prescription, but only after advice from a pharmacy worker.
According to the Finnish Association of Pharmacies, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could come under advice.
After an interview with a pharmacist or pharmacist and when the predefined criteria are met, the medicine should be administered behind the counter, says Kirsi Kvarnström, Chairman of the Association of Pharmacies, in Turun Sanomat.
There are already a few medicines in Finland that need advice without a prescription.
One of these is an emergency contraceptive.
Corruption for a more specific reason
Finland pays more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, because the world is amazed at the low level of bribery cases and convictions in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice’s working group will consider whether sections of the Criminal Code would be needed for the trading and abuse of influence.
For example, differences in legislation emerged during the trial of Patria’s bribery case in the Slovenian branch in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
In Slovenia, trading influence brought a two-year sentence of imprisonment to the former Prime Minister, but Finnish law does not know the corresponding criminal code.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to a recent survey, corruption is hardly investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now commissioned a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police University of Applied Sciences on the vulnerability of corruption in various fields.

The Wanderers are in Dubai in a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendship matches in Abu Dhabi, so that the team can prepare for the first semi-final match on September 17th.
With too many yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole will miss the trip to Korea, but Coach Popovic believes in their replacements.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players at ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned in China for this gesture.
After all, it is a setback, not one of the players should be gone, but we did not have Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in, he must have worked a lot, and I'm counting on the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play anyone at the semifinals.
The Wanderers also have to be without Spiranovic, which is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The defenseman of the Socrates team was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued running, and it is possible that he will play in the return game at Pirtek Stadium on October 1st.
"He's back in his career and he's recovering well," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him because it means gradually going back to the field.
He's already been practicing a couple of times outside, which is good.
It'll be a while before he's all right, but he'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has world-class facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also feels that the trip to Dubai is a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the big changes at the end of last season.
“We know that this will certainly help players to create bonds,” Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both in the field and outside.
So we take advantage of the camp for many purposes.
Elitisburger pays three times the worker’s monthly salary
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to belong to the elite of the country.
The economics torn apart by contrast are reported by the Financial Times.
In North Korea, the informal market is perhaps flourishing more than ever.
They offer wealthy or thrifty ordinary citizens luxury that has not been used to uniting with a dictatorship.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: the amusement center, where a mere ticket costs as much as ten months of the average worker’s salary.
There's burgers in this place that cost $76.
That's three to five months' pay to a regular job in the country.
At the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea's "western market" began in the 1990s, when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of supplies can be gross at worst.
Yet, in Pyongyang, the capital, many have a cell phone with an ovh of $200.
Part of the reason may be the ruler of Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create an energetic and youthful image of himself.
In his time, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the country’s prosperity.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council with a hopeful view of sales
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that cost taxpayers almost £3,000 a week.
The Council bought a 19th-century building in the eastern part of the city 13 years ago and paid nine million pounds for it.
The Council failed to sell the building further, when the security and maintenance of the building cost the Council some £400 a day.
The building was sold recently for £1.25 million.
Apparently, the building will be used as a private residential building.
In 2001, the Council purchased a B-class building of historical value for £9 million because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was resold at a price of £2.5 million this time.
The building could not be sold, and the price was lowered.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt of the Ulster Unionist party suggested that Ormiston House might fit into a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it is negotiating the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate agent remain silent on the buyer’s identity and sale price.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormiston House are about £3,000.
The Council bought a building from the police force, which preceded the Northern Ireland Police Board.
The security costs of Ormiston House by the beginning of this year amounted to GBP 885 641 and maintenance costs to GBP 371 379.
The price of professional repair and maintenance services was GBP 250 015 and the fees for development and design professionals were GBP 212 466.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887 when it was purchased by Harland's business partner William Pirrie. Pirrie later became Chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building and sold it to Campbell College in 1928, which held it until the mid-70s.
"Differentness is increasing": Helsinki plans to reduce school assistants
There will be no savings, says JHL.
In Helsinki, a radical reduction in the number of school-based school assistants is being prepared.
The deduction would not apply to the child’s personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Education Board decided to present a total of some 2.7 million deductions from the resources of school assistants.
There are about 600 schooling assistants in Helsinki.
If the contractions occur, they will enter into force during the semester immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to the trade union JHL, the decision increases inequality.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunately easy to reduce assistants for reasons of savings because the amount of support for learning is not clearly defined by law.
There will certainly be no savings; on the contrary, the workload of teaching staff will increase.
For schoolchildren, savings pose an increased risk of falling from learning goals, and the ability of teachers to cope is hard," says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Director of Industry at JHL.
The plans of the City of Helsinki discriminate between schools, because with future resources, small schools and students who need support will no longer receive the assistance resources at all.
The aim of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
Effective preventive work is done by school assistants.
However, the adjustment measures of the National Education Agency are mostly targeted at this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
The final decision on the resources will be made in the autumn by the City Council of Helsinki, for whom I hope to have a vision and wisdom to look to the future and to act in accordance with its objectives," says Niemi-Laine.
Israel Powers the Land on the West Bank
Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement called Gevaot in the Etzion settlement near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel occupied nearly 400 hectares of land in the Jewish settlement on the West Bank, near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the region, and at the same time defies the Palestinians’ request not to build more settlements and defy the public opinion of the world community.
The Israeli 'Peace Now' group, which is opposed to the expansion of settlements on the West Bank, felt that Sunday events could be the biggest single invasion of the country in the West Bank region for decades and could ' dramatically change the situation in the region'.
The Palestinians aim to establish their own country in the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political impulse to assess the situation in the land areas came after three Israeli youths were kidnapped and killed in June after hitchhiking in the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the main perpetrator of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the invasion of the land suggests that it was intended as a kind of compensation for the population of settlement and punishment for the Palestinians.
Near the Gevaot settlement of the Jews, the land in the Etzion settlement of South Jerusalem has now been officially declared "land of the state" when it used to be privately owned by the Palestinians, a necessary step for Israel to start planning buildings in the region if it wanted to.
However, Ahmad Lafi, Mayor of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, said that the country belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the official Palestinian news agency WAFA that early Sunday the Israeli army and its staff issued orders to take over the land of Surif and nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukini with olive and other trees.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people led the Israeli army to carry out a disciplinary action on the West Bank against the Islamist group that dominates Gaza, Hamas, which Israel says was behind the abductions.
The ensuing tensions on the Israeli- Gaza Strip flared up in a 50-day war that ended last week in a cease-fire in Egypt.
The invasion of the land has quickly drawn attention to the Israeli-controlled West Bank and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli Government, which make it difficult for the wider development of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process to take place.
Crisis municipalities in Lapland are usually multi-problems
An increasing number of municipalities in Lapland are experiencing problems, as is evident from the welfare research carried out by the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of crisis groups.
According to the professor, reducing municipal tasks by EUR 1 billion is not enough.
One of the common features of crisis groups is poor local government finances, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Lapland Asko Suikkanen, new crisis municipalities are coming from the western border and Eastern Lapland.
In the survey, the population assessed the situation in their municipality in a very realistic way.
In the survey, residents of well - performing municipalities even viewed the outlook pessimistically.
Creepy expectations affect consumption.
People hope that today’s everyday life and well - being will be preserved, perhaps even a little improved.
In this time period, we do not dare to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The research group was surprised by the large differences between municipalities.
For example, the cost of income support per capita varies from a couple of tens to well over 100 euros.
The tax revenue received by the municipality per capita varies from just over EUR 2 000 in Ranua to EUR 4400 in Pelkonenniemi.
According to Sikkanen, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is spent, how much is received by the state and what is the degree of indebtedness differs a lot in similar municipalities, he says.

Britain may close borders with returning Islamist fighters
Britain may temporarily impede the return of Islamic fighters from Iraq and Syria.
The BBC tells us about it, referring to government sources.
However, according to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism could retain their nationality.
According to the government source, this is one of many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is being finalised and is to be presented by Prime Minister David Cameron.
The government is also looking for ways to make it more difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they can temporarily confiscate passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr rejoices at the immediate release of Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from Libyan prison
An Australian lawyer, Melinda Taylor, is expected to be released from Libyan prison today.
The federal government was delighted with the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
The representative of Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that 'everything is going well' and the attorney of the International Criminal Court will be released to the Australian authorities this evening, and then he will be on a plane to Europe by midnight.
"We are delighted with the news that he is likely to be released today," the representative commented on the matter to the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for its help and support," said the representative.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before the journey to her home in The Hague.
On 7 June Taylor and his three colleagues in the criminal court were arrested in the Libyan city of Zintani, representing Seif al-Islam, son of Muammar Qadhafi, former Libyan dictator.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took documents to Seif that they felt threatened national security.
Senator Carr has gone to great lengths to free Taylor, including to travel to Tripoli, Libya's capital, last month to pursue this cause.
Taylor couldn't talk to her husband or her little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a short call to his home in The Hague shortly after the visit of the Australian ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with Taylor’s parents in Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor’s parents had appealed to Libya to release their daughter before her third birthday in July.
Three other detainees are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
A week ago, Mr Carr said that, following a debate between the lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, 'the criminal court lawyer was sorry and apologized for any misunderstanding'.
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to investigate the activities of its team thoroughly after its members return home.
"After the International Criminal Court has closed its investigation, it will ensure that all those who have done wrong will be properly judged", the Court announced in its press release last month.
The International Criminal Court is demanding a trial for 39-year-old Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which ended unexpectedly last year.
According to Mr Tripoli, his trial should be local and took an initiative on 1 May in which it announced that it would not accept the decision of the criminal court lawyer to hold the trial in The Hague.
A young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took its second victory in the early stages of the Spanish football league, but it was easy not for Villarreal to fall in his home.
The blue-reds were pushing their heads into the Villarreal Guard Sergio Asenjoe until the 82nd minute finally succeeded.
The winner was a surprising man: 19-year-old attacker Sandro Ramirez, who made his first appearance in La Liga, had only come to the airport 12 minutes earlier.
The young man who received the invitation from the second team in Barcelona finished close by when Asenjo had rejected Lionel Messi’s company.
The collections to Ferguson's police mysteriously ended after over $433,000.
The administrators closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after the collection of over $400,000 to the police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
On the GoFundMe charity site, open to the general public, two separate pages carrying similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – have raised $235 750 and $197 620 for a Fergusonian police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar web site maintained by Brown’s family’s lawyer had raised $314 099 since Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by several weeks of unrest and demonstrations against the nearly white police force of Ferguson, mostly inhabited by blacks, forcing Wilson to hide while local and federal investigations attempt to determine whether he shot Brown for no reason.
Network collection campaigns have given rise to a certain amount of fuss about Wilson’s defence, especially since some visitors had written racist comments in the comment section, which have since been deleted.
Both pages apparently stopped accepting donations at about the same time on Saturday, and the site administrators gave no reason to do so.
When a visitor tries to make a donation, he sees a message saying, "Donations are no longer accepted!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe site gave a note to the Los Angeles Times that the site has not prevented donations from being made.
"Every organizer of the GoFundMe campaign decides for himself when he wants to stop accepting donations," said Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website.
The organisers may also continue to receive donations at a later date if they so wish.
The Support Officer Wilson page, with a proceeds of $197,620, is maintained by the Saint Louis Police Charity Group Shield of Hope, a recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe website.
On Sunday, three police officers Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, registered as official representatives of the Shield of Hope Land Collection Register, did not respond to e-mails requesting further information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official spokesperson of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the nearby Florissant City Council and member of the Roorda Missouri Chamber of Representatives.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the Support Officer Darren Wilson page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected $235 750. He has not been confirmed as a recipient of donations approved by the site.
However, a representative of the GoFundMe site assured The Times that an anonymous benefactor exists.
In contrast to the administrators of another Wilson page or Brown donation site, little information has been given to donors about the anonymous benefactor in the collection campaign.
Two weeks ago, an anonymous Wilson site benefactor wrote a message to visitors that the site cooperates with the Shield of Hope Group in order to become an officially accepted recipient of donations.
Approval has not yet been granted.
The benefactor provided visitors with additional information with an aliased Gmail address, but did not respond immediately on Sunday to a request for more information.
In a press release to The Times, a representative of the GoFundMe page said that the anonymous collection page had been removed from the search results of the main site and added that "the campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe website to have a functional Facebook account".
In the information security policies of the GoFundMe website, users are encouraged to "give only to GoFundMe users whom they personally know and trust".
Unfortunately, there is no firm guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe site is accurate and honest.
According to Congressman Little, GoFundMe has, however, "been in contact with the campaign organizer and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds raised if there is a need to start an investigation in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to reserve the funds raised by the campaign in question.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organized campaigns to support Wilson, told its followers this weekend that lawyers are trying to find "explanation", why donors from the GoFundMe site have been prevented from donating, but the site did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on Facebook page and these comments have not been confirmed by an independent source.
Arsenal's top attacker for the rest of the year - Champion League - Evening Sanomat
Olivier Giroud, the French attacker of the British Champion League Arsenal, is likely to be on the sidelines until the turn of the year.
Giroud's ankle was cut on Wednesday and it'll take months to recover.
Giroud hurt his leg this weekend at the Champion League fight against Everton.
The operation went well, but he is on the sidelines until he is able to play at the top level, until the end of December or until the beginning of January," Arsenal's head coach Arsene Wenger said to Sky Sports.
Last season Giroud was Arsenal's best scorer with 16 hits, so the loss is considerable.
However, according to Wenger, he may no longer acquire a patch for Giroud during this transfer window.
Wenger played fresh acquisitions at the top of Alexis Sanchez on Wednesday in the Champions League finals against Besiktas.
Arsenal won 1-0 with Sanchez's goal.
There's a lot of Hollywood celebrity naked photos going around the Internet, and there's a suspicion of hacking.
On Sunday, pictures of several public figures claimed to be naked were circulating on social media.
The pictures included an Oscar-winning actor Jennifer Lawrence and pop star Rihanna.
According to the U.S. media, the images are suspected of being hacked extensively.
According to the media, the photos were stolen from Apple's iCloud cloud service accounts.
"It's really weird and hard when privacy is taken away," Lawrence tweeted.
According to the media, there was also an actor and a model Jenny McCarthy, a reality TV performer Kim Kardashian, and a singer and actor Avril Lavigne.
According to an actor and pop star Ariana Grande's publicist, the pictures that she's supposed to be in are fakes.
That's what singer Victoria Justice said.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead, an actor in horror movies, said that the intimate pictures published about her were years old.
Keskisuomalainen: Finns rely on the security of online banks
The majority of Finns rely on the security of online banks, reports the Keskisuomalainen.
According to a survey conducted by the newspaper, four out of five consider the security of online banks to be good.
The age of the respondents is clear in the answers.
Young people believe the most in the security of online banks, least of all pensioners.
Tuula Sario, the leading lawyer of the Consumer Union, is not surprised by the views.
Those who use a lot of the Internet usually rely most on its services.
However, those who do not use the services are ignorant and suspicious, he ponders in Central Finland.
Most Finns are customers of an online bank.
The most common business is using a computer, but the use of mobile devices is becoming more common.
In August, a thousand Finns answered the questionnaire of Tietoykkönen Oy.
The margin of error is three percentage points.
Jens Lapidus and Bridge series scriptwriter to do a series of crimes together
Jens Lapidus, one of Sweden's most famous crime writers, and Hans Rosenfeldt, a writer who has written the popular Silta series, are working together to prepare a new TV series.
The descriptions of the ten-piece Advokaten series are due to begin next year.
The Swedish production company Tre Vänner reported on the project on Monday in a press release.
The series was bought by Swedish TV4.
The third author of the series is Michael Hjort.
Advokaten, located in Stockholm, tells of a young lawyer named Frank who, in one case, finds dark connections between his own family and notorious criminal groups.
Lapidus, a criminal writer who has gained a reputation in a money-for-money novel, is a defense lawyer in his civil profession.
