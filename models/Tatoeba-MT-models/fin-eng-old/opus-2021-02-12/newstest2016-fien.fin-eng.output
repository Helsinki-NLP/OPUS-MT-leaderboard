Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy on a flight to Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing persons report on a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread in social media.
According to the Police Situation Center, the boy has been contacted and is not in danger of life and health.
The boy's father told the Evening Sanomat at midnight that he was found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the after-party.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, the father told me.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, ravingly... tore up the paint gap with Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued his work in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the goal kingship of the Champions League turned for at least a moment to the advantage of the latter.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo went to the top of the all-time scorer statistics alone when he shot a visitor on Shahtar Donetski’s network with two hits from the penalty kicks and one from the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80 when, before Tuesday, Barcelona Messi, who was about to level with him, has 77 hits.
Real won the game four-fifty.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian football league in Serie A from the early season, but in the Champions League’s Pool D it began with a powerful 2-1 guest victory in Manchester City.
The goal was scored more than ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who had a knee problem.
Aguero didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes of the weekend.
In the Netherlands, the second Manchester club United also suffered severe losses against PSV Endhoven after losing 1-2.
ManU's 20-year-old wingman, Luke Shaw, had only 15 minutes to make it.
The dangerously-looking slipshot of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the ManU box that attacked the target so badly that Shaw probably cracked his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium about ten minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests 41 minutes to the 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno did it before the break with extra time.
In the second half, the PSV was scored by Luciano Narsingh.
The goalmaking season in the Champions League began with the Paris Saint-Germain of Pool A.
It was Angel Di Maria from Argentine who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball past the back corner of Malmö goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for the other half-time PSG.
The PSG has been put on the line for the season's success.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the small league clubs, is not the best benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the PSG star attacker, first encountered Malmö FF, his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow, TsSKA, lost a B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president made the wrong speech
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech again in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirit.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place at Mugabe’s headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech dealt with the impact of China on the economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively those coming to Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the table of the Home Affairs Ministers.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during the 911 call.
It's just a little vibrating university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the 911 call that he shot his girlfriend and that the cops have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" was alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the dead woman's next of kin could be found on his phone.
Inside the house, the police found a handwritten message written on Amy Prentiss's body and the notebook's page: "I'm so sorry I could cancel this love for Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said a letter that experts say was signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believe he shot and killed the teacher of the held history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
The police chief at Delta State University, Lynn Buford, said that the university staff heard a shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the voice.
The authorities were still trying to find out Lamb’s motive the day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published reports that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher who, however, may have had problems.
The students told me they'd been waiting for her hours.
The police at the location of Prentiss' death, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised the Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and uneasy, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told us that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
William LaForge, president of the university, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind".
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb escaped campus, the police managed to track him back to Mississippi, Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents’ house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, reported Methel Johnson, Washington County coroner.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with approximately 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb graduated in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer back then.
All the girls were melted wax when she was there, now told me a 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the suburbs of Jackson, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
On the 911 call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, told me they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both present in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together on some gigs.
O'Steen told me his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainer at The Julep Room near Gautier, says that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performances for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We made fun of each other and threw squishy things at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the seminar program for first-year students and specialized in Indians and colonial history, told school’s English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, at Delta State campus, there was a candlebrush involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the exhibition during which the university choir sang songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but the dealer of toy and baby products says that current permanent and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, compared with 45 000 people employed during the 2014 holiday period.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the occupation of shops and in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" was a moment of enormous professional importance for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that I was sitting next to them empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," he said, a documentary film coming up at Back in Time's trailer.
The movie starts and it comes to my mind that I'm just a fake yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back to the Future, which was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
A return to the future got its premiere 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "To me, it is undoubtedly the greatest time travel film ever."
Back in Time is available as an on-demand video, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved by armed means
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict 'will not be resolved by armed means', and additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced that he was going to meet the foreign ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the Ministerial Week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the solidarity and consensus they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 Support polls that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him a wind quail.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not (yet) been successful.
Of the latest 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been in charge in a two-digit number, and some have seriously begun to consider what this means for the appointment of the real estate king.
The election season is, of course, only in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that at this point in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his leadership to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom gained any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, outside groups, such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Association Club for Growth, have noted Trump’s tenacity and began to use their funds to overthrow him.
The following recent survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, the support polls at Monmouth University showed that only two Republicans out of ten welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August the figure was 52 per cent.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a support poll conducted by the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans reported that they welcome Trump.
Two thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfaction" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of the "enthusiastic" vs. Trump 40%).
What's the next thing that's gonna cause the most excitement?
Marco Rubio only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush, a popular leader of the regime, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday, 52% of Republican voters at national level think that the real estate king has a suitable character for the president.
According to a survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac, in the state of Iowa, the number is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think that Trump has a suitable character for the leader.
However, according to ABC/Post’s survey, 44 percent feel that his character is not suitable for presidentship, and nearly six out of ten feel that his character does not belong to the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who was most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
Even at the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information release: Republican voters have not always had access to the brightest crystal ball possible.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans were of the opinion that Rick Perry was nominated, and only 28 per cent were in favour of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters believe that Trump's campaign is credible.
Even if the Republicans were to stand up for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as support against Trump is divided among a number of other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's tied up with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set against each other, Ben Carson would win the business man Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Just about the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/ NOW survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided who to vote for.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that he will never change his mind.
Forty-six percent said they might be able to switch candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s pompiness is driving Latino voters away from the Republican Party and is damaging attempts to rebrand.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely because of their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in the ABC/Post poll on Monday that they prefer to select someone outside of politics rather than someone with government experience.
They're also mad at the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg on Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn’s first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
The new Labour Labour leader Jeremy Corby is facing David Cameron for the first time in the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn will rise to ask his first six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and Labour MPs will be watching his performance closely.
Corbyn has called for less theatre and more facts for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the Shadow Government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Trade Union Confederation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour leader to stand quietly during the national anthem in the memorial service on Tuesday, which took place on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain air war, has raised criticism among the Conservative MPs and has appeared in several front-page cases.
Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said that he "stowed respectfully silently" and that he acknowledged "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Owen Smith, a member of the Corbyn Shadow Board, said to the BBC Two Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he felt that the Royal House should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's inner circle, arguing for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Originally, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in policy regarding the role of the party in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have also been "accumulated" within the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
At the meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions, Mr Corbyn said that the Labour Party was proposing a change that would remove the whole roof.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow government secretary for work and pensions, said that the party was "very clear" on the fact that they were only opposed to the government's plans to reduce the ceiling from GBP 26 000 to GBP 23 000.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party that David Cameron has faced in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader has promised a new approach to politics and now tells us that he has 'supposed' ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received over 30 000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Hours is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both clever words and pricking, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that the financial secretary of the shadow government, Angela Eagle, is his substitute for Question Time when Corbyn does not participate, for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should also be allowed to speak at times, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on this matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theatre that was often associated with the Prime Minister’s Question Hours, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, Prime Minister Question Time has been an important instrument in assessing the Director's judgment, his control of the House of Commons, and his position with other Members of Parliament, even though critics have criticised the fact that they have become nothing but a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Young people without home are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate the project.

The value of the pound will rise as British wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed a rise in the UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer target SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of the rise in prices.
The pound rose to more than one per cent against $1,5505 and 0.84% against €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share in the market and increased by 20 % after its competitor AB InBev approached it with a bid.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share increased by 0.9 per cent after encouraging news from the competing luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5 percent after the mine giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were among the largest index calculators by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation to "sale".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sportswear company announced its six-month profit before taxes: an 83% increase to GBP 46.6 million.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, this could mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the company’s higher labour costs, Cowgill points out.
The costs could be related to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash is launching a grassroots campaign against the invasion of Aldi.
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA deal from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before the attack on Aldi's $700 million.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store early next year to South and Western Australia, which will have up to 120 stores. At the same time, Metcash and IGA Supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food dealers and build IGA brand via mainstream and social media marketing and events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA’s merchants and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo’s, an ice cream manufacturer from Dunsborough, offer a taste of IGA’s stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to disclose more details about its defence strategy on September 29, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and hardware organises the annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and West Australia together account for almost 30% of Metcash's IGA area, with higher margins of profit than the IGA network of Metcash's eastern Länder.
In South and West Australia, shoppers are known to be in the corner, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern countries.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi captures about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first shops.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually for sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up 30 movements in the south next year and in the west, which will generate 500 and 600 million dollars in turnover in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and amounts at Metcash's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern Länder mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales will fall by 3.8 % in 2016; 4.1 % in 2017 and 2.1 % in 2018, with its market share falling from 14 % in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash government would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has decreased from 18% to 14%, and the revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which distributes products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43 % since 2012.
However, the wholesaler stands up for himself and has invested more than $150 million a year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products each week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers renovate their stores by adding fresh food that grows faster, and bringing a better range of private brands to the market.
Metcash’s CEO Ian Morrice says that lowering prices and improving shops have increased attractiveness and hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of increasing profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian Tennis Association, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered collateral damage in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves honor rather than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, chairman of the Australian tennis federation.
The younger member of the talented duo named "Special Kse" Kokkinakis was unwittingly made public in the event of Kyrgios’ annoying Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, at a fiery qualifier game in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to separate Kokkinakis twice from his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his bat after the cramp ruined his possible victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another place in a double game with Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I think pretty strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into the mess," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost his cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he's been acting very well, including quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
She's very mature for 19 years, she works hard, fits into the team and so on, and she's never had any problems with other players. She's appreciated in the locker room, she practices hard, she's in good shape and she's quite calm and mature young man, and I think she should be judged according to her merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for all, but still supports the Canberra return to the team's standard equipment.
"We want the team to be completely focused on games and not on all the polarity around [Cyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public to reflect on these consequences.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter illegally, with the aim of damming the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border as hundreds of immigrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled the violence of their homelands have now erected their tents and settled on a roadblock between checkpoints in two countries for an indefinite time.
But frustration grew.
While the police helicopter stayed above them, immigrants kept saying, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is 'impossible to accept' the return of migrants from Hungary as they continue to arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause damage to civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The conflict on the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after the failure of the 28 national groups to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for 40 000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, who spoke with hope of reaching a final agreement - by next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an additional EU summit on Tuesday next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
Hungary does not hope, however, that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
The emergency situation on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to intervene in the crisis and enabled you to be closed down and asylum cases can be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that the fence at the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a barbed wire fence in part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing the war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not those who escape from war, who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 feet) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border against Serbia and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"In view of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency", Zoltan Kovacs, the government spokesman, told journalists in the south of the town of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still formally approve the military deployment expected for next week, but journalists at the Associated Press on the border have been seeing for days heavy-armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the Home Security Adviser of Orban, said that 45 people had been apprehended by the authorities when they tried to cross the border, and 15 who had already gone further to the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now imprisoned by the police, and they are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points at the border with Serbia after sending a rail wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of these places.
The main crossing point near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for people to process and crowds tried to intrude.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: National survey shows that the Hillary Clinton leadership to Bernie Sanders has narrowed down by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue in the double-digit run of the Democratic nominations race, but Senator Bernie Sanders will be hanging on to him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the voters of the Democrats (decreased from 58%), while the second Sanders is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will enter the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of the voters of the Democrats.
More than five months before the primary elections begin, most democrats say that it is still too early to say that they have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choice more strictly than those of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has fallen among a number of population groups since last month’s CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has increased somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only five percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start with democrat voters under 50 has disappeared, and he is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading with the older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country’s democrats say that they are enthusiastically supportive of Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
One quarter says that they support him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him simply because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
Not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who are not currently in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of the voters of the Democrats say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters (35%) say the same about Donald Trump, the number one Republican.
When people asked Clinton’s supporters why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that they had the right experience (16%), and then the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice-president has an influence on the possible presidential nomination, 57% of the democrats would like to see him in the race, even if one third disagrees.
When asked by the democrats who would be the second to choose a party, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton’s supporters, more than half say that they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, the leadership of Hilary Clinton from Sanders will grow. If Biden comes along, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he fails, the figure will be 30.
55% of democrats believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden is far away, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voter has grown.
However, when asked what was most important in the candidate, the democrats put their opinions before voting.
Last month, neither any democrats nor any possible candidacy were considered impossible candidates for these voters.
The candidates or potential candidates for democracy are doing well on certain key issues among the voters of their party.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden can do the best of the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democrats say that Clinton does not think that it is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters in general also believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When you look at all these things, about a quarter of the democrats say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server while he is Foreign Minister still raises questions, most democrats are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say that this did not affect their general opinion of him.
However, it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The public’s opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
The majority of Americans say that their overall view of Clinton was not influenced by e-mailism, although 36 percent say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although he is considered honest and reliable by the voters of Clinton's own party, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has decreased by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that they do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters in the whole country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable either.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but not many people have an opinion of him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in the study involving 351 democrats is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in a national survey.
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
In a new survey, two candidates collected half of all votes, leaving others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are increasingly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% to 27% of the last CBS survey, conducted before last month's Fox News election debate.
At the same time, however, Carson rose dramatically from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well among the different demographic groups and is taking over Trump's higher education Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasichi of Ohio. The support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin has fallen most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of florida are even in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest September survey is +/- 6%.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC survey showed Carson to be on the rise in the polls: he has 19% support for Republicans and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
Also according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey Trump was well ahead of Carson.
With Carson's popularity rising last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon in vain, even though Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of Baruch College's first-year student
Almost two years after a student died in a fraternity chimp ceremony in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been brought against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College University in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership rites in September 2013, and then delayed his admission to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng’s eyes were tied and his back loaded with a bag of sand over 13 kg [13 kg] of sand, and he was repeatedly beaten to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field toward the goal.
Deng finally complained that his head was hurting, and then he passed out.
The members of the brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but the charges were that they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, look online for information about his symptoms, and contact the National Chair of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, asking him for advice, Commissioner Chris Wagner told at a press conference.
"This is where members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," Commissioner Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng sustained repeated blunt force traumas to the head, body and thigh.
"Too many families have suffered from fraternization when at least one student died each year as a result since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County grand jury argued that the first five members were charged with murder in third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent bullying and criminal intrigue.
"We do not want to be held accountable only to individuals; if there is an organisation that approved the situation either formally or informally, they must also be held responsible," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the National Brotherhood dismantled contact with the local department.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve increases interest rates
The interest rate increase will come, and the market for rising rates will collapse, bond yields will rise and the economy will be in recession.
This is what we know.
What we do not know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does little to help with timing, especially as regards the economy.
After the first withdrawal, the recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months, while sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates has often, although not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why officials of the Federal Reserve have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but rather on the development cycle of the time to normalise the situation.
Yes, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about raising interest has been excessive.
"The Central Bank's first post-global economic crisis increase will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the era of cheap money," said Capital Economics' chief financial expert Julian Jessop in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, albeit still low, to be a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react in the light of past developments:
As has been seen in the market in the past about a month, waiting for an increase in the interest rate can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It appears that the return on capital tends to stop 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Central Bank increase.
More specifically, in the last 35 years or so, the market is generally strong, rising by around 14% as a result of an increase, 250 days after which the situation is fairly steady (mean increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports a recent analysis of Nuveen Asset Management's leading capital strategy, Bob Doll, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is usually clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when profits begin to fall.
The recessions are part of the economy, but interest payments often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces a number of challenges which have not existed in the past and which can accelerate the recession.
This is in particular the gross domestic product, which will be the closest to its lowest ever level before the Central Bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, for the 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only been below 4.5% twice.
Although the figure in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will remain as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, reports the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The raising of interest in such a fragile economic setting may be risky and raises the question of whether "this time is different", Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been prepared for the Central Bank's increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept this increase at this meeting, futures trade only anticipates a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all cycles of increase have so far appeared in supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has passed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has begun," says the report.
On the other hand, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the period of observation.
In the current cycle, the Central Bank has been waiting by far the furthest from the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is already the 74th month.
The fixed return has also been unstable while the market is waiting to raise interest rates, and the model is somewhat similar to the capital findings.
The main difference is that when the Central Bank changes its policy, its effects are more visible in bonds than in shares.
The direction of the return on debt appears to change immediately for the first increase/cutting of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on bonds will decrease immediately," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will result in a convergence of longer-term and shorter-term bond yields, thereby smoothing the yield curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, even though "we are still careful about finding a return", Schwab's fixed return analyst Kathy Jones said in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to the outlook for a more rigorous monetary policy", he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, yield curves are more even, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policies.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are less able to do so when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have to finance.
"History shows that "high-quality" shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts stated in their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover exceeded the weak turnover by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares were better performing than lower-quality companies, with averages of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
It's gonna be a big problem.
Those companies with high floating interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers too have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Even savers can make a profit with higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly the impact is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM," says Congressman Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "citizenship"
He claims that it becomes increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were simply mimicking the Brit Awards
Mr Damien Collins criticised the Voice, saying that it was not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" into Classic FM, claims the leading congressman increasing the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "encourage" its content and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I would not like to use the term "people-conscious" - is becoming Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, only seem to be a Brit Awards gala under a different name.
So if you are trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly when you actually just copy something that is already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC President denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival as regards live music and the sharing of information to the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I cannot learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-class.
"In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's supply that was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, the music competition that the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not in any way original?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George are star judges, was produced "especially in the BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company to "find out the success inside his own house" the next time it started the show.
However, he refused to prevent future The Voice periods from being produced, or to order that the money of the permit-payers be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far rose least in August, Black Friday may be the cause
Online sales went up by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was the lowest rise since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that the November Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown soaring over a decade and has turned many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling down of online sales, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the beginning of statistics in 2000: only five per cent up from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a levelling down of online sales when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return to the year 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more reasonable over time," Andy Mulcahy, a supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales became stronger when buyers began using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online and that they could be done in different environments, such as the sofa.
But now it smooths out, and (growth) can fall.
Black Friday has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to their computers to pick up shops, knocking down the websites of many merchants.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue over discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead in Meka's crane accident, the consequences for Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the collapse of the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
Twenty-nine dead were carried in the air through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Most of the mourners dressed in white filled the path to honor the first of the dead who made their last journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed the sacred place, where just a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed that Bin Laden's family construction group was responsible for a disaster that also injured 394 people.
Of the worshipers killed by the cranes in the great mosque of Mecca, 29 were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the State-led Saudi Press Agency’s decision stated that the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s directors were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been caught for commenting.
The Royal Decision also accused the group of not using up - to - date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorologist authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the great mosque of Mecca, which are part of the huge building robbery run by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi dynasty for decades and is leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities report that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (GBP 174 000) to be paid to the deceased and to those permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says that East European low-cost workers are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, the trades for professionals will open 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are said to give up hammers and paint balconies and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home improvement work
Well, it looks like if you're smart with a hammer or you're good at painting walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British are hiring more and more assistants to do the do-it-yourself work in their homes," says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
The new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, Veronique Laury said that the popularity lies in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mockery price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new trades for employees and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wants more women to work in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions made in the store are made by the more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more one woman’s households where more home improvement work is done than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of purchases are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the most important companies in the UK FTSE100 index, who has rebuilt his management team so that it has the same number of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% of women in the group, including its Director-General and the Financial Director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board."
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both six months’ profits and sales after the group took over the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were thus obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employee centre organisations began to be forced right away and, as a result, the country stands on Friday because of a large number of workers' protests.
There's a lot of people who think there's reason there, too.
Let's see if it's a good idea to strike when things are bad anyway.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50 000 people have already gone online to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In the old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a criminal would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not give much thought to it, but it does give cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement. Values have changed.
From the point of view of the attractiveness of Ay movement’s operations, the Government’s drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years when things have seemed to be spinning in their own weight, the unions finally get to the point of defending, visibly and properly the employee’s rights.
In this way, the government may wish to detain the role of the Ay movement, as membership of the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary.
No matter what you think about the activities of the organizations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration will somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things should force everyone's head.
High saving for the University of Lappeenranta: To achieve savings of 8.5 million, 130 staff will be reduced
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a austerity course aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on staff as a whole, with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of some 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The Yt negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
In this financial year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant," says Rector Anneli Pauli in the university press release.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding is now reflected in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will start on Tuesday next week and will last for the six weeks prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain," Souter says.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
The first is local traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic will take place.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Of the other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in other parts of Europe.
The Federal Reserve of the United States must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is watching as the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters polled 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0,25 %.
This is an historic event, because it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero levels and start to normalise interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Senior Fellow of the Institute of Economics.
The US economy has worked relatively well and the recovery has brought billions of dollars into the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for a lift, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be made public on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning... before shooting her colleague later that day... Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "evil" about the first murder and hoped "you could call it off" told the authorities on Tuesday.
The Mississippi police officer at Gautier told us that the teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, Lamb, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he'd shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not bother anyone" but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give me an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note written by 45-year-old Lamb saying, "I'm so sorry I could undo it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed his history teacher Ethan Schmidt before finally killing himself late Monday when the police surrounded him.
William LaForge, president of the university, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind".
On Tuesday, the authorities said that, despite the allegations published on Monday that Mr Lamb believed Prentiss had had a relationship with Mr Schmidt, there was no "any knowledge or evidence" of any kind of "triangle drama".
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good man."
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "disturbed."
O'Steen told me Prentiss and his daughter were "one of the best friends ever."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from his home. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told them that Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car by the side of the road, left it there and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education in Delta State in spring 2015, says the CV found on the university's website.
The Stars That Lost Their Charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had a hard time in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered from leukemia and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really takes its toll.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United is out for months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double fracture of his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven at the Champions League.
Even though the defenseman remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle by 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into PSV territory.
She was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before taking her to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be moved tomorrow, or maybe a day after that, and then we'll have surgery in Manchester.
This is terrible, because a boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, he's going to be in trouble, and then he's going to play great, and this is what's going to happen.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing in the block phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official should be mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I'll come back stronger."

The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship next June in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, they're all very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for the Mexican team against the Van Gaal Dutch at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see him in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see Luke tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry."
The PSV’s Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling was challenged.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you almost memorize it.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday care service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’ book The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have not seen before."
All this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill out the fairly short original text.
"In the city of Need, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted hopes to win over the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's desire to see the right tree," the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, called Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds in some places like it was taken from the plot summary of the Lorax film found on the Internet Movie Database, which begins with the following: "In the city of Need, inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted hopes to win his dreams over the heart of Audrey girl."
In view of Cameron’s publicly active parenting, it seems unlikely that he would be so unacquainted with the plot of the book. In this young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by greedy, tree-cracking and need-weaving Kerskanen, ignoring the story of the short, moustache-like creature Lorax, who “speaks for the trees”.
Such a relatively invisible PR assignment is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesperson said the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being cut off from the English team, but it was still a tough one.
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I do not believe that the recent 3-0 series loss is likely to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out a foreign victory.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than a team from three years ago, but it includes good twisters and the team’s thinking is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positiveness.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral feeds, and Adil Rashid is an attacker, even though he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth fell from the English cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandablely difficult to analyse for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers under challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s selection before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and the Lythian season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
I hope if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, another chance will come up.
England’s head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected seven times on the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and at the guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean when Lyth was in excellent shape, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this obviously depends on the team’s composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in a punching opening at Cook's side has been thrown into the field with an extra pitcher, but we could keep four fast, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is three for them and there is little difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games on the first drop of the grid before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored 300 points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, as little as I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can watch his unscrupulous statistics hitting average 31 with a ball of 35 and think it's a gamble, but there's not too many pitchers on the table, and the voters chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions for the coach.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan batter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may prove to be a genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he brings with him a huge amount of experience because he's done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the white ball games, bringing both energy and a ruthless flash.
I've always thought he was born to be a part of the international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he's got the same mind as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the locker room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Even though not everyone agrees, coaches and choosing do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Those in favour of leaving the EU (Brex) can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic day by day, even if it does not take into account even the hearty Jeremy 'Is it a yes or no'? Corbyn's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the anger of the Confederation of Trade Unions in Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A fellow European diplomat recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain's self-centered agenda, which is full of concessions and disturbing treaty changes that these countries do not most want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it would not want them either if they were to undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without the local eye, and then come home and say they will win backers for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward look inside the British EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', says from Berlin - suggests that the shortest-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care if we leave.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her business before it gets ruined in the same way as it happened to the late Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a losing power, too.
Poland could soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain could have a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the selfiebrides, when their energy would rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even deliberately plan to make useless remarks like the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign in order to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiations had been arranged and the renegotiations had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptic the press sovereigns are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed in the 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing about 'EU direct bananas' when he was a correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse number of tax-exempters, foreigners hacking phones, and people who have their nominal place of residence elsewhere and own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought exactly the same thing about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a horny gorilla, bananas have to be abandoned for a distraction if you don't want to be on that gorilla's lunch menu and later on dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair-like than Blair himself when it came to opposing Cameron's renegotiation trick, because he had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which the French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thereby giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back of the Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him that he no longer has time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of reintroducing Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is still forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, whom the BBC sofa Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it beautifully, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in a reformed Europe.
Well, the majority of people outside the UK Independence Party Ukip's war paint and the conservative party's fiercest nationalists can certainly support this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said this both on the radio and on TV this week when her inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint rough John McDonnell as shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law stuck on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's straining was more attractive.
But the fight to keep up with 'any situation' - Mr Benn's statement - was not what Mr McDonnell said, nor, by all accounts, what Mr Corbyn told the princes and parliamentarians at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24-hour television, and especially in social media vortexes, which is a suitable breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support for the referendum campaign for granted.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But the fundamental spiral between McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-mindedly regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate among left-wing thinkers for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal struggles.
With regard to his duality with regard to NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it may be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed at the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the cost-cutting conservative government is in power, as I was reminded of at the start of Monday's British Influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticized Public Health England’s assessment of electric tobacco
Scientists have said that the government-funded agency’s claim that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing at the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric tobacco.
The PHE published its report last month describing it as "a comprehensive overview of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month's medical journal Lancet published an editorial that attacked the "exceptional" bottom of the PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the claim made by the PHE "at present, according to the best estimate, electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" is based on detailed evaluation and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people who developed a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose president was reported to have previously received funding from Bristol American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported having received funding from the manufacturer of electric tobacco, but not from the funding he was reported to have previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they increase.
The selection criteria for panel members are not stated, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of electric tobacco, some of whom also say in the study that they have received funding from the sector.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco director of the PHE.
The study produced by the group "speakfully admits" that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence concerning the disadvantages of most products and most of the criteria", writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that the claims made by the PHE that "there is no evidence that electric tobacco acts as a route for smoking children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at the PHE, says that the claims made in the BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, "Electric cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Half the people who burn their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electric tobacco are relatively low, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even if electronic cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the harmful effects of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 leader
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" for such hits as this soap series on Albert Square.
Mr Johnson said that licence fees should only be used for programmes that are not carried out by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, into difficult transmission times against the most watched programmes of competitors and on channels such as the BBC4.
After Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC, said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried Channel 4 for six years to build a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea of the BBC producing and transmitting programmes that are clearly suitable for non-subventive competitors," Johnson said to the upper room communication committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this media or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice is being sent to the most important broadcasting time because of the desire to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Mr Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, admittedly within the house executed.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all."
The series entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 in 2004-2010, said that the BBC is involved in the hunt for the number of viewers "because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the most popular series in the BBC, similar to the comments of former Sky Director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC’s smaller public public service programmes “go to BBC 4 where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then hypocritically state, in defence of the permission fee of GBP 4 billion, that ‘well, I guess we do all these unknown programs that no one looks at’.
They put them on a mission site where no one will ever come to see them.
Regarding the fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system of who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that for £150 a year you get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for people who have £150 for a lot of money because they don't use the BBC much.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also testified to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its role of "information, training and entertainment" during Reith.
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as training - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should follow the example of Australian and Canadian broadcasters and turn the task into "information, education and entertainment".
With regard to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he says are only shown on television, and to join commercial companies in such a way that all of these can be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" enables brain cell control through sound waves
The video shows how the shuttle worms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically engineered nerve systems to control them with sound waves.
The tiny shuttle worms change direction as soon as they are hit by an audio impulse too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion neurons with ultrasonic channels.
Related: Researchers read and write about brain activity with light
Scientists said that worms show the functionality of a new method known as sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that this method may one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure that leads electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Shuttle depressions do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, the structures found in the membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonic shuttleworms, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified carpets, microbubbles reinforced sound waves and transmitted them to carpets where they turned on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetic, groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along the optical fiber to the desired location within the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue without barrier, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and the therapeutic virus, it may be possible to cause the target human neurons to react momentarily to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Adverts Embarrass Britain’s Armoured Trade
Watch the video against Amnesty International.
Horrible killer machines!
Ankle-crushing leghold traps!
Grape bombs!
And electrical stun batons that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
A joyful voice and comic book imagery leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British Government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive governments at the Defence and Security Equipment International ExCeL Centre in London docks.

With the separate campaign, there were also many posters for bus stops and subway trains that require a closer look.
"Intelligent information, will you travel on the DLR route on September 15-18?" is asked together using London's underground font and brand, as DLR's track turns into a tank image.
In this September, a group of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... clients are asked to help stop the gun show.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were displayed at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Public Plans).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters all over London using Ad Space Hack Packs. This is a six-pound package of six-pound hexagon keys that, according to the collective, "get access to one third of the entire bus stop advertising space on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "Declaration vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in resistance breasts when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100,000 times over the last 24 hours through Facebook. It was created free of charge by the advertising agency VCCP, and also the graphic designer and background reviewer worked for free.
The creative director of the VCCP, Matt Leverin, discovered that the gun fair was not advertised at all, and there was an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar at the time, and he thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were toying with the idea of a more realistic advert of shady corporation, but "it was more stopping to emphasize it with bright colors and animation".
"They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the gun fair comes from inside ExCeL, when exhibitors shop for fantasticly embellished products.
Saab announced in his press release that he received an order from the U.S. Army for the "at4CS RS from the shoulder".
This includes a "unique tube-fired tip that puts excellent effects on the rear of the armor inside the object".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a dormitory
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm when I wasn't aware of it when I was 19, and I still believed in beretts and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I annoyed... and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything that gets on your nerves to be totally scary.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, tell me if you took a year off and what you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just yeast extract HAHAHA to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to take a breath... ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like and not those you would not want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they share the extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie parties and high entertainment places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Do not even think about starting a university when you are in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a room-to-house culture that is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so that I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you".
Try to sense when a college friend is tired of socializing, and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
Knocking when the speech came: knock.
A guy in my dorm thought if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting a university at the top of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cake plate and introducing yourself seems somewhat less strange, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from the '50s.
Offering self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake or not.
Badly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep while you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in dorms.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask the owner of the milk and check it out.
It's possible they'll give you permission even if they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to deal with it more adultly than my dormmate who mixed in his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You should not make noise so that people cannot sleep or learn.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot beating on a pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music lower because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making her own music roar, locked her doors and took a three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband moved into the same dorm with you?
Or in reverse, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you thought of your roommate as your future mate, joined up, divorced, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot roommate isn't really your future mate, you could at least try to reason with your bottom.
In that exhilarating moment when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between trickery and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but you can be canceled in no time.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys into a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer, but don't put their property on the ceiling with a blue sticker like twice at the most.
Racist attack on the residence of foreign students in Kitee - The house planned as a reception centre was mauled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made on the residence of foreign students in Kitele, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations of underage asylum seekers but the sleeping rooms of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher of the Evangelical Folk High School in Kite.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodations were smeared with racist signs such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through one of the windows of the accommodation room," says the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luke, responsible teacher for youth social guarantee training at the Folk high school, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalised building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend, and adult people are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere," says Luke.
People from 12 different nationalities are accommodated at the Folk High School.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in the mucked-up building have a status.
Some of them study in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukainen says.
The A status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of injury and violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, an information conference was held for students on Monday, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time that something like this has happened," says Lukeinen.
According to the reading, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The perpetrators were suspected of being at least three men and had been on the move by a light passenger car.
I think this is a young people's weekend whim, since this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," says Luke.
There is also a hospital in Salo that has been maimed with a reception center.
The case happened last week.
This was told by MTV on its website on Tuesday night.
There was a swastika drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a report from the police.
Ambition 15.9. 16:02 Corrected for incorrect police data on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government's going to shut down the Y train to Karjaa with all the passengers in their hands, "just idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja stops running in March.
The news upset passengers arriving at the main railway station in Helsinki at the beginning of the evening shift.
In particular, the descent strikes the people of the Siuntites," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic because the population is constantly increasing and people in work need a fast and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This can't be about anything but political will or lack of political will.
Bengtström says with HSTV's interview video he'll be taking a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track will be combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train traffic in the next contractual period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in autumn will be adopted later by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a citizen of Siuntio, considers that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
And then there's regret.
The Y-train is also used by others other than the Raseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyryä from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further from the city area by train.
"It is particularly bad for those who have to redesign their journey," he said in pain on the Y train.
There's gonna be a little relief.
There is probably a new train connection to the beach track that will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, i.e. it will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will entail increased costs for HSL, in practice for the municipalities and their taxpayers in the region.
"We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid around one million dollars per year for the Y train, the Ministry of Transport is much more than this.
The R line on the main track skips two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, on the other hand, the number of trains will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train shifts will decrease on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips a year are made on end-of-life shifts, while the total number of trips in traffic purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to provide the State with annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter on the topicality of Capital: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises in the world economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, to the top, writes Yrjö Hakanen, a former Chairman of the SKP, in his book Marx's Capital Time Today.
"He is now being taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy in all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of financial and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University's professor, a respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever".
But the former Managing Director of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation is not a Marxist, is it?
No, no, no, no.
On the phone Korkman says that he does not view Marx as a timely economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary scholar.
"The usual view is that the history of ideas tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
True, Marx's predictions went a long way wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the early stages of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Again, we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that is changing as a result of a technological revolution," Korkman says.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx won't help.
After all, he felt that capitalism was a hopeless case and should only be stopped.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to get to know Marx.
"In the '70s Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskists and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burdens of the past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mind as well as other classics," says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to be set up to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka’s civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100 000 people have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
There's no record of the number of victims.
In particular, the military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as the UN report calls for.
The report blames the Sri Lankan Armed Forces for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence as likely as men and women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combat.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it was going to organise the investigation itself, but was not going to allow the UN Court to be set up because of the foreign judges.
In the English yo experiment, you got to weigh social media.
On Wednesday, the autumn matriculation examination had a long foreign language, most of which was English.
Over 16,000 new recruits tested their English skills.
You could write a paper on social media or something.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the 150-250 - word writing in English could address the online magazine’s advice column to the administrator.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelian reclining chair.
He was to be consulted on how to get parents to look at things also for young people.
In total, there were four subjects, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," said English lecturer Mia Lybeck of Porvoo Swedish-speaking high school.
The third subject was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, Lybeck said, was all right.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing to write speeches," Lybeck says, and evaluates the whole experiment as "pretty normal".
In English - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts that addressed, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when the second Finnish or Swedish test will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is arranged normally, so it is not influenced by the employee's demonstration.
The matriculation examination board invites the trainees to find suitable transport connections in time for the trial.
You can also get more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a store was robbed at gunpoint
A shop was robbed in the Kello district on Wednesday morning in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering Komandopy.
He's normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and got a small amount of money.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
The protest against the Government's decision to cut will block the city center on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary reports, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
On the other hand, it is not only the task of the police at work to carry out the alarm missions and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant demonstration goes smoothly.
Roads to the railway market are closed to motor vehicles between 9.30 and 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the western direction from Mannerheiminti.
Do you have enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on a cop's industrial battles.
According to Kujala, there are support patrols coming to Helsinki from other parts of Finland due to the demonstration.
The police won't tell us exactly how many patrols they've got.
"Something's coming, but we'll be fine on our own as a rule," Kujala says.
The police urge you to avoid private cars in the city center of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic can be expected from the morning to the beginning of the evening.
With protestors from other parts of Finland there are also a lot of ordering buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to the Railway Market.
As a rule, the buses are quite distant.
The rest of the trip will then have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, is now dealt with partly by itself.
The organisers have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary people who work or are unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finns are reasonable and peaceful people," says Kujala.
Local demonstrations are also held on Friday in different parts of Finland.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, it does not have a very good benchmark in Finnish political history," says Emeritus Martti Siiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Eliotäinen.
A very right-wing government has hit at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grips are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that we are actually trying to bring the Ay movement to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
Mirrors are needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about among those whom the Ay movement would like to see involved in the demonstration.
In November 1993, unemployed persons from all over Finland showed their minds at the Parliament House.
If you look for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant protest of the unemployed, Murrostortstai, held in 1993, says Siiäinen.
In the midst of the deepest recession, the Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (central government) stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as it was during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement is perhaps even worse than it was in the days of Murrostorstai.
Besides, Finland's most powerful bourgeois government is now in power," says Siiäinen.
The present coalition of governments is still interesting in that it is so strict in the right despite what the Finns have said.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time.
Several thousand protestors are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly shuts down day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it can become the biggest in years.
In recent years, some 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations in the Ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict, are law-abiding.
The protestors are trying to avoid damage to or destruction of property," says Siiäinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The strike of firefighters lasted three months in 1998.
The pilots and air traffic controllers also had spectacular strikes.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electrical strike in 1977.
Seventy thousand metal men took part in the strike of the metal men.
The strike was suspended by a settlement commission motion after seven weeks of strike.
The metal guys got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power cuts across the country.
Murrostorstai 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20 000 people, many of them unemployed by the recession, met in front of the Parliament House to express their views on work.
Firefighters struck for three months in 1998
Firefighters strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in the fall of eggs when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
To Espa, the farmers fell a ton of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses struck for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The strike in 1995 was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and carers' mass redundancies in 2007.
The threat of mass disbandment was finally a catalyst for the outcome of the negotiations.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike... under duress," was the slogan of strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and gave rise to a lively discussion on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched in favour of student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliament House in 2013.
C.I.P.D. is looking into the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help with the investigation of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, in Aisterheim, near the German border, the Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
All the people in the truck were in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by lorry in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by asphyxiation.
According to the first Finnish Broadcasting Company, which reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, among other things, and its CEO is a man with a foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A captain who beats refugees, a former drug courier and a rich businessman... the story of five smugglers.
He's a loaded king of smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylistic missionary, and a cab driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people are smuggling human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola of the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers" and their book Death Travel Agency is published in Finnish this week.
In the book they present human smuggling tentacles, suggest solutions, and present smugglers on different steps of the business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I'll kick their ass right now.
The Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia are not attractive to foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for the summer.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling, since the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres away.
By comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more productive for a fisherman to transport people.
Emir has already done so hundreds of times with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If you fill a boat, you can fit 40 people.
Emir makes about 8,000 euros for one trip.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis struck again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that customers can barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that is their problem.
We're going to the water at midnight with a switched off lantern.
On the first night we drive off the islands, then we stop, wait for the day, and the next night we drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves of 20 meters, passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the day, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour, and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants people to be afraid of him.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's gonna beat the hangers to death.
He says in the book that when the police caught sight of him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he's gonna have to beat his countrymen up for this.
I'll beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good... the starter engine is pulling its last, and he's seen the best of his days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
Men who travel without their family in the woods around the city centre are staying in tents, lava and abandoned cars, which is what everyone has been able to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When finally arriving in the territory of Bogovaða, the great node of human smuggling, people are dead tired.
Goran’s drivers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say it once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
You're a silly, silly, silly, silly little thing all the way over here.
First the price is set at 300 euros, then they count it to 200, and finally they offer 150.
Goran insists on being a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and only charges EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about a hundred miles, most of it comfortable on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but it is a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and shakes away.
The Work of Loneliness
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary, and that is not just a nickname.
He really does have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where many religious refugees from the Congo are visited, as well as a small center to help Congolese children’s refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of loving - kindness.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer starts by calling one of the Missionary’s five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money neatly and slouch among the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee to the Ugandan authorities, we must tell them that we come, for example, from war zones in North Kivu and that we have had to flee our homes from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old I.D. will be destroyed and another will be replaced.
That's where the Missionary contacts with the Ugandan police help.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to the NGOs, eventually to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: it costs about EUR 100 to submit an application to the Ugandan police; it costs approximately EUR 150 to process documents to the humanitarian organisation; and it costs EUR 4 500 to 7 000 to move to a European country, for example.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom's a rookie smuggler, an ex-drug courier.
A 40 - year - old from Ireland is on call on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks headed to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan driver in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
In the night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near Calais city center.
They're driving the A26. They're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been on drugs for seven years.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck, and we have to make sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example, and cut the safety wire on the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, a similar one wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should stop the police thermal scanner from picking up the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver won't catch any stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Mummer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Upporka the Turk has been called the champion of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, which dominates maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only needs the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is the luxury boat scheme: Turkish ports rent yachts to take American or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are being loaded into a crowded area of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000, first from Istanbul to a port and then from there to Europe by sea.
Customers are kept in human stores, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuck in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, for there are no other signs of the crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury ferry journey after costs.
He does not do practical things on his own, but hires the captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other smaller workers to do the work for him.
In the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought land through undercover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Mummer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, apparently, he's gone missing.

An American Olympic runner tells of his book About His Sickness and Become a Prostitute
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in excellent shape and ran in the competitions for the second best time.
In the finals, however, he panicked.
From the outset, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership position in a manic race.
However, 150 meters before the paint, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and other rivals passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I pushed myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself was under tremendous pressure of success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money for having sex with strange men.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
Another explanation of Favor Hamilton’s becoming a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline spikes he had when he competed in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The dual life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world’s number one in statistics at 3.57.40, but was the last in Sydney’s Olympic final.
The world champion rejoiced when the union disciplined Norway’s ski rooster: “Direct-backed”
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been wringing an athlete's agreement for the whole summer and autumn, just like last year.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the world champion and the Olympic champion.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision was commended by two world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski rooster in check.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug obviously wants to be part of the national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Mr Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that will also take care of future generations and will not allow one athlete to go solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that Northug had been granted financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release in which he assured us that he would like to play in Norwegian colours next season at the World Cup as well as then at the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, two of them gold.
He was in Falun last winter on a team that won the message gold.
The plate day of the roast translators is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D., 25.9., there will be stunts in various restaurants and shops, which have been granted the roast translator's shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but that the top restaurants that have been inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
An Old Town restaurant is taking part in the plate day in Kokkola.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most important international events in the organisation, which will take place in the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland continues to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre at the premises of Kauhava’s former garrison currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Separate Networks Oy, is still in permanent location.
Kauhajoki magazine says that, according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air Force School, the impact of which has also not been explained when preparing the reception centre, says the newspaper.
The case states that for the last two years negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and on the arrival of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with the Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
A private person informs the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of fundamental opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
Kauhava City Board dealt with the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions," Niinistö says to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern about managing the refugee situation brought all the participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the underlying issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the Russian and US activities in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also overlooked in the discussions.
The President did not comment on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Starts closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia is told that the operations of airports will be managed by the supervisory forces during the work stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of the city centre
A demonstration on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
Police report that the streets leading to the Railway Market will be closed off from the cars around 9.30-14.
From the direction of the Mannerheimintie, no cars are allowed in the direction of Kaivokatu, Postikatu and Töölönlahdenkatu railway station.
From Unioninkatu Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Railroad and Metro Staff informed the STT this evening.
Most of the Starts close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's demonstration will also cause disruptions to Posti's services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, in the delivery of day mail.
Most of the post office service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Finnish Red Cross is carried out despite the strike.
There is also an attempt to manage food transport, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
Information on situational services is available on the Posti website.
Most of Finland’s Alkoi will close their doors on Friday for two hours.
The service trade union Pam has instructed her employees to stop work between 11 and 13.
Pam has also called on employees in the grocery trade to take part in the demonstration of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that they are trying to keep the stores open by supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, no information is yet available on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki Day Care Centres partially closed
The Helsinki day care centres do not function to their full extent on Friday, reports the Helsinki Office for Early Childhood Education.
Due to the demonstration by the trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds will not be organised.
Day care centres and groups of children with mental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The ECEC promises to report further changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Cowfish takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication needs diverse channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio talks are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä said to journalists in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s TV and radio talks become a recurring practice.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be passed on to Yle in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, we'll see.
We're going to use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio to be given to citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is rather complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up on this channel. Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent from 9:05 to 21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the Yle Arena.
I'm afraid the cipher is taking a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television talk will not tell about a more general government’s introvert.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse a public debate on questions? Anu Koivunen, professor at Stockholm University, is thinking.
It reminds me of the recent comment by the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not linked.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant at Sipilä's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media field didn't react.
The media styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
It is the responsibility of the representatives of the media, by definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians as given.
Koivuse says TV talk is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, the pig should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more of what we have heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it extraordinary time.
Even the commoner will take the risk in that sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be labeled as a media of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or the general line.
A Shrewd Bet
What the Prime Minister does not say is also important in future speech by the media researcher.
In the evening we should look closely where Sipilä is missing and not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutti, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, as this allows him to bring out his own vision without gravel sounds.
This will bring the message to the general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The cipher passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because no specific questions can be asked.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV... whether the sweat is leaking, the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to put things right, it can work.
The situation is different from that of a government telling something because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners regularly engage in.
That's very unusual.
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional for the citizens.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means," says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants the Finns to be sympathetic to the blackmail that lies ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow discussion of the speech.
Antti Rinne (sd.), Chairman of the SDP, again announces that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy has been found and the son's father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inland Finland also confirms the matter to the Evening Journal.
The boy went out to play around 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent fad of young people: You create hatred
A Kurdish-backed free fighter, Makwan Amirkhani, released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with immigrant background.
Mr Amirkhani made a strong speech against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me that he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos loaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed with the young people's fad.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking down on the ground, sitting on the other one and hitting him blindly without thinking about any of these consequences, what will happen when you do this kind of videos, Amirkhani updates.
♪ Hard to defend anymore ♪
Some of the young people on video are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Inspector of the Helsinki Police Department, fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
The very fact that you're fighting all over the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants harder here in Finland," Amirkhani from Turku reminds me.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have come to a very high degree.
A little hard, boys, to defend you no more.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be quite a long time strangers here.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here," says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to some kind of racism, you'll have to blame yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a source of money for racism.
You make me hate something I don't like.
You're in pretty bad shape anyway, and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
GERMANY pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK on Twitter, says that on Monday the employees' association will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK announced that it would submit its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest association of employees (SAK) soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, made a brief comment on the matter on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Mr Lyly points out that Mr Sipilä's government's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä closed negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit itself to a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: "It feels a little funny to shake a fist"
It's kind of funny to shake a fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospheres vary in wage and salary camp from side to side.
Is the government going to scream down or even settle with it?
On Monday, the federal leaders of the SAK expressed holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with catching up.
The threat spread to the Akavals.
The Teachers' Trade Union (OAJ) threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or day care centre is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd) was amicable.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hastened immediately to announce that his settlement papers are ready.
At first there was no sound from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lyly (sd) finds it difficult to agree when the federal leaders just Monday told the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for wage and salary earners, SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as an objective.
No wonder Palola STTK has relations with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Idealus, Director of Social Impact at STTK, used to be a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
As Palola described, the government's ay-skills have been improving all along.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a little bit off the Finnish seismics, whose figurehead is the ACP Marko Pierainen (sd).
It's kind of funny, if you already have a make-up paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, at which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Festival in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced into the European Union to come to the meeting - a matter of which the President reminded journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again. Naryshkin stressed according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also against the United States, where his access had been blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was able to make it easy, so Naryshkin continued Finland's stinging with praise and praise for Mongolia's 'excellent organisation'.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there are no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who, according to the Russian media, has already spoken to the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "The paints are tight"
Astara and the Clave will continue the bull's day in Haka Forest today when both of them are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no actual paint party in Haka Forest today.
Last night, Samara visited Kuopio for a 3-2-continuation victory over Kalpa.
The rise was manly, for last season’s silver group was at its worst from the defeat position of two goals.
The Tuesday of the Clave was more minor.
There were round zero points for the Rauman prey, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Lock Attacker Janne Lahti anticipates arrangements on the club's website.
The Sanomara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumars.
In fact, in the last two seasons, the Tapara has just dropped in the semifinals of the Clave.
Both times a decisive seventh game has been called for.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tatara rose to the next three arms and past.
There are no major changes in the formations of the groups except for the goalies.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday are getting a flute shift today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Clave poles.
Viewpoint: A bad play going on in Aces
Sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone screened Rocky, where he himself played the lead.
In a sensational way, the underdog struggled with the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola scripted Pori's restless Cinderella story.
Unnamed and wood-handed pottery progressed to everyone’s surprise at the SM finals 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Pori's Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the irokes.
The Toivola became a blonde.
A great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter Toivola believes that this season's renewal will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of Ässi has built a pottack on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been hitting guys in the trough like Rocky's pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen have the merit of playing something other than the reel.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crucified Iron Rock as Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy in Rocky as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's no Rocky in the Iron Rock but a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Rock does not include rushing and little pigging.
He appreciates the hard play, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, the Garret Stafford of Äss took a hit on the head of Tatara Jere Karelian.
He got 2 to 10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't approve of that kind of game, and it's not part of the ace puck, and the hot Iron Rock snapped after the game to the people of Satakunta.
This season's team is strangely built.
There are kids, veterans, policemen and promotions.
In practice, there are no key men of the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events affect procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smokin' under the surface.
In 1953, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
Ace balance in the three league games of the season has as many losses as the goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan shouldn't have written a sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of a friend of my husband's.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked hard together before, but for the first time Olga is acting under Tuukka's guidance.
Olga's role in Apulanna's early years film Made Us Beautiful is the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Cricket tsmaps and supports his son, even though his father Ricky (proposed by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my real role model, Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two of them have come much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
Cricket's been really helpful.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna was going to be the biggest band in Finland.
There was a depression in the '90s, and it was really lame.
There was a pretty low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuukka about his youth even before the movie plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been somewhat different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola’s notorious skateboard story of known Tuukka.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At the most, he could have been secretly attracted.
Olga says he's been working with Tuukka so much over the last ten years that a big project together is not scary.
Everything's always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot at Heinola for a month.
True, the couple in Lithuania often plan to drive home for their young children because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over Heinola for a month.
They have received us so warmly, asking only which streets and when will be cleared out.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
The budget for Timo Vuorensola's film Iron Sky: The Coming Race is EUR 17 million.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifi movie Iron Sky's sequel, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive drama film with a budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been at the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation, which is being done, will also rise past Iron Sky 2, because the budget for the film is over EUR 100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of the giant budget.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what it's supposed to be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something we've never seen before.
I love going to Belgium.
Just because time's tight doesn't mean there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she'll tell the Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film was set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million would be added to the film, because every angle and effects are so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's not one loose one.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final interest rate will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
What do you mean, hillbilly or cool?
Big logos go back to shirts
Lately, big logos have adorned the fronts of trend setters.
Not long ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or a T-shirt brand was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sport has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sport fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so often before, the line between the funny and the trendy: if something's right, it's starting to turn ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, where trend setters surprised by preferring as dull basic clothes as possible as a way of separating themselves from the mass.
Instead of putting on a grey basic college, we are putting on the sweatpants that are already buried at the bottom of the cabinet with the manufacturer’s logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas’ recognisable track sweatpants, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have made a return to street fashion.
Calvin Klein logos on the bottom of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sport to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace’s fall sweaters makes clear the mark of the garment.
Would you be prepared to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released the evidence: I didn’t get stuck in the tank for hours!
It was claimed that a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency was forced to remove Zotov from the large tank door for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook site where he seems to be peeking through the hatch of a armored vehicle in a very good mood and, at least, based on the pictures, it is not a matter of being stuck or angry.
That's nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in the armored car. It was the assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served on Ural.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army TV channel that he was admiring Russian new technology at the exhibition because he was himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage. I was admiring our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even at the next show, I'm definitely going to visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and crooked, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen," he said to the Russkaya Sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of alleged stuck persons have been published, even though 50 000 people visited the gun show in a few days.
The argument about Zotov being stuck started in the first place on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told that he struggled out of the tank door when he tried and threatened to finally shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot site published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers gave their views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilä mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water from the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called richshika basin to the ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool is filled with enriched and purified process water that is neutralised by the foaming process.
In general, the water is either pumped to be reused as process water or passed into the environment through a surface casting field as permitted.
The leak was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material leaked into the environment.
The bleeding was detected during the inspection tour on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the dam structure of the basin has been observed.
The company says that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation was struggling with structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and for unemployment benefit.
According to Chief Economist Pasi Kuoppamäki of Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
There is a lot of sympathy in the IMF's assessment for the government's actions, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments," says Kuoppamäki to Economics.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4% economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske today, in his new forecast for the economic cycle, expects growth to fall to zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had some of the latest sightings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported a slight increase in GDP in the summer," says Kuoppamäki.
Again, less attention has been paid to the weakened trust in industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few per cent of decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is no big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, assessed by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is to take Nintendo strongly into the mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear each year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants are lost every year on their website, including SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Juha Kannelma, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there a similar situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear in a "under country" year?- In 2013, a total of 156 applications for asylum were made in Finland for unaccompanied minors.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelma says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear in the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and is potentially of an adult age.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were subject to a lapse decision because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so that 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year," he says.
Is there an increase in the number?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for unaccompanied minors.
Overall statistics on minors who have disappeared this year are not yet available, but the number of applicants for minors is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of persons who have disappeared, he stresses.
What will happen to those who have taken the decision to convert?
Do they also disappear into the "black labour market", for example?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of conversion decisions, Kannelma emphasises.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action.
On Monday, the Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU Home Ministers meeting, announced practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen for TV and radio productions by a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to sickness attacks is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professionals in the field.
The first one to tell about the online announcement was the online magazine Evening Makasin.
Today, much of the equipment has been left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested parties will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of his current home in Stormylä.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've slowly begun to inventory and see what things are being abandoned.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV and radio devices anymore.
It is clear from recent strokes that the man who made a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Stormylä.
Traffic is threatening to go to worse ground than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the metro and trams decide today whether they will expand their efforts in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief confidence man Pekka Hirvonen says he's a big player in the field.
The cuts in nighttime and shift supplements are a serious pain for drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the allowances are a source of opposition.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is virtually completely stagnant.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains leaving before 6 a.m. will be driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the pit.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Most likely a small number of buses can be driven, driven by superiors, says the HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which bus runs on Friday.
Employees’ organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Market on Friday between 11 and 13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the Associated Press.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas. The teacher thought it was a bomb.
In the United States, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher considered the homemade watch he brought to school a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that all he wanted to do was show off the proceeds of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
At no time has Mohammed been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, there's still a chance the boy could be accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police found that the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The watch is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedia was punished for three days' forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council is wondering if the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's roaring - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticisms of the right-wing press have also been shared by the members of the Corbyn Labour Party.
This has offended the people, suspected Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
At yesterday’s memorial service, the British Air Force pilots ’ battle against the German Luftwaffe was respected in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown his respect to the pilots by taking part in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
The election of Corbyn as party leader has divided the ranks of the Labour Party.
Especially among the MPs are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is due to appear as party leader in Parliament during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the turn of the week, Cameron was on Twitter about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
The reason for the Minnesota family murder is still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit.
South Lake Mintonka police have been investigating the family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five was found dead in her home on September 10th and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family’s father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the children’s absence.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection and found the Short family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million House and a Successful Company
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitari, police chief of South Lake Mintonka, is still ongoing.
The motive for the acts of blood is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his property on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors on the site each week.
I've had 50 buy-outs made over the last ten years for the company.
I've abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected, among other things, in the fact that the Short family bought a large house in Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
In Zillow, the house is advertised as a car collector’s dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no defamatory comments had been removed from Short’s website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the proceedings would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me a cup of coffee.
In addition, the three owners were awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great. Loiri commented with a good spirit on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the big race.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, a successful horse’s coach, Raven, will have full peace of work while working with the horse.
Pekka decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri.
An amazing gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens’ superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital report, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising activities for the next seven years.
Subban made an eight-year and $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
So Subban's donation is significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby that bears his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have previously contributed significantly to local hospitals.
One year ago, long-time captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another city’s large hospital to provide the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife at a Japanese cafe for the evening - serve the food just in bikinis and an apron.
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe on the market, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a hug shop, and now a wife's coffee shop.
It strikes the lonely, the courtship, and the hungry.
There's a news report from Metro.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening from Ore no Yome (My wife) in Tokyo.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "half" is selected from the list before entering the café and he prepares and serves the food.
She's just up against an apron and a bikini on, and her husband's in tight bike shorts.
The website provides all information on the length of the wife candidates and always puts pressure on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: attacks against car security began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector," says Intel's press release.
The Board consists of top security experts from around the world.
AsRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report in the future on the basis of the research results of the ASRB.
The international ICT research and consultancy company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve car safety," says Chris Young, director of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been waiting years for the moon to rise.
Finally, the car is also beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford released R.S. data now that the car world's eyes are on the Frankfurt Car Show.
Ford’s new four-wheel drive RS speeds up in 4.7 seconds, thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350 horsepower engine, from zero to 100, with a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, but it is estimated to be EUR 52 000.
The car can already be ordered, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not state in his press release.
The favorite brand Kia introduced two new features in Frankfurt's car show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia plans to catch a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market, is certainly more important than the two new developments in Finland.
Sportage, created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more circular than before.
The axle spacing and the external dimensions have come in an inch here and the car is more efficient than before.
The overall range of engines is unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are told closer to coming to sale.
We will have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage will arrive for us in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimats will reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand-new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Optimums with 1.7-litre turbo diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines are at the start.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as Optima GT comes alongside them with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu's back on the stage. He's in a brave jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's an impressive open neckline in an electric blue pantsuit.
It's a beautiful costume that presents the delicate waist of a singer's star.
The whole is crowned with a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, the mother - made singer has lost the weight of pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on the stage and getting up in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related activities, the singer tells me.
Chisu will release his new and fourth album in a few weeks' time called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astounding again - now you see the breast
Real TV beauty Kim Kardashian talks one after the other.
She's showing off her baby belly and breast equipment in sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in America, when she left her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, for her husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
As the flashes flash, it reveals the skin - colored bra under the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity costume, he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when there was a pregnancy stomach on the tour.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to take a shortcut to the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary about Talking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths out of model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine put together six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you were in the last season posing in top designer costumes, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the business, competing for a job with cons.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and it can take a year to accommodate a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearablely difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop a few pounds, but then in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk all the time.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are always together and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference will be sad.
Models want to be in this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a show of clothes.
Even models want to be their own people.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models last night at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their next year’s collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the founder of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet a real Antti before, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Clearly, Antti is the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's all right that I'm just learning his style of playback from the video.
I don't want to make an impression on a person.
The man who pilots the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs band is not going to be in the role.
Punk-managers come with a man by nature.
I'm sure a lot of people in the punk episode of "Stars, Stars" saw a preview, too, if you've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been small-minded, it always goes to the fullest.
The leading actors in the film "You Made Us Beautiful" by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in 1993-2004, were released today.
The core group, known to the audience of the band, is presented to the general public by young actors who are still quite unknown.
Drumper Sipe Santapukki plays Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen tipped off his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already published on Instagram yesterday a picture of his new look, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, seen earlier in the mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents in recent days have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to force this issue, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting smaller children, not allowing them to watch the news alone, for example.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and be distressed," he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about them elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child in vain, even if you're being distressed and scared.
A smaller child closely monitors the behavior of his or her parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to run into discussions about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to bring it up with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with the children, parents can consider how our family views this.
But, in the end, do we think that the world is a safe place or an unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational viewpoints - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if you also talk about difficult things in your family, your child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come into life.
This could be useful for him in the future.

You're out of your powers?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the ball salami that hits the Vermo.
Perttu Pohjola was able to grind the Clover Ball Salam into a blow in the middle of the summer.
It was only racing profits and second positions until the collapse of the Tampere raves at the end of July.
Since the stallion was completely frozen, the coach suspected that something was wrong and ordered a period of protégé from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the blackout was found in the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not of the mildest mind, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Clover’s ball flash had to be on light exercise, the Nordic Region says that it is positively surprised at the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE in Turku in its record time after the Taruntuuli.
The clover’s ball flash was under great pressure from the break when it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, it was understandable to bend at the end," says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that the stallions got a kick out of a good race.
The horse must have moved on from there, and hopefully it would have settled.
Clover’s Balllight has been called humorous horses.
When you don't feel like it, it could have thrown you fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallions have lost such a throttle that their opponents have been amazed.
At a short speed, fellow competitors can't compete with Balllights, which even sheds warm - blooded rides.
There's a race in Vermo.
However, the difference is how the Clover Ball Flash agrees to it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it's like, you know, you know, you know, you could go under the boom and stuff like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than when Turku left.
The clover’s ball flash can also come out of the bow when it’s in order, and we’ll take it for a win, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple is possibly going to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future," says Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed, the company’s CEO.
Apple’s iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively few to use: FaceTime calls, Journal kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips, for example.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it, because the company does not want to waste memory space on the iPhone phones of users.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, according to Eurostat today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower prices of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% estimate a little downwards from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for underlying inflation was 1.0 %.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU 28 was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most in the euro area, or by 1.4 per cent.
Cyprus had the lowest inflation rate when prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a price increase close to 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
US Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin in less than a year’s time, but it will be more likely within three years after the country’s central bank, Fed, resumes its long-term interest rate increases.
And in the financial markets, the decline will begin before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that he will start raising interest rates, possibly already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market exchange pace before that.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they have done - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money interests as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been reached by the German bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategy Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle study.
The Bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies that produced the study and the report do not think they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market thereafter.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after Fedi’s interest rate increases.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as at the time of the previous interest rate increases - and what might result from it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more fragile condition to withstand rising interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year to the beginning of the recession.
Fedi’s monetary policy and its current stance have been led by leaders throughout last summer and early autumn to suggest that the time is getting ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate increase to over nine years could be this week.
This will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Fed meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, with which Fed raised interest from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended for exactly two years.
In 2007, the financial market started to suffer from the most risky housing problems in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
The major recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than has typically occurred since the previous Fedi interest rate increases.
Similarly, the trials were harder and tougher than ever since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world’s largest economies, as well as the turn of the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
From the 1950s onwards, they will report on Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial impact.
The time since the start of the recession is less than one year, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase in the financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of Fedi's interest rate increases.
Since the early 1950s, Fed has alternately increased and reduced its steering rate by a dozen cycles of different dimensions.
Each time has differed from others in some respects, and the times are relatively limited, so it is hardly possible to determine the effect of the subsequent interest rate increases.
Indeed, the strategies point out that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, may not be undisputed even by decades of research.
But there are three factors that have led to the crisis and have contributed to its destructive power:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks considered their key interest rates to be too low for too long.
They were patching up techno bubble tracks, and they were growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive debt to different parts of the financial and real economy increased even more as a result of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the economic history of the past was born.
3) In particular, crazy debt financing, which was almost imprecise in the financial economy, increased the biggest exchange-rate bubbles in the financial market to date from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
Nor is there much controversy about the fact that the financial markets, which had risen to higher levels on the basis of ever more complex debt levers, were in an exceptionally dangerous and unstable state when Fed and other central banks last drove interest rates up.
Financial structures geared to debt, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last until after interest rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had been reversed.
Risks materialised as a financial crisis and were followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not speculate on what will happen next, but give cause for thought by, for example, mentioning the following:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept the stance of their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time debt has not been crazy cheap as it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now in various parts of the economy the debt burden is much heavier than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the central banks has largely remained in the financial markets and has been the most expensive of key types of securities and assets since the peak or ever before the financial crisis.
And not only do the strategies flatten the mood with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession to the pattern that it has seen in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the pressures and risks of the financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis when Fed next starts to tighten up his money taps.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, the strategy of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
For some time now, he has trained international investors in Fed to turn around as follows:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fed to run off with even bigger QEs.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) who manufactures computers and printers plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are directed to HP Business Services, the company says.
In November HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring costs of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced to 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3300 in three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating results.
Even the other year, its three main customers imported 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system for your iPhone after Apple update release
You can ask for a new operating system by going to the Settings application, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you an option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems since this installation when a "Program Update Failed" error has appeared on the screen.
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to obtain status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the upgrade and also facilitated the process with a new tool that proposes the removal applications and then reinstalls them when the upgrade is completed.
You should make sure that your phone is loaded or near the charger during the upgrade that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the upgrade to proceed, as if the battery runs out, it may lead to a breakdown of the upgrade.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (central) has been a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities are related to so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says that he submitted his resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed time frame," Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs Board of Directors and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings are carried through a multi-step ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted for a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context," Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not associated with tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, Triton, already had a holding company in Luxembourg for the purpose of ownership.
Espoo offers a reception centre maintained by the company
The first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers will be opened in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants today, starting from the evening of six.
The number of seats may increase in the next week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service establishes a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on security arrangements for the Centre.
STTK is preparing an alternative labour market blackmail package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the government’s work-related blackmail.
The association also wishes to involve other employee centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday," Palola pointed out to journalists during a break at the administration meeting of the organization.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) does not, on the other hand, have the capacity for discussions.
The STTK economists have calculated that the security of change contained in the Government Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared with EUR 2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party is awfully eager to have a conversation if you're about to have one relationship with 100.
Palola: Negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the Government is due to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has always been constructive to him.
According to Palola, the cutting of Sunday supplements is a painful place.
The organization requires that the government withdraws from the mandatory legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to Mr Palola, the STTK does not welcome the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP, which has raised the issue.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the employment blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the wages of the first sick days are cut, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to take part in a demonstration and that the aim was not to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Mr Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, commends the STTK's announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now taking the same line with Akava, as Akava has been planning an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Mr Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, hopes that the SAK, chaired by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Earlier on Wednesday, Antti Palola STK reported that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitive leap by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been working on an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that goes to the country's government and employers," Fjäder says.
The Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

The Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday night at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's last speech, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech marking the beginning of the end of Mäntsälä's rebellion.
After that, the President and Ministers gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s address instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976 President Urho Kekkonen ended the train operator strike with a television talk.
Single call, monarchistic action.
All day long, Sipilä’s speech has aroused criticism and speculation about what is to come.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, stated that "Siplä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed".
According to Green Ville Niinistö, "we've already seen a single call.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned "monarchistism: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What's @hivasipara afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented live by the Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, and Jyri Häkämies, Managing Director of EK.
A lot of people have been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was a public service mission to promote the publicity of the whole of Finland, the director of Yle's publications in Ismo Silvo Yle's news.
♪ Like us in Tammel time ♪
The speech has also aroused ridicule.
In the evening dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mom's gonna put on a prettier hat, and my dad's gonna try on his neck.
At 9 a.m., we will be silent on TV as we used to be in Tammela's time," writes bloggari Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time claim to the people that they have to cut when the state is out of money?" says Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has published a bingo page on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, the same debt, the same team spirit tonight?
Ready the coupons and pens, it starts at 9:05 p.m. and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: the Western countries rejected the Russian proposal to overthrow al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to renounce power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian U.N. ambassador proposed a plan for Al-Assad to take a classy step away from power after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points for him in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and al-Assad's abandonment had to be carried out in a contained manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what to do," Ahtisaari recalls in the Guardian interview.
Diplomats No Comments
Ahtisaari says that he has delivered the message from the Czech Republic to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing has happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate, but Ahtisaari said that there were no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but they said that Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups refused any agreement that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari said, because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me what Cherkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep control of some of Al-Assad's supporters.
The Refugee Flow — Our Own Things
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own work.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The asylum seeker's organization centre is going to Tornio.
The asylum seeker organisation centre planned by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in an empty Tornio joint lyseo building in the city center.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsingin Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to present the school building as a solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left) Vice-President of Tornio City Council, this is not the case.
When the whole council was not here and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on it, he specified to the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present at the conference.
13 delegates objected to the Organization Centre.
On that basis, you could expect a positive decision, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and a rapid response was made.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could be accommodated in the joint lyse.
The expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is about 200 meters from the border, so it would also be functional in that sense," Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally), half of the holiday money being made public would only cover part of the government's efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on such a package.
Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for substitutes for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday money would be a way of doing so, as it would target almost all employees in contrast to the Sunday allowances proposed by the government, for example.
Labour market organisations could agree between themselves to cut holiday money because it is enshrined in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government will tell Parliament next Wednesday about the blackmail of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work will then start to take place, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
There's plenty of time.
It won't take long, if there is a will, for the Sipilä to formulate.
The list published last week by the government includes the conversion of the Epiphany and Helatorstai into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the wages of the first days of sickness are cut, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as a coercive legislation past the trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
In addition to organising a major demonstration on Friday, a number of trade unions have announced political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the Mahlahall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, which is a bit murmuring.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally talked about.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also a little surprised that the need for space was not known a year ago when the last extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk on the agenda of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting the technical director, Erkki Ikonen, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the locality.
There is no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Government eased its previous firm position to bring Karelian street names to the city centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language, because there is no historical basis for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savon dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian street names in the city center.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a unilingual municipality, it is also worth taking a broad-minded approach to the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland as a whole.
Both of them can well be used in the various marketing activities of the province.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the province's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the regional economy and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here at all," says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raises the issue of air transport, which has also been followed up on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the region as a whole that we should not be able to manage by means of government measures, as is now happening.
We should look at the effects of the closures of these transport links on employment, for example," Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of accessibility poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the faculty, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland, because the traffic connections are weak in the cross-sectional direction.
Approximately half of students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
In contrast, around 10-20 per cent of them are from New Zealand, partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel sound of Siu's war
The Joensuu City Council’s view of the regional Siu social project is apparently unanimous, but one of the gravel sounds is also included.
Pentti Keskisalo (sd., pictured) of the City Board member at Monday's meeting suggested that the whole project should be abandoned, but his proposal was unprofitable.
The Board approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give the final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one train crew.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train crew is left out, but still five times a day gets from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to state austerity measures.
The purchase money for rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely cut off.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys swerved.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed up the roof and couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki on the Ketotie at 8:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others swerved off the scene and passersby alerted the rescue department to help with the towing ladders to help the last one safely left on the roof back on the ground.
FedEx's operating profit is twofold, reducing the outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its profit forecast throughout the year, due to reduced demand for freight services and higher costs of its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire about 55 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year FedEx announced that it is hiring 50 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share decreased by approximately 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says that it expects the tax year to end next May at $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts were expecting $10.84, according to FactSet's poll.
Despite an average of 4.9% price increases, which will enter into force on 4 January, the lower outlook was achieved and despite higher additional charges for heavy or large parcels on land, which started in November.
The company said that it expects the operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, turnover has grown and the e-commerce is growing.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company 's performance is stable, taking into account weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in production and global trade'.
Plans for remuneration during the holiday were published the day after the competitor UPS announced that it intends to hire between 90 and 95 000 extra employees, about the same amount as it did last year.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
Profits per share came to $2.42, which is left behind in the $2.44 average forecast. 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority transport, which has halted the development of the turnover of its Express unit.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the land unit rose by 29 per cent, but the income of the operations was basically the same due to the high costs of larger parcels and own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx’s shares fell to $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 per cent down this year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
This week, the Governors of the Federal Reserve are sitting around a huge mahogany table at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two - story conference room is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank, and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
Congress has put two kinds of responsibility on the shoulders of the Central Bank: to maximise employment in the United States and to keep prices stable.
However, after the Great Depression, the central bank's leaders have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, recent turmoil in the global financial markets may have made it even more frightening for the pre-emptive central bank officials to become more unstable, and fear what would happen if the federal fund rate were raised by even one percentage point in a quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are, understandably, the first and most important issues to be monitored", says Lindsey M. Piegza, Senior Economic Specialist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for the retention of interest rates, the increased uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to justify waiting still," he says.
No agreement has been reached on the decision of the central bank, which is already causing the economy to become nervous.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, approximately half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial markets expect the Central Bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator shows that growth is only around 30%.
This refers to a fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers were able to soften the blow by promising that the next withdrawal would not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will maintain the level this week, says John Lonski, the chief financial expert of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It is surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they must make a great deal of effort in their policies to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that an increased level would reassure the financial markets as it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter this month, taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would confirm the stability of the recovery in the United States.
In spring and early summer, Yellen has said that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of pick-up.
Although inflation is still below the Central Bank's 2% annual target, the central bank's decision-makers believe that the main reason for this is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy 'will be able to cope with higher interest rates and will also need them in view of the tight situation in the labour market', says Ian Shepherdson, Chief Financial Specialist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index decreased by up to 16 per cent from its May record when investors feared that China's economy would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now close to 10% below the peak of May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells us when interest rates should be raised.
"Without these events in the financial markets and the recent news of China's economic weakness, the decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Olier, a specialist at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still very unclear and they have little information at their disposal as regards the consequences of the events in China," Oliner says.
The welfare of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, then president, implied that the central bank could "reduce" the increase in the amount of money, caused upheavals in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of the asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the Central Bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements which seem to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Mr Lacker, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the Central Bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "without worrying about its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth", Mr Lacker says.
A year later, the Central Bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to financial stability only during a major crisis, as Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Interest Rates Committee, said in 2008, when the market collapsed.
The latest turmoil does not come near its level," says Posen.
"No one wants to be in a situation where there is fear of raising interest rates because the market is upset," says Ponen, Chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability; as long as this is the case, I do not believe that they should anticipate it.

Brazil’s Paediatric Society in Rio Grande advertises a healthy diet to breast - feeders
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Association (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breast - feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with pictures of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven channel Sunrise program is a favourite in ratings, despite the efforts of Nine channel to announce the leader's exposure on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic's and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to announce the aftermath of the Liberal Party's leader's exposure failed to increase the number of viewers on Today.
The morning program for the Nine channel was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Army, was stuck in London as part of a series of international broadcasts that lasted that week, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance from the ballast did not seem to be a problem for Australian TV viewers, as the average of Sunrise’s viewers in five state capitals was 397,000, compared to 339,000 today.
Today's average rose slightly compared to the figures on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been catching Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, today's average was 318 000 and Sunrisen 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
So far in September, Sunrise’s average is 349 000 viewers, while Today’s figure is 314 000.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The changes this morning are blowing away from Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven channel was the 800 words series, where the former star Erik Thomson of the Packed to the Rafters series is performing an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered a fairly impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is the most popular force in the world without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this a real certainty.
Seven channel The X Factor was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the Block series (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726 000).
Seven had two kinds of fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
Andrew O'Keefe’s first half hour of the new quiz show (17-17.30) gathered an average of 446 000 viewers.
Another half hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 spectators - which was a small win enough for Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer averaged 520 000 viewers, while the second half-hour had a staggering 720 000 viewers.
Hot Seat's average was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night viewer average decline will bring the Nine channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the ratings of McGuire’s program.

The final three agree with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who wins the Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret, with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls are definitely not gonna slip who got the last rose.
However, when we talked to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, they could inadvertently give us a clue as to the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finals.
All three women became poetic when they told how Wood was the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family dignity and positiveness as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
When they were asked, however, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, who should it go to?" their answers could provide a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind for the whole series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really earthy, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now in this with all my heart," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the girls that are left just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarlyd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking questions about him since his impressive open day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first flight kick back when the team won Minnesota on Tuesday with 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next kick in the air and took him to a running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real nature of Tomsula was also visible in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits a patala in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
Cam Inman, a special editor of 49ers, reported that Haynea was also encouraged by Thomas McGaughey, a special team coordinator, who advised her to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarlyd Hayne dropped a kick in the air that Minnesota Vikings picked up in the first quarter of the game.
This really wasn't the beginning that Hayne and her many Australian fans were hoping for for a man's NFL debut.
Haynen was seen swearing on the way from the airport after the drop, and later he told Hamish & Andy 2DayFM on the 104.1 channel that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping with his 2007 Origin debut when the pass in his own finish area led to Queensland’s finish line.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photo published on her Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Mr Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 died while police were shooting rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four - year - old boy, died in southern Nepal from police shooting rubber bullets in a mob protesting against the country’s new draft constitution, the authority reported on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the highest official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protestors had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police were using tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have been killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The confrontation was the last in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution are undermining their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group is demanding its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent confrontations, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process since the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The National Hurricane Center of the United States NHC says that there is a 60% chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde.
On the broad low pressure front, which is about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verdean island group, there is a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center of the United States told on Tuesday.
On the second sharp low - pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verdean island group and the Small Antilles, there is also a 60 - percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami weather forecast centre added.
Google will start a donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at raising $111 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees from Europe fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective in its blog of the donation campaign.
Instead of being notified by the director, his personal experience was written by a Google employee named Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul at the age of seven with her family.
"Our journey included many dark journeys by train and bus, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it corresponds with the same amount to every donation made on Google.com/refugeerelief worldwide up to $5,5 million, with an overall target of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to the new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics may last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after a diet surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get the death data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on a new study in the JAMA Surgery magazine.
Various methods are used to reduce stomach size for weight loss surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the subjects in the study have been pathologically obese and have had a BMI of 35 or more.
BMI is considered normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if the BMI is over 30, they are considered obese.
You can count your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, for the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI for persons with surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of people who were treated with other means than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Of the persons who were cut, 36% improved their diabetes completely and 28% partially.
As a result of comparison, in the medically treated group diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partly by approximately 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholestor "were generally better in the surgical team", the authors noted.
Researchers also monitored patients’ blood haemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflect long-term blood glucose levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
After surgery, the haemoglobin A1c level dropped from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, it remained stable at around 8% in the treatment group.
However, this better "glycaemic control" described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over a period of five years," says Chief Researcher Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared with the gastric reduction surgery group, the gastric bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7% and 14.2 kg), decreased more than its body mass index (7.4 and 5.1), decreased more than its A1c level (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to have achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoneix Blackstone says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives for heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese patients undergoing weight loss surgery had a 29 - percent lower probability of dying over a 15 - year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely in showing that the surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group", he says, and there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugees' countries.
The Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama claimed that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put above the needs of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused a series of violent events.
"After 9/11 I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Over the last four years, children's ingestion of hand-disinfectant has increased four-fold.
Poison centres across the United States have reported an increase of almost 400 percent in the intake of alcohol-rich hand-disinfectant in children under 12 years of age since 2010, reports Georgia’s Poison Information Centre.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Poison Information Centre in Georgia, cases of ingestion of disinfectants reported to the Poison Information Centres in children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them go to emergency services," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or face the challenge of social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectants to get a cheap upholstery.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Comfortable odors of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand) are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
Especially in small children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few sprays.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," the director of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital Poison Center, Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So why don't you leave a shot of whiskey on the table, but the hand-disinfectant is left out, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who recently swallowed only four sprays of strawberry - scented hand disinfectant in school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the adult drink - driving limit, says emergency medical clinic physician Chris Ritchey, who treated a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed while talking and could not walk when he arrived in the emergency room.
The doctors followed him overnight in a separate children’s hospital for possible brain damage, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or alcohol wipes and remove the disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died from ingestion of hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York state, three fourth - graders planned to poison their “evil” teacher by applying bacterial poison to the classroom, reports a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and denied it in her class.
The police consider the plan to be a "flexible babble" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumour mill: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths detracts from Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she makes it turn.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football League for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard against January's recruitments, which could disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increased his lead to Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney’s first half kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and allowed the team to increase the gap to five points.
Griffiths minimizes the talk of contradictions
There have been rumours of internal conflicts in Celtic, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under close observation when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of Scottish championships bores the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers middle-fielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it does not compete with the Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador, de Boer, said: “In Holland, the highlights of Celtic’s games are no longer shown, and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People around here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tension, and also non-Scotlanders want to follow those games.
Deila swears she'll turn the situation around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League quickly resulted in a defeat for a ten - man Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series by five points to the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic's had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on guard against January’s player transfers
Although the Rangers boss Mark Warburton commented just a few weeks ago on possible targets for January’s player transfers, he is on guard against recruitment rage, assuring that he does not want to confuse the consensus of the gang.
The former boss of Brentford said, "The transfer window of January is very different from the window of summer."
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the whole period before, which is visible on our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic’s interest in Michu suggests retirement
The Swansea attacker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and was unable to find new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football League for Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later overturned, and this was already the third red card, condemned by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle.
The loyal Hibernia player was reprimanded for singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a whim for a while," the attacker said, adding, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I go to Celtic."
The tannadice government believes in the leadership of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the ability of the management team to reverse the situation, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together again," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about the "ugly victory" in Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, desperately hung up on the game against Hamilton Accies, but, thanks to Adam Rooney’s first half-time penalty kick, managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league victory, which raised them to the top of the table with five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that wouldn't have won games like this."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the UK's total growth
UNEMPLOYMENT In Scotland, 164 000 people remained between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK 5.5 per cent, the figures of the National Statistical Institute (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a period of three months, and the number of people in work is now 2 612 000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish State Secretary, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build the foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly one year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of Britain.
During these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention of any kind, I will see the man executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the viewers' gallery in Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
In January I received the request through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've begun to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and because there are often more applications than available places, the participants are selected through a horrendous draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the seats reserved for the media from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also made my own connection to him through calls made over the months and one two- and a half hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison officials say that I cannot be both a Witness and a journalist, so I must not have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner the way he wants you to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "it might have been better to put your words together," but he still feels that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that if he did.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
The Huffington Post reporter, Kim Bellware, is by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcasts I've made.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would in any case make him guilty of accessory.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view from which I watch him die.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
The man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he lured him out of the Canning River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to distract the police went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water only a few feet away from the policeman who tried to "tenderly lure him back to the beach".
The Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not coming out, come get me'," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "good police conference."
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but he inspired the locals to begin designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the agents tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that the officials of Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate his stables last year and threatens to stop competing immediately.
On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai on account of the treatment on the day of the race was the last rivet.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He's been keeping his tongue down on spy claims for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like envy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that it all goes off at once," Moody said.
They knew it was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head up and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I don't have to be a coach anymore.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Previously Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with the racing.com site, where he told us that the integrity department had tried to spy on his garage.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man, "and I named him when I asked him, "and offered him a job in my stables if he was going to pass on information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
Well, if that's the case, then they should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulton, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of it at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become manned and perhaps pass on responsibility to others besides coaches for what is happening in this field?
Do you think I'm harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the business?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they need to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I am saying now may cause them to think about that very thing.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it grieves me.
It really saddens me.
I'm pressuring them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach's frustration has increased with the long-standing Lidar Cobalt Study, and late rejection led him to find that he could "screw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the regulation on the day of the race's treatment to be "stupid" after the mud or clay tomb has been put on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud in his leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it yesterday, as it was.
He had it on the day of the race.
Moody may be faced with a three-month ban on competition due to the day-of-the-race poultice treatment from which the trustees began the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about a horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver in Cobram who was a fugitive driver arrested
The police have arrested a man who was on the run after hitting a cyclist at Cobram this weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after receiving serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man named Nathalia reported himself to the police in Sheppardon.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, neglecting aid and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Secretary Craig Bellamy of the Melbourne Storm team attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL-rugby league champions’ claims that his team’s tackles are part of the “lining”.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed Storm's "wrestling" on their own side when it suddenly won the final exam in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely cover up his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the finals. Bennett called the game the rugby league's "show window" and said that two Queensland teams were not "very excited" about wrestling.
Bellamy stood up for his team's tackles and said they're just focusing on "contact" when they tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was increased by two leading coaches criticism of Storm, which means that they are afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year long, and in the last six weeks, we've just been putting our hands on the tackles, and that's made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons, coached by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "satisfiedly".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 when St. George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has quick young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have those types of players.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his rugby style - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I become more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more point-rich than the one between Broncos and the Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the line of defense and not score?
For me, it's all about policy.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronull Sharks for the pre-finals next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
The Serb man has a $200,000 warrant for a drug charge.
A man threatened with a life sentence for an attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released for a sum of $200,000.
Twenty-nine-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drug to the Solay hunt, which came to South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic is threatening a life sentence in an attempt to hold a quantity of cocaine for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic was trying to hold the entire amount and that he could be in the café for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He's connected to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic’s mother and stepfather had together offered a bail sum of $200,000 to secure his release.
"After reading the sworn testimony of both individuals, it is clear that setting a bail sum of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But it alone was not enough to stop him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he surrenders both his passport to Australia and Serbia, reports to the police every day and maintains his curfew between 6 a.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online communications service where Hogg received numerous immoral pictures of children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and then immediately she told her mother.
When the police came in, they saw five pictures, examined the computers on the scene, and found "concerned" web searches with search words used to search for unruly images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to lure pedophiles" on the Internet before he "played himself a cop to scare them."
Mr Eilidh Robertson, the representative of the Fiscal Depute, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: 'He said that this is an addiction - that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and when Hogg asked him to send additional pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for bait.
He said that after drinking, he's sick in the head, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she screamed at her mother, shook and cried.
Mother saw the immoral pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used the computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, admitted his guilt for making or taking pictures of immoral children on 14 June last year. He broke his guarantee on 25 January of this year and failed to appear before the Court on 24 March of this year.
The defense attorney, Gregor Sim, asked that Hogg not be included in the sex offenders' register, since it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal suspended the sentence until October so that the social action has time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he's in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders' register before the date of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest leader of Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the podium.
He wasn't injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by the opposition legislators' claims that anonymous death threats had been sent to them, warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed and interrupted him with interlocutory calls when he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disturb Mugabe’s speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message is entitled 'Death'," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament and, when they step outside, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group discipline supervisor said that the party headed by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" by threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from its faster growing business equipment and services.
The expected job cuts will cost some $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, according to the HP release.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, Chairman of HP and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move to a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be over $50 billion, and it "focuss on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions" for companies, says the company's press release.
The division breaks down a company founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a graduate of Stanford University, in order to manufacture electrical supplies, in a garage in Palo Alto, which is called the birthplace of the Silicon Valley.
HP has been going through a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in an industry based on the belief that strictly limited companies are performing better.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now, and assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next games in England, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European championship next summer.
The greatest pity for this latest problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return in the middle of a period there is always the risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern in the formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has played only 65 games from the 157 league games of Arsenal.
Looking at Arsenal’s larger picture after the period 2007-08, for six seasons out of eight, it has been one of the Champion League teams that has lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement in injury statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when returning from the injury can be a predisposed period, when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will make the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a breather to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite of the F block, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Also, Dinamo has not lost 41 matches since they produced their own "invincible" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
That was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lessons of last season's Champions League's surrender to Monaco, and he is still motivated by the distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain and is three times more common among men than among women.
The company addresses the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 for men's year. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2,000 secondary school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, the chances of recovery doubled if the percentage of their friends were "healthy" enough.
Similarly, those who were not depressed were halved in the likelihood of possible mental problems if they had healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this social media through communication time style goes past content and the instantness of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy, and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call externality: money, image, social status. All of this happens at the expense of internal values - the personal growth and friendship of inner longing - that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The fineness of the frendie was just that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished by interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs, watching football, Ross longing for Rachel - their sense of humor came from the fact that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the Samaritans volunteer explained to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really understand how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make them feel better."
Often, men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you see them as weak.
Frends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position at the other end of the phone helps people at times of despair, long - term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And if you're going to the Friendsfest at Comedy Central this weekend, and all the locations are redesigned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for coffee?
Or better yet, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria is partying with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in her debut of the Champions League, helping the PSG to bypass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right track when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored in her Champions League debut for less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French League champions, but the team lost several chances before finally increasing their head start when Cavan scored the goal by 61 minutes.
Paris, who is in the same Pool A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetski, needed a strong start against the Swedish League Champion, as there was not only an extension, but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter finals in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the goal and later changed from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at guests in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for your opponent and look good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we're going to have to work on this season," Blanc said.
This is for good.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we did not manage to score one or two more goals.
After being injured, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team in one of the three changes made after the team was left at the 2-trace at Ligue 1’s home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he was left in the shadow of Di Maria for the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named a man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran behind the Malmö defense line behind Marco Verratt’s pitch and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland to the back corner of the net.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from the PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a clogged opponent. It won the Celtic solution game when it reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and five-man defenses and two players deep in the middle field.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than the 34th minute of Nikola Djurdjic's shot, which went right past Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
On the other hand, the PSG was in trouble at times because of lost feeds and poor finish, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in the first half alone, and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from the touch of Ibrahimovic right at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing pre-work for his colleagues, and it was at Ibrahimovic’s pitch that Di Maria sent out a spiral kick that tilted around Wiland’s goalpost at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of the game, thanks to Cavan, who had scored his sixth goal in the season, after Ibrahimovic had snapped on the left of Maxwell’s cross pass.
That was the end of Malmö’s hopes of getting back in the game, and only Wiland’s brilliant fight for David Luiz’s direct kick kept the final score down before Ezequiel Lavezzi’s goal from the exchange was rejected right at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
There's not enough qualifying matches.
I'm gonna lift my hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock sales.
On Wednesday, Glencore, who was left by the mining industry in Switzerland, suffered from the collapse of commodities, raised $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, announced in his announcement that it had sold new shares worth some £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
A company that lost 57% of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy is putting pressure on demand and causing damage in all markets.
The new subscription put the value of Glencore's shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in the morning shops on Wednesday.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed the previous week as part of a 2.5 billion - dollar share transaction as part of his wider plan to cut its 30 billion - dollar debt by about a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 pence of the share, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the closing price of Tuesday.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about the long-standing stagnation of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping makes a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement published by the White House on Tuesday confirmed.

Matt Damon minimizes the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon brought up an African-American filmmaker, Effie Brown, when they were discussing a difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
In the HBO Sunday night Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown, highlighting the need for different perspectives as regards the black main character of the selected manuscript.
"When we talk about diversity, it will be taken into account when choosing actors for the movie, not the show," Damon said.
Shocked Brown reacted with disbelief, commenting on "Oh! Wow. Okay", while the comments of The Martian's actor remained hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrely brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to encourage people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is a whore beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the rights to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their direction "could end up giving us something we don't want".
When the conversation was sent out, the social media exploded to resent Damon's comments.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, writing: "Matt Damon talking on the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts."
After its publication, the tweeting collected more than 5000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments coincide with the time when a precise racial performance in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the killing of teenage Michael Brown by a white policeman in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album of the Year candidates as the Grammy Prize winner.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently published a statement to answer the question of Fox News’ television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the pope to discuss the Catholic Church’s image in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
Professional rock climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and won a million-dollar prize.
It is precisely in the seventh season of the competition programme that there has never been a competitor who has survived all the sections of the obstacle course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last mission was to climb a 20-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared up the challenge on time, making him the first athlete of all time to figure out the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult victory and was still in shock for winning the million-dollar prize.
"So it's great to think that I've never made or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this is gonna be like... the future is unknown.
Production manager Kent Weed sat down to discuss the finer and why Britten does not get more reward money, even though he is the first competitor of all time who has managed to pass the track.
The rules are that money goes to the fastest person.
"If more than one person passes, the one with the fastest time will get the money," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great feeling of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he has a grudge.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, which will start shooting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers snuck past Minnesota Twins.
The other half of the season hasn't been very fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams, but he's the last in the American League Central Division.
Tigers played his prankster role perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get half a game away from Houston Astros in a competition for another American League Wild Card spot.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter "H" word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
"All profits are fun, no matter how you get them," said Brad Ausmus, Team Leader of Tigers.
Alfredo Simon, who pitched Tigers, continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two turns, and then again in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 in the inning and let three runs go.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changeling to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers’ surrogate Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs that were his first beat since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-shot night since he hit four Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (at batting exercises), looked much better at batting exercises and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and it was their best chance to get back into the game.
Senteri Byron Buxton started the line by hitting out twice on the left field line.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks returned with a one - nest click, and Simon was able to burn the second - nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced with the left - handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player standing against him, Miguel Sano, the first rookie, who pulled two nests to the left from right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners out on the field and a levelling runner in second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit a double-game goalie.
It was the record of the main series: the 27th time this season Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had won the safe run at the ninth start, Mauer pulled two beat runs against Tigers’ closer Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
The right-handed player, however, burned the Word in three strokes in his fifth salvation.
In the beginning, Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list before the game after being off for more than a month due to lower back infection.
"It's obvious I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I could make a few nice pitches on the third line."
After Hughes picked up the starter at the first base, he let the second base player Ian Kinsler move forward in the middle.
J.D. Martinez's walk on the right side in two fires brought Victor Martinez, who took himself in the middle of the field to first base and made the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipe while the runners were in good running positions.
The third base player Nick Castellanos continued to hit the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected as he tried to advance to third base.
Tigers continued with the second inning and got one fire, a two-hive situation from the runner James McCann and a two-fire, one-hidden run from Anthony Gose, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important shot," said Twins team leader Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be at the pass and fed a running third inning, after which he was replaced by A.J. Achter, a right-handed extension.
Hughes was counted three runs for six strokes and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: The right-handed pitcher of Tigers, Anibal Sanchez, was driven away by a sprain on the shoulder of the throw hand.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder strain, but he was due back on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will be on the list of injured people to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four initiatives since David Price, the left-handed pitcher, was replaced with him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th because of a real crooked absore.
Tigers and Twins' three-game series will end on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) is opposed to Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) the right-handed pitcher of Minnesota.
Xi calls for the wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy must open up more to the outside world to promote growth," President Xi Jinping told Tuesday to the group whose task is to guide the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency", he said when he spoke at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the overall reform.
Promoting transparency while pushing reforms forward with more new momentum and vitality, and creating a new space for economic growth," said Xi.
The Management Group approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list of restrictions on market access, a relaxation of the principles of border controls, a call on state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list of sectors and undertakings not eligible for investment will be created.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This change is significant because it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also relaxes its control over the power it distributes to companies, thereby ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business activities.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new forms of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors will be opened up in order to open up state-controlled sectors to private investors.
"The government does not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," said the opinion.
In addition, the search process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, green cards, will be facilitated by optimising requirements and lightening the search process.
The meeting also discussed the safeguarding of the professional rights of lawyers and the promotion of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in a post-meeting opinion.
